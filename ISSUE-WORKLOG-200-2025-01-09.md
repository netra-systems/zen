# Issue #200 Work Log - WebSocket Event Emitter Consolidation
**Created:** 2025-01-09  
**Issue:** SSOT-incomplete-migration-WebSocket Event Emitter Consolidation  
**Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR at risk from race conditions blocking Golden Path

## Status Updates

### 2025-01-09 - Initial Assessment
**Current State:** 50% COMPLETE with critical gaps blocking Golden Path

**Progress Found:**
- SSOT UnifiedWebSocketEmitter implemented at `/netra_backend/app/websocket_core/unified_emitter.py`
- Performance improvements achieved (2.4x throughput)
- Comprehensive test suite in place
- Redirection wrapper pattern established

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
1. UnifiedWebSocketEmitter API signature issues (1-2 hours)
2. Transparent events redirection validation needed (2-3 hours)
3. Race conditions still present affecting $500K+ ARR chat

**Five Whys Analysis:**
- **Why multiple emitters?** Lack of architectural governance during rapid development
- **Why not consolidated initially?** SSOT patterns not enforced in early codebase
- **Why blocking Golden Path?** Race conditions prevent reliable event delivery  
- **Why affecting $500K+ ARR?** Chat functionality depends on WebSocket events
- **Why not resolved yet?** API compatibility issues preventing final migration

**Business Confidence:** HIGH - Clear technical path to completion
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM - Critical chat functionality at risk until resolved

**Next Actions:**
1. Fix API signature compatibility issues
2. Complete transparent events redirection 
3. Validate 100% SSOT compliance
4. Eliminate all race conditions
