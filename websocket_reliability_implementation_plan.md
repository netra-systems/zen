# WebSocket Reliability Implementation Plan

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)
1. **Segment**: Growth & Enterprise
2. **Business Goal**: Prevent revenue loss from connection failures
3. **Value Impact**: Ensures 99.9% message delivery, preventing $50K+ MRR churn
4. **Revenue Impact**: Direct prevention of customer churn due to reliability issues

## Executive Summary
This plan addresses 5 critical WebSocket reliability issues that cause silent failures and data loss. Each fix is designed to be atomic, testable, and maintain backward compatibility.

## Implementation Priority Order

### Phase 1: CRITICAL - Data Loss Prevention (Issues #1, #2)
**Timeline**: Immediate
**Risk**: Permanent data loss, state desynchronization

### Phase 2: HIGH - State Corruption (Issue #3)
**Timeline**: Within 24 hours
**Risk**: Resource exhaustion, connection failures

### Phase 3: MEDIUM - Monitoring & Callbacks (Issues #4, #5)
**Timeline**: Within 48 hours  
**Risk**: Degraded observability, missed state updates

## Detailed Implementation Tasks

### Issue #1: Non-Transactional Batch Flushing
**File**: `app/services/websocket/batch_message_core.py`
**Root Cause**: Messages removed from queue before send confirmation

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add message state enum: `PENDING`, `SENDING`, `SENT`, `FAILED`
2. Implement mark-and-sweep pattern:
   - Mark messages as `SENDING` (don't remove)
   - Attempt send with retry logic
   - Only remove on confirmed `SENT`
   - Revert to `PENDING` on failure
3. Add retry queue for failed messages
4. Implement exponential backoff for retries
5. Add metrics for retry attempts and failures

**Test Requirements**:
- Simulate network failure during batch send
- Verify 100% message retention
- Test retry mechanism with backoff

### Issue #2: Ignored Synchronization Exceptions
**File**: `app/services/websocket/state_synchronizer.py`
**Root Cause**: `return_exceptions=True` without result inspection

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Capture and inspect gather results
2. Classify exceptions by severity:
   - Critical: Stop processing, enter error state
   - Warning: Log and continue with degraded mode
3. Implement callback failure handler
4. Add failure propagation for critical callbacks
5. Add metrics for callback success/failure rates

**Test Requirements**:
- Force exception in critical callback
- Verify system enters error state
- Test non-critical callback resilience

### Issue #3: Ghost Connection State Corruption
**File**: `app/services/websocket/connection_manager.py`
**Root Cause**: Failed closures leave connections tracked

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add connection state enum: `ACTIVE`, `CLOSING`, `FAILED`, `CLOSED`
2. Implement atomic state transitions
3. Add cleanup scheduler for failed connections
4. Implement force-close mechanism with timeout
5. Add ghost connection detection and cleanup

**Test Requirements**:
- Simulate close() method failure
- Verify connection marked as `FAILED`
- Test cleanup scheduler removes ghosts

### Issue #4: Exception Swallowing in Callbacks
**File**: `app/services/websocket/reconnection_manager.py`
**Root Cause**: Critical callbacks fail silently

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add callback criticality classification
2. Implement failure impact assessment
3. Add circuit breaker for repeated failures
4. Implement callback failure notifications
5. Add fallback mechanisms for critical callbacks

**Test Requirements**:
- Test critical vs non-critical callback handling
- Verify circuit breaker activation
- Test fallback mechanism engagement

### Issue #5: Partial Monitoring Failures
**File**: `app/services/websocket/performance_monitor_core.py`
**Root Cause**: Sequential checks skip on early failure

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Parallelize all monitoring checks
2. Implement independent check execution
3. Add partial failure reporting
4. Implement check result aggregation
5. Add monitoring coverage metrics

**Test Requirements**:
- Force failure in first check
- Verify all other checks execute
- Test partial failure reporting

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Each fix must include comprehensive unit tests
- Mock network failures, exceptions, timeouts
- Test edge cases and race conditions

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end message flow with failures
- Multi-user connection scenarios
- Load testing with induced failures

### Stress Testing
- 24-hour reliability test
- 1000+ concurrent connections
- Random failure injection

## Rollback Plan
Each fix is designed to be independently deployable and rollback-safe:
1. Feature flags for each major change
2. Backward compatible message formats
3. Gradual rollout with monitoring
4. Automated rollback on error rate spike

## Success Metrics
- Message delivery rate: 99.9%
- Zero silent failures in 24-hour test
- Ghost connection rate: 0%
- Monitoring coverage: 100%
- Mean time to recovery: <30 seconds

## Agent Task Distribution

### Agent Pool Requirements
- 5 specialized fix agents (one per issue)
- 5 test implementation agents
- 3 integration testing agents
- 2 documentation agents
- 5 code review agents

### Parallel Execution Plan
1. Deploy fix agents for all 5 issues simultaneously
2. Each agent works on isolated module (no conflicts)
3. Test agents create tests in parallel
4. Integration after individual fixes complete
5. Final review and merge

## Compliance Validation
- Run `python scripts/check_websocket_reliability.py` after each fix
- Ensure 300-line module limit maintained
- Verify 8-line function limit
- Check type safety compliance
- Validate test coverage >80%

## Post-Implementation
1. Update monitoring dashboards
2. Create runbook for failure scenarios
3. Schedule reliability review in 2 weeks
4. Document lessons learned in SPEC/learnings/
