## üîç COMPREHENSIVE FIVE WHYS ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - Issue #1021

### **WebSocket Event Structure Validation Failures - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Test design mismatch between expected mock behavior and real staging services.

## Five Whys Analysis Results:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **WHY are WebSocket events failing structure validation?**
- Server returns `connection_established` events instead of agent-specific events (`agent_started`, `tool_executing`, `tool_completed`)
- Test expects `type="agent_started"` but receives `type="connection_established"`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **WHY are tool_name and results fields missing?**
- Events received are connection acknowledgments, NOT tool events
- `validate_event_content_structure()` expects:
  - `tool_executing`: `["type", "tool_name", "parameters", "timestamp"]`  
  - `tool_completed`: `["type", "tool_name", "results", "duration", "timestamp"]`
- Server sends: `{"type": "connection_established", "data": {...}, "timestamp": ...}`

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **WHY is event structure not matching expected format?**
- Test falls back to staging: `"Service backend failed health check - falling back to staging"`
- Successfully connects to staging WebSocket but only receives handshake events
- Test sends mock `agent_started_event` but doesn't trigger real agent workflow

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **WHY wasn't this caught by earlier validation?**
- Recent migration to "real services" and staging fallback
- Test designed for local/mock echo behavior - expects sent events to be returned
- Staging environment doesn't echo test events back for validation

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **WHY did event format change?**
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Test design assumes mock environment where events echo back
- Staging only sends `connection_established` on successful connection
- Real agent events only occur during actual agent execution workflows
- SSOT migrations exposed this mock-to-real service design gap

## üéØ **RESOLUTION STRATEGY**

### **Immediate Fix Required:**
1. **Modify test to trigger real agent workflows** instead of expecting event echo
2. **Send actual user message** that triggers agent execution pipeline
3. **Wait for real agent events** from workflow execution, not connection handshake

### **Code Changes Needed:**
```python
# Instead of this (mock pattern):
await self.test_context.send_message(agent_started_event)
received_event = await self.test_context.receive_message()  # Expects echo

# Do this (real service pattern):  
user_message = {"type": "chat_message", "message": "test request"}
await self.test_context.send_message(user_message)
# Wait for real agent workflow events: agent_started, tool_executing, etc.
```

### **Business Impact Protected:**
- ‚úÖ **$500K+ ARR** Golden Path validation will work with real agent workflows
- ‚úÖ **Mission Critical** tests will properly validate staging environment  
- ‚úÖ **Chat functionality** can be comprehensively tested end-to-end

## üìã **Next Actions:**
1. Update test to send real user messages instead of mock events
2. Implement proper agent workflow triggering
3. Validate with staging environment 
4. Ensure all 5 critical events are captured from real execution

**Status**: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - Ready for implementation
