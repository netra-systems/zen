## Known Issues and Recommendations

### Infrastructure Concerns (Separate from Issue #1296)
1. **Backend 503 Responses**: Intermittent 503 responses during high load
   - **Root Cause**: Infrastructure scaling configuration, not authentication related
   - **Recommendation**: Separate infrastructure optimization issue
   - **Status**: Does not impact authentication functionality

2. **GCP Cloud Run Scaling**: Potential cold start optimization needed
   - **Recommendation**: Review Cloud Run concurrency and scaling settings
   - **Status**: Infrastructure optimization, separate from authentication work

### Future Enhancements
1. **Session Management**: Consider implementing session clustering for high availability
2. **Performance**: Additional Redis optimization for high-scale deployments  
3. **Security**: Regular security audits and penetration testing
4. **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring and alerting for authentication events
