## Quick Start Commands

### 1. Immediate Issue Detection (Run First)
```bash
# Test all Issue #1278 detection tests
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --marker issue_1278 --env staging --no-docker

# Expected: Unit tests PASS, Integration/E2E/Infrastructure tests FAIL
```

### 2. Individual Test Category Execution

#### Unit Tests (Should PASS - Configuration Validation)
```bash
# Run unit tests for timeout configuration validation
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file tests/unit/test_issue_1278_database_connectivity_timeout_validation.py

# Expected Result: ✅ ALL PASS (configuration is correct)
```

#### Integration Tests (Should FAIL - Connectivity Issues)
```bash
# Run integration tests for database connectivity
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file tests/integration/test_issue_1278_database_connectivity_integration.py --env staging

# Expected Result: ❌ FAIL with timeout/connectivity errors
```

#### E2E Staging Tests (Should FAIL - Golden Path Blocked)
```bash
# Run E2E staging tests for Golden Path validation
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file tests/e2e/staging/test_issue_1278_golden_path_validation.py --env staging

# Expected Result: ❌ FAIL - Golden Path completely blocked
```

#### Infrastructure Tests (Should FAIL - Infrastructure Degraded)
```bash
# Run infrastructure health validation
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file tests/infrastructure/test_issue_1278_infrastructure_health_validation.py

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Import Errors
```bash
# If you get import errors for netra_backend modules:
export PYTHONPATH=/c/netra-apex:$PYTHONPATH

# Or run from project root:
cd /c/netra-apex
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --marker issue_1278
```

#### 2. Test Framework Issues
```bash
# If unified_test_runner has issues:
pytest tests/unit/test_issue_1278_database_connectivity_timeout_validation.py -v

# For specific test:
pytest tests/integration/test_issue_1278_database_connectivity_integration.py::TestIssue1278DatabaseConnectivityIntegration::test_staging_database_connectivity_real_vpc_connector -v -s
```

#### 3. Environment Configuration Issues
```bash
# Verify environment setup:
python -c "from shared.isolated_environment import get_env; print(get_env().get('ENVIRONMENT'))"

# Set explicitly if needed:
export ENVIRONMENT="staging"
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://staging_connection_string"
```

#### 4. Network Connectivity Issues
```bash
# Test basic network connectivity:
curl -I https://staging.netrasystems.ai/health

# Test staging endpoints:
nslookup staging.netrasystems.ai
nslookup api-staging.netrasystems.ai
```
