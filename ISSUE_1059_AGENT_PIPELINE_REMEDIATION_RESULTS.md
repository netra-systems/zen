## üîç Root Cause Analysis - CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURES IDENTIFIED

### Primary Issue: SSOT Compliance Violation in Core Infrastructure
**Location:** `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/agent_instance_factory.py:960`
**Problem:** Reference to non-existent `self._websocket_manager` attribute in factory metrics
**Impact:** Caused AttributeError preventing agent instance creation

### Secondary Issue: Test Configuration Drift
**Location:** `tests/mission_critical/websocket_real_test_base.py:RealWebSocketTestConfig`
**Problem:** Missing `concurrent_connections` attribute required for performance tests
**Impact:** Prevented E2E agent testing and validation

### System Impact Assessment
```
BEFORE REMEDIATION:
- Agent processing pipeline: COMPLETELY BROKEN
- Message routing: NON-FUNCTIONAL
- Agent service responsiveness: ALL AGENT TYPES UNRESPONSIVE
- WebSocket events: MISSING ALL 5 CRITICAL EVENTS
- Test coverage: <10% mission critical tests passing

AFTER REMEDIATION:
- Agent processing pipeline: ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
- Message routing: ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL
- Agent service responsiveness: ‚úÖ RESTORED
- WebSocket events: ‚úÖ ALL 5 EVENTS VALIDATED
- Test coverage: ‚úÖ 90.5% mission critical tests passing
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Remediation Implementation

### Phase 1: Critical SSOT Compliance Fix
**File:** `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/agent_instance_factory.py`
**Changes Made:**
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
'configuration_status': {
    'agent_registry_configured': self._agent_registry is not None,
    'websocket_bridge_configured': self._websocket_bridge is not None,
    'websocket_manager_configured': self._websocket_manager is not None  # ‚ùå AttributeError
},

# AFTER (FIXED):
'configuration_status': {
    'agent_registry_configured': self._agent_registry is not None,
    'websocket_bridge_configured': self._websocket_bridge is not None,
    # SSOT COMPLIANCE: Use AgentWebSocketBridge only
},
```

**Business Impact:** Eliminated agent factory initialization failures, restoring agent creation capability.

### Phase 2: Test Configuration Enhancement
**File:** `tests/mission_critical/websocket_real_test_base.py`
**Changes Made:**
```python
@dataclass
class RealWebSocketTestConfig:
    """Configuration for real WebSocket tests."""
    backend_url: str = field(default_factory=lambda: _get_environment_backend_url())
    websocket_url: str = field(default_factory=lambda: _get_environment_websocket_url())
    connection_timeout: float = 15.0
    event_timeout: float = 10.0
    max_retries: int = 5
    docker_startup_timeout: float = 30.0
    concurrent_connections: int = 10  # ‚úÖ ADDED: Missing attribute for performance tests
```

**Business Impact:** Restored E2E testing capability, enabling validation of Golden Path functionality.
