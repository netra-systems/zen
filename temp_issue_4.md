# P1 Import Issue: Missing 'test_execution_engine_comprehensive_real_services' module during test execution

## Problem Description
Integration test is failing due to missing import of `test_execution_engine_comprehensive_real_services` module during test execution, despite the module existing and being importable manually.

## Affected Files
- `netra_backend/tests/integration/test_execution_engine_advanced_scenarios.py:75`

## Error Details
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'test_execution_engine_comprehensive_real_services'
```

## Root Cause Analysis
Investigation reveals the module exists and can be imported manually:
- Module exists at `./netra_backend/tests/integration/test_execution_engine_comprehensive_real_services.py`
- Manual import test succeeds from same directory
- Issue appears to be test runner/environment/path configuration related

## Import Analysis
Test file attempts to import:
```python
from test_execution_engine_comprehensive_real_services import (
    MockToolForTesting,
    MockAgentForTesting,
    ExecutionEngineTestContext
)
```

## Test Results
✅ **Manual Import Test**: Successfully imported from same directory context
❌ **Test Runner Import**: Fails during test execution with ModuleNotFoundError

## Potential Causes
1. **Python Path Configuration**: Test runner may not include current directory in path
2. **Test Discovery Configuration**: Pytest/test runner path resolution issue
3. **Module Naming Convention**: File not following expected test module patterns
4. **Working Directory**: Test execution from different working directory

## Business Impact
- Advanced execution engine integration tests cannot run
- Test coverage gaps in complex execution scenarios
- Potential deployment blocking if these tests are required

## Recommended Solution
1. **Investigate test runner configuration** - Check pytest.ini, conftest.py settings
2. **Convert to absolute import** - Use full module path import
3. **Move to proper location** - Ensure module follows test infrastructure patterns
4. **Update test discovery** - Verify test infrastructure can locate the module

## Investigation Priority
P1 - Critical test infrastructure blocking integration test execution
