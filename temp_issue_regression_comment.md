## üö® REGRESSION DETECTED - Issue #915 ExecutionEngine Import Failures NOT Fully Resolved

### New Evidence - Test File Still Using Deprecated Import
**File:** `tests/unit/agents/test_execution_engine_migration_validation.py`  
**Lines 20-22:** Still contains deprecated import:
```python
from netra_backend.app.agents.supervisor.execution_engine import (
    ExecutionEngine as SupervisorExecutionEngine
)
```

**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'netra_backend.app.agents.supervisor.execution_engine'`

### Impact Assessment
- **P0 Priority:** Blocks agent execution validation testing
- **Business Risk:** Affects $500K+ ARR agent functionality validation  
- **Golden Path Risk:** Prevents comprehensive execution engine migration testing
- **Test Collection:** File fails to import, preventing test discovery

### Root Cause
Despite the comprehensive resolution analysis, this specific test file was **not updated** during the SSOT migration. The file still attempts to import from the deprecated path.

### SSOT Import Registry Confirmation
According to `docs/SSOT_IMPORT_REGISTRY.md` lines 154-157:
```python
# ‚ùå DEPRECATED: Direct import no longer supported
from netra_backend.app.agents.supervisor.execution_engine import ExecutionEngine
# ‚úÖ USE INSTEAD: 
from netra_backend.app.agents.supervisor.user_execution_engine import UserExecutionEngine as ExecutionEngine
```

### Required Action
This specific test file requires immediate import path correction to prevent continued test collection failures.

### Status Update
Issue #915 should be **REOPENED** or tracked separately until this regression is addressed.
