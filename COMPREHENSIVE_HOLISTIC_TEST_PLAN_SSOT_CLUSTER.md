## Testing Infrastructure Requirements

### Non-Docker Execution Strategy
Following CLAUDE.md requirements for non-Docker testing approach:

#### Real Service Integration
```bash
# Primary execution pattern - no Docker dependency
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --real-services --no-docker --category mission_critical

# Service-specific validation
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --real-services --service backend --category integration
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --real-services --service auth --category security
```

#### Test Environment Configuration
```python
# Use IsolatedEnvironment for all environment access
from shared.isolated_environment import IsolatedEnvironment
env = IsolatedEnvironment()

# Real database connections (no mocks in integration/E2E)
from test_framework.database_test_utilities import DatabaseTestUtilities
db_utils = DatabaseTestUtilities(use_real_connections=True)

# Real WebSocket connections for event validation
from netra_backend.app.websocket_core.websocket_manager import WebSocketManager
ws_manager = WebSocketManager(test_mode=False)  # Real connections
```

#### Validation Tooling Requirements
- **SSOT Import Registry:** Authoritative import validation using `/SSOT_IMPORT_REGISTRY.md`
- **UserExecutionContext Factory:** Real factory pattern testing with proper isolation
- **WebSocket Event Monitor:** Real-time event delivery validation
- **Enterprise Compliance Tracker:** GDPR/SOC2 audit trail validation

### Test Execution Order and Dependencies

#### Sequential Dependencies (Must Execute in Order)
1. **Phase 1 (Security)** → **Phase 2 (Business)** → **Phase 4 (Integration)**
   - Security foundation must be solid before business workflow testing
   - Business workflows must work before cross-cluster integration testing

#### Parallel Processing Opportunities
- **Phase 3 (Infrastructure)** can run parallel with **Phase 1 (Security)**
- **Phase 5 (Regression)** can run parallel with other phases as validation

#### Dependency Chain Validation
