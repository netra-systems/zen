"""
FACTORY CLEANUP REMEDIATION: This factory was removed as unnecessary over-engineering.

Original file: netra_backend/app/agents/execution_engine_unified_factory.py
Reason: Over-engineered wrapper factory that provided no business value
Backup: netra_backend/app/agents/execution_engine_unified_factory.py.backup_pre_factory_removal

MIGRATION PATH:
- If this was a simple wrapper, use the canonical implementation directly
- If this provided compatibility, update imports to use the canonical source
- Check backup file for original implementation if needed

Business Value Impact: POSITIVE - Reduces complexity while maintaining functionality
SSOT Compliance: IMPROVED - Eliminates duplicate abstraction layers
