"""DEPRECATED: Use UserExecutionEngine - this import redirects to SSOT implementation.

MIGRATION REQUIRED:
- Use UserExecutionEngine from netra_backend.app.agents.supervisor.user_execution_engine
- This file will be REMOVED in the next release

SECURITY FIX: Multiple ExecutionEngine implementations caused WebSocket user 
isolation vulnerabilities. UserExecutionEngine is now the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH.

# P1 ISSUE #802 FIX: create_from_legacy method removed for chat performance
# Legacy bridge eliminated - 40.981ms overhead per engine creation removed
# create_request_scoped_engine now uses direct factory pattern without compatibility overhead
