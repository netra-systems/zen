  </prompt_response>
  <prompt_response>
    <prompt>Does Netra support integration with open-source or self-hosted models?</prompt>
    <response>Yes, Netra provides system-level visibility and optimization capabilities for both third-party APIs and self-hosted models. It has specific features designed to help teams unlock the full potential of their own silicon, such as mastering scheduler trade-offs and de-risking advanced optimization strategies.</response>
  </prompt_response>
  <prompt_response>
    <prompt>Is Netra a cloud-based platform (SaaS), or can it be deployed on-premise?</prompt>
    <response>Netra offers flexible deployment options. While it operates as a SaaS platform, it also provides enterprise clients the option to host the platform in their own private cloud (VPC) for maximum security and to ensure 100% data residency within their own networks. </response>
  </prompt_response>
  <prompt_response>
    <prompt>Can I get a trial period before I invest with Netra AI?</prompt>
    <response>Yes, Netra offers a pilot program that functions as a risk-free trial. As part of the pilot, Netra provides a free cost analysis and initial optimization recommendations based on your company's own log data. This allows you to see a personalized savings report and understand the potential ROI before making any investment. </response>
  </prompt_response>
  <prompt_response>
    <prompt>Are there discounts available for startups or individuals?</prompt>
    <response>The free forever tier and the low-cost Professional plan is designed to be accessible for early-stage startups and individual users. </response>

  <prompt_response>
    <prompt>How does Netra analyze my existing AI usage and logs?</prompt>
    <response>Netra analyzes your existing AI usage by connecting securely to your production logs, typically from a database like ClickHouse. This connection is read-only and operates on sanitized data where PII has been removed. Once connected, the platform ingests this historical data and applies its analytics engine to identify patterns, inefficiencies, and optimization opportunities across over 30 categories. It transforms this raw log data into actionable insights, such as pinpointing costly model settings, identifying opportunities for caching, and modeling the impact of switching to different LLM providers.</response>
  </prompt_response>
  <prompt_response>
    <prompt>Can Netra audit my past AI spending and performance without requiring changes to my live application or infrastructure?</prompt>
    <response>Yes, absolutely. The initial log analysis feature is specifically designed to audit your past AI spending and performance without requiring any changes to your live application or infrastructure. The entire process is passive and risk-free. It works by securely connecting to a read-only, sanitized copy of your historical logs to generate a comprehensive analysis and savings forecast.</response>
  </prompt_response>
  <prompt_response>
    <prompt>Is any code modification required to start the historical log analysis?</prompt>
    <response>No, there are no code modifications required to start the historical log analysis. The process is designed to be non-intrusive and only requires setting up a secure, read-only connection to your existing log data source, such as a ClickHouse database.</response>
  </prompt_response>
  <prompt_response>
    <prompt>How quickly can I see an estimate of potential savings using the log analysis feature?</prompt>
    <response>After providing Netra with access to your sanitized log data, you can expect to receive a cost analysis and initial savings recommendations in under 48 hours.</response>
  </prompt_response>
  <prompt_response>
    <prompt>Which platforms and data sources can I connect for log ingestion ?</prompt>
    <response>The platform allows integration with Datadog and ClickHouse for log ingestion at the moment. </response>
  </prompt_response>
  <prompt_response>
    <prompt>How does Netra process and standardize different or incomplete log formats?</prompt>
    <response>Netra has a pre-built, automated ETL pipeline that normalizes the data into a standard format.</response>
  </prompt_response>
  <prompt_response>
    <prompt>What changes are required in my application to use the Gateway?</prompt>
    <response>The primary change required in your application to use the Optimization Gateway is to modify the API endpoint configuration. You will need to change the API base URL that your application uses for LLM calls to point to the URL provided by Netra for its gateway service.</response>
  </prompt_response>
  <prompt_response>
    <prompt>What is the recommended approach for getting started with Netra? Should I analyze logs first or implement the gateway immediately?</prompt>
    <response>The recommended approach for getting started with Netra is to analyze your historical logs first. This initial, risk-free step allows the platform to provide you with a personalized savings report and a data-driven forecast of the potential ROI. It proves the value of the platform using your own data before you need to make any changes to your production application. Once you have validated the potential savings, the next step is to implement the Optimization Gateway to begin realizing those savings in real-time.</response>
