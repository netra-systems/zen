    <prompt>What are the different pricing plans offered? </prompt>
    <response>Netra offers four main pricing plans: Free, Professional, Premium, and Enterprise. These plans are designed to scale with a company's growth, from individual developers and early-stage startups to large production teams and mature organizations with enterprise-grade needs. </response>

    <prompt>What are the usage limitations of the free or starter plans?</prompt>
    <response>The Free plan has several limitations. It is restricted to a single user and offers only Basic Log Analysis with a limited analysis depth. It does not include API/SDK access, forecasting, or advanced security features. Support is limited to community forums.nnThe Professional plan, which can be considered a starter plan, expands this to 5 users and offers deeper analysis, but it still lacks full API/SDK access, forecasting and alerting, and the enterprise-grade security and compliance features.</response>

    <prompt>Do I need to implement the Gateway to automatically achieve the forecasted cost savings?</prompt>
    <response>Yes, you must implement the Optimization Gateway to automatically achieve the forecasted cost savings. The initial log analysis phase identifies and quantifies potential savings, but the gateway is the mechanism that actively applies the optimizations in real-time to your live traffic, thereby turning the 'Estimated Savings' into 'Realized Savings.'</response>

    <prompt>How does Netra's performance-based pricing model work?</prompt>
    <response>Netra's performance-based pricing model applies to its Premium plan. This plan has a hybrid structure consisting of a fixed monthly fee ($2,500) plus a variable fee calculated as a percentage (2.9%) of the 'managed spend.' 'Managed spend' refers to the LLM costs for the traffic that is actively routed through and optimized by the Netra Optimization Gateway. This model aligns Netra's compensation with the value and scale of the optimization services it provides to the customer.</response>
