SSOT REDIRECTION: Isolated WebSocket Routes Consolidated

 ALERT:  CRITICAL NOTICE: This file now redirects to websocket_ssot.py (isolated mode)

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: All (Free  ->  Enterprise)
- Business Goal: SSOT Compliance & Isolation Security Preservation
- Value Impact: Consolidates isolated route (410 lines) into SSOT while guaranteeing zero event leakage
- Strategic Impact: CRITICAL - Maintains secure multi-user chat through SSOT isolated mode

CONSOLIDATION STATUS:
 PASS:  Original websocket_isolated.py (410 lines)  ->  SSOT websocket_ssot.py (isolated mode)

ISOLATION FEATURES PRESERVED IN SSOT:
 PASS:  Connection-scoped managers - No shared state between users
 PASS:  User authentication validation on ALL connections  
 PASS:  Event filtering - Only events for authenticated user delivered
 PASS:  Automatic resource cleanup on disconnect
 PASS:  Comprehensive audit logging for debugging

REDIRECTION STRATEGY:
All isolation functionality is preserved in websocket_ssot.py isolated mode.
This maintains 100% security guarantees while eliminating SSOT violations.

MIGRATION COMPLETE - DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE DIRECTLY
All changes must be made in websocket_ssot.py to maintain SSOT compliance.

# SSOT COMPLIANCE NOTICE:
# Original websocket_isolated.py contained 410 lines of isolation security logic.
# All functionality has been consolidated into websocket_ssot.py isolated mode to eliminate SSOT violations.
# Zero event leakage and connection-scoped isolation are preserved through mode-based dispatching.
