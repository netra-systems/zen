"""
Environment Context - System-wide environment detection and injection.

This package provides comprehensive environment detection and dependency injection
to eliminate environment defaults that cause Golden Path failures.

ROOT CAUSE RESOLUTION: Addresses the core architectural issue where services
default to EnvironmentType.DEVELOPMENT, causing staging services to connect
to localhost instead of proper staging endpoints.

Key Components:
- CloudEnvironmentDetector: Robust Cloud Run environment detection
- EnvironmentContextService: Dependency injection for environment-aware services  
- Integration patterns for eliminating defaults throughout the system

Business Impact: Prevents $500K+ ARR Golden Path failures by ensuring all
services receive proper environment context instead of localhost defaults.
