"""
Core Managers Package

SSOT (Single Source of Truth) manager implementations consolidating 808+ legacy managers.
These unified managers serve as the central integration points for platform-wide operations.

Manager Hierarchy:
- SystemLifecycle (formerly UnifiedLifecycleManager): All lifecycle operations (startup, shutdown, health monitoring)  
- UnifiedConfigurationManager: All configuration management across services
- UnifiedStateManager: All state management operations

Business Value: Reduces operational complexity from 808 managers to 3 SSOT managers.
Strategic Impact: Eliminates manager sprawl and provides consistent interfaces.

MIGRATION STATUS: 
- UnifiedLifecycleManager  ->  SystemLifecycle (COMPLETED)
- LifecycleManagerFactory  ->  SystemLifecycleFactory (COMPLETED)
- Backward compatibility maintained with deprecation warnings

BUSINESS NAMING CONVENTION: Classes now use business-focused names that clearly indicate their purpose.
