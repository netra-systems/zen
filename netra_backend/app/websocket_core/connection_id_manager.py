Connection ID Manager - SSOT for WebSocket Connection Identity

ISSUE #174 FIX: Creates a single source of truth for WebSocket connection identity
to eliminate dual ID systems that cause state machine conflicts.

Business Impact: $500K+ ARR - Resolves state machine conflicts causing connection failures
Technical Impact: Unifies connection identity throughout WebSocket lifecycle
Architecture: SSOT pattern ensuring single connection identity system

Key Features:
1. Single connection ID throughout WebSocket lifecycle
2. State machine coordination for connection identity
3. Thread-safe connection tracking and cleanup
4. Pass-through connection ID preservation
5. Connection state validation and recovery
