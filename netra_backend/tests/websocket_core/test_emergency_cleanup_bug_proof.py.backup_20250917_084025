Emergency Cleanup Bug Proof - Minimal Reproduction Test

CRITICAL: This test demonstrates the WebSocket Manager emergency cleanup failure
by focusing on the core logic issue: connection tracking doesn't properly handle
cleanup when connections are marked as closed.

This test is designed to FAIL and prove the bug exists.
