"""Redis Graceful Degradation - Critical Failing Tests

Tests that expose Redis dependency failures found in staging logs.
These tests are designed to FAIL to demonstrate current Redis configuration problems.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal  
- Business Goal: Service reliability and graceful degradation
- Value Impact: Ensures backend starts and functions when Redis is unavailable
- Strategic Impact: $9.4M protection - prevents service outages affecting all tiers

Critical Issues from Staging Logs:
1. Backend expects Redis during startup but marked as optional
2. Service crashes when Redis is unavailable instead of graceful degradation
3. Health checks fail when Redis connection is down
4. Configuration loading depends on Redis availability

Expected Behavior (CURRENTLY FAILING):
- Backend should start successfully without Redis
- Health checks should return degraded but not fail completely
- Core functionality should work with in-memory fallbacks
- No crashes or startup failures when Redis is unavailable

Test Strategy:
- Use real service dependencies (no mocks per CLAUDE.md)
- Test actual startup sequence with Redis disabled
- Verify graceful degradation in health endpoints
- Confirm core business logic continues functioning
