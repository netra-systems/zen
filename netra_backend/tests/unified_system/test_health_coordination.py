Multi-Service Health Check Coordination Tests

Comprehensive tests for health check coordination across services.
Business Value: $20K MRR - System monitoring and observability

Tests coordinated health checks across:
- Auth Service (/health endpoint)
- Backend (/health endpoint) 
- Frontend (/health endpoint)
- Database dependencies
- Service interdependencies

Key validations:
- Response times < 500ms
- Service status aggregation
- Dependency health inclusion
- Cross-service consistency
