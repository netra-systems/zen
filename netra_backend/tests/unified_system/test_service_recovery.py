Service Recovery Tests - Critical System Reliability

ðŸ”´ BUSINESS CRITICAL: These tests protect $15K MRR by ensuring automatic service recovery
- Startup failure recovery prevents cascade failures across microservices
- Individual service restart maintains partial system availability  
- Crash detection and recovery minimizes customer-facing downtime
- Recovery mechanisms protect against revenue-impacting outages

BUSINESS VALUE JUSTIFICATION (BVJ):
- Segment: All tiers (Free â†’ Enterprise) - System reliability is universal requirement
- Business Goal: System Resilience & Uptime Maximization
- Value Impact: Prevents $15K MRR loss from prolonged service outages
- Strategic Impact: 99.9% uptime is competitive differentiator vs alternatives

ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE:
- File size: â‰¤500 lines (focused on recovery scenarios)
- Function size: â‰¤8 lines each (MANDATORY)
- Real recovery testing: Uses actual crash recovery manager
- Type safety: Full typing with recovery models
