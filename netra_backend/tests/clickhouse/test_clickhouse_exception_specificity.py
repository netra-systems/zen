ClickHouse Exception Specificity Tests - Issue #374

Tests that demonstrate current broad exception handling problems in ClickHouse modules.
These tests SHOULD FAIL initially to prove the issue exists.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Growth & Enterprise
- Business Goal: Improve analytics reliability and error diagnosis
- Value Impact: Enables data-driven pricing optimization (+$15K MRR)
- Revenue Impact: Prevents analytics downtime that impacts decision making

Test Purpose:
- Demonstrate current broad Exception usage in ClickHouse query execution
- Validate that transaction_errors.py classes SHOULD be used for ClickHouse errors
- Show query execution errors are masked with generic exceptions
- Prove tests would pass with proper specific exception handling

Expected Behavior:
- Tests should FAIL initially due to broad Exception catches
- Tests should demonstrate query failure diagnosis problems
- Clear path to remediation using specific exception types
