"""
ClickHouse Schema Exception Types Tests - Issue #374

Tests that demonstrate current broad exception handling in ClickHouse schema operations.
These tests SHOULD FAIL initially to prove the issue exists.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Growth & Enterprise
- Business Goal: Improve analytics schema reliability and deployment success
- Value Impact: Reduces schema deployment failures and rollback time
- Revenue Impact: Prevents analytics data loss during schema migrations

Test Purpose:
- Demonstrate current broad Exception usage in ClickHouse schema operations
- Validate that specific schema error types SHOULD be used
- Show table creation, migration, and index errors lack specificity
- Prove tests would pass with proper schema-specific exception handling

Expected Behavior:
- Tests should FAIL initially due to broad Exception catches in schema ops
- Tests should demonstrate schema failure diagnosis problems
- Clear path to remediation using specific schema exception types
