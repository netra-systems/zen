"""
ClickHouse Schema Exception Types Tests - Issue #374

Tests that validate proper exception type classification for ClickHouse schema operations.
These tests validate the working exception handling system.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Growth & Enterprise
- Business Goal: Improve analytics schema reliability and deployment success
- Value Impact: Reduces schema deployment failures and rollback time
- Revenue Impact: Prevents analytics data loss during schema migrations

Test Purpose:
- Validate specific schema error type classification in ClickHouse operations
- Confirm proper exception types are available for schema operations
- Verify table creation, migration, and index error specificity
- Test proper schema-specific exception handling implementation

Expected Behavior:
- Tests validate working exception classification system
- Tests confirm specific schema error types are available
- Clear validation of proper schema exception handling
