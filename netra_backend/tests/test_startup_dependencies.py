"""Startup Dependencies - Critical Failing Tests

Tests that expose startup dependency failures found in staging logs.
These tests are designed to FAIL to demonstrate current initialization problems.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Service reliability and startup robustness
- Value Impact: Ensures backend starts correctly with proper dependency order
- Strategic Impact: $9.4M protection - prevents startup failures in production

Critical Issues from Staging Logs:
1. Database optimization fails when async engine is not available
2. Service initialization order causes dependency conflicts
3. Graceful shutdown fails with socket errors
4. Services start without proper dependency waiting mechanisms

Expected Behavior (CURRENTLY FAILING):
- Database should initialize before services that depend on it
- Async engines should be available during optimization
- Services should wait for dependencies before starting
- Graceful shutdown should close connections cleanly

Test Strategy:
- Use real service initialization (no mocks per CLAUDE.md)
- Test actual startup sequence timing and dependencies
- Verify proper dependency ordering
- Confirm graceful shutdown behavior
