Security Demonstration Tests for UserExecutionContext

This module demonstrates how UserExecutionContext prevents common security 
vulnerabilities related to placeholder values and improper context initialization.

These tests show real-world scenarios where invalid context could lead to 
data leakage between users or system failures.
