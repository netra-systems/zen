"""
Database Manager Exception Handling Tests - Issue #374

Tests that demonstrate current broad exception handling problems in DatabaseManager.
These tests SHOULD FAIL initially to prove the issue exists.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/All Users
- Business Goal: Improve error diagnosis and system reliability  
- Value Impact: Reduces debugging time from hours to minutes for database failures
- Revenue Impact: Prevents $500K+ ARR loss from undiagnosed database outages

Test Purpose:
- Demonstrate current broad Exception usage instead of specific types
- Validate that transaction_errors.py classes SHOULD be used
- Show insufficient error context for effective debugging
- Prove tests would pass with proper specific exception handling

Expected Behavior:
- Tests should FAIL initially with broad Exception catches
- Tests should demonstrate problems with current exception handling
- Clear path to remediation using transaction_errors.py classes
