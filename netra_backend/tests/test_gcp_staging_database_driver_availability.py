GCP Staging Database Driver Availability Tests
Failing tests that replicate database driver availability issues found in staging logs

These tests WILL FAIL until the underlying driver availability issues are resolved.
Purpose: Demonstrate database driver problems and prevent regressions.

Issues replicated:
1. Missing psycopg2 module during deployment
2. Missing asyncpg module for async operations
3. Missing clickhouse-connect driver
4. Driver version compatibility issues
5. Import path problems for drivers
