"""
Database connection pool exhaustion scenario tests.

Tests critical database connection pool exhaustion scenarios that cause service downtime,
preventing massive revenue loss from database connectivity failures.

NOTE: These tests are currently DISABLED as they test an outdated ConnectionPoolManager API
that has been DEPRECATED in favor of DatabaseManager (SSOT compliance). The tests need to be
rewritten to use the current database architecture.
