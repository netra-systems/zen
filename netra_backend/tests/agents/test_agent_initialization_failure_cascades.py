"""
Agent initialization failure cascade tests.

Tests critical agent initialization failures that cause cascading system failures,
preventing Enterprise customer loss due to unreliable agent operations.

NOTE: These tests are currently outdated due to significant evolution in agent architectures.
The current agent implementations (SupervisorAgent, TriageSubAgent, DataSubAgent) have 
complex constructors requiring dependencies like LLMManager, ToolDispatcher, AsyncSession, etc.,
and follow standardized execution patterns which are incompatible with the simple
constructor patterns assumed by these tests.

These tests need to be redesigned to work with the current agent architectures or
replaced with integration-level tests that properly mock/provide the required dependencies.
