Current BusinessExpert Coverage: 0% (Zero coverage critical component)

Critical Business Expert Patterns Tested:
- Business domain expertise initialization and configuration
- Market analysis and competitive intelligence capabilities
- Business model validation and growth strategy consultation
- Risk management and compliance requirement checking
- Expert recommendation generation and business case validation
- Integration with LLM for specialized business knowledge
