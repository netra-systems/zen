"""
GCP Staging Startup Sequence Robustness Tests
Failing tests that replicate startup sequence issues found in staging logs

These tests WILL FAIL until the underlying startup sequence issues are resolved.
Purpose: Demonstrate startup problems and prevent regressions.

Issues replicated:
1. Logger variable scoping errors in robust startup
2. Initialization order dependencies
3. Configuration loading before logger setup
4. Environment detection during startup
5. Service dependency startup failures
6. Circular dependency issues during initialization
