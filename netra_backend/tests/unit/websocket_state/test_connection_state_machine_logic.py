Unit Tests for WebSocket Connection State Machine Core Logic

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal - WebSocket Infrastructure
- Business Goal: Eliminate race conditions enabling reliable chat functionality for $120K+ MRR
- Value Impact: Prevents message loss and connection state confusion during WebSocket setup
- Strategic Impact: Foundation for reliable multi-user agent execution and real-time updates

CRITICAL TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. State transitions must be atomic and thread-safe
2. Race condition scenarios must be tested extensively  
3. Message queuing coordination must work correctly
4. State rollback on failures must be validated
5. Concurrent state access must be handled properly

This test suite validates the WebSocket Connection State Machine business logic:
- ApplicationConnectionState enum and state definitions
- StateTransitionInfo atomic operations
- ConnectionStateMachine thread-safe state management
- State validation and transition rules enforcement
- Error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Performance metrics and state timing tracking

STATE TRANSITION FLOW TO TEST:
CONNECTING → ACCEPTED → AUTHENTICATED → SERVICES_READY → PROCESSING_READY

RACE CONDITION SCENARIOS TO TEST:
- Concurrent authentication and service initialization
- Multiple state transition attempts
- State rollback during failures
- Message queuing during state transitions
- Thread-safe state access patterns

Following SSOT patterns:
- Uses real ConnectionStateTransition logic (no mocks)
- Imports from websocket_core.connection_state_machine (SSOT)
- Strongly typed with ApplicationConnectionState enum
- Absolute imports only (no relative imports)
- Test categorization with @pytest.mark.unit
