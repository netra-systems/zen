"""
Test Issue #1278 Database Timeout Logic - Simplified Unit Tests

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform
- Business Goal: Validate application timeout logic during infrastructure failures
- Value Impact: Proves timeout handling code is healthy, issue is infrastructure-based
- Strategic Impact: Enables focus on infrastructure remediation vs code fixes
