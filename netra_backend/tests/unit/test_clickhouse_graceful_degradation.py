"""
ClickHouse Connection Graceful Degradation Tests
==============================================

This test suite validates ClickHouse connection handling and graceful degradation
identified in staging environment logs. These tests are designed to FAIL with current
staging behavior and pass once graceful degradation is properly implemented.

IDENTIFIED ISSUE FROM STAGING:
- ClickHouse connection refused errors causing system failures
- System should gracefully degrade when ClickHouse unavailable
- Impact: Non-critical data logging should not prevent core functionality

BVJ (Business Value Justification):
- Segment: All tiers | Goal: System Reliability & Availability | Impact: System resilience
- Prevents ClickHouse outages from cascading to core functionality
- Maintains user experience when non-critical services are unavailable
- Reduces operational complexity and improves system stability

Expected Test Behavior:
- Tests SHOULD FAIL with current ClickHouse connection handling
- Tests SHOULD PASS once graceful degradation is implemented
- System should continue operating without ClickHouse for non-critical features
