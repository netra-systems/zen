"""
Thread Routing Unit Tests Package

This package contains comprehensive unit tests for thread routing functionality
including thread ID validation, message routing logic, and thread-run registry
core operations.

Test files:
- test_thread_id_validation.py: Thread ID format validation and compliance
- test_message_routing_logic.py: Message type routing and payload validation  
- test_thread_run_registry_core.py: Registry CRUD operations and TTL handling

All tests follow SSOT patterns and are designed to actually fail if the
underlying system is broken, providing real validation of thread routing
functionality.
