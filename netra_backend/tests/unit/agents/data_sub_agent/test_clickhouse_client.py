"""
Comprehensive Unit Tests for ClickHouse Client

Tests all ClickHouse client operations including connection management,
query execution, health checks, and error handling.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal  
- Business Goal: Data access reliability and system stability
- Value Impact: Ensures ClickHouse operations work correctly for analytics
- Strategic Impact: Critical for performance monitoring and user insights
