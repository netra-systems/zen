"""Comprehensive Domain Experts Unit Test Suite - 100% Coverage Focus

MISSION-CRITICAL TEST SUITE: Complete validation of Domain Expert SSOT patterns and specialized expertise.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Mid, Enterprise (Primary) + Early (Growth)
- Business Goal: Specialized Domain Expertise & Customer Value Delivery
- Value Impact: Domain Expert reliability = $200K+ ARR through specialized analysis and recommendations
- Strategic Impact: These agents deliver critical business value through:
  * FinanceExpert: TCO analysis and ROI calculations (saves customers 15-25% infrastructure costs)
  * EngineeringExpert: Performance optimization and scalability planning (prevents $100K+ outage costs)
  * BusinessExpert: Strategic analysis and competitive intelligence (drives market positioning)

COVERAGE TARGET: 100% of Domain Expert critical methods and patterns including:
- BaseDomainExpert initialization and configuration (lines 19-46)
- Domain-specific expertise area definitions (lines 34-40)
- ExecutionContext processing and validation (lines 40-56)
- Expert recommendations generation and parsing (lines 78-99)
- Compliance checking and requirement validation (lines 101-120)
- Domain-specific requirement validation logic
- Error handling and edge case management

CRITICAL: Uses REAL services approach with minimal mocks per CLAUDE.md standards.
Only external LLM dependencies are mocked - all internal components tested with real instances.
