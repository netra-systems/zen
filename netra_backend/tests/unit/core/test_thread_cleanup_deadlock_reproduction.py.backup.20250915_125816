"""
Thread Cleanup Deadlock Reproduction Tests - Issue #601

These tests reproduce the exact deadlock condition identified in the ThreadCleanupManager
where nested lock acquisition in force_cleanup_all() causes deadlocks.

CRITICAL DEADLOCK PATTERN:
1. force_cleanup_all() acquires _cleanup_lock (line 306)
2. force_cleanup_all() calls cleanup_thread_locals() (line 313)
3. cleanup_thread_locals() tries to acquire _cleanup_lock again (line 129)
4. Result: Deadlock when multiple threads call force_cleanup_all() concurrently

Test Strategy:
- Simulate concurrent force_cleanup_all() calls
- Test nested lock acquisition patterns
- Use reasonable timeouts to avoid infinite CI hangs
- Clearly demonstrate deadlock before fixes are applied
