"""
Test CreditManager SSOT Class - Comprehensive Coverage

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise) - credit management affects all user tiers
- Business Goal: Revenue Protection & Credit System Integrity
- Value Impact: Prevents credit calculation errors, protects against credit fraud, ensures accurate billing
- Strategic Impact: $2M+ annual revenue protection through proper credit management and transaction tracking

CRITICAL TESTING COMPLIANCE:
- NO CHEATING ON TESTS = ABOMINATION - All tests fail hard when system breaks
- NO MOCKS for business logic - Use real CreditManager instances
- ABSOLUTE IMPORTS ONLY - No relative imports
- ERROR RAISING - No try/except masking failures
- REAL BUSINESS VALUE - Each test validates actual business logic
