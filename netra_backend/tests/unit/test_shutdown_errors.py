"""
Test-Driven Correction (TDC) tests for shutdown process errors.

These tests are designed to FAIL with the current implementation, exposing three specific bugs:
1. ExecutionMonitor missing stop_monitoring method
2. AsyncIO CancelledError during shutdown not properly handled  
3. RuntimeError with async generator cleanup during shutdown

These tests will pass once the bugs are fixed.
