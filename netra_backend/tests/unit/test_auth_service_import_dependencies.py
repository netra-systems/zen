Test Auth Service Import Dependencies - Issue #1278 Reproduction

MISSION: Create FAILING tests that reproduce the exact ImportError:
"No module named 'auth_service'" from Issue #1278.

These tests are DESIGNED TO FAIL initially to demonstrate the
infrastructure problems affecting the staging deployment.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Infrastructure
- Business Goal: Stability
- Value Impact: Reproduce import failures to validate infrastructure issues
- Strategic Impact: Prove test effectiveness by failing initially

CRITICAL: These tests MUST FAIL initially to reproduce Issue #1278 problems.
