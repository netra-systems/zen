CRITICAL ID FORMAT MIXING FAILURE TESTS

These tests are DESIGNED TO FAIL and expose the critical problems with our
dual ID approach: uuid.uuid4() vs UnifiedIDManager.

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: Platform/Internal  
- Business Goal: System Reliability
- Value Impact: Prevents type confusion bugs in production
- Strategic Impact: Foundation for proper multi-user isolation

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: ALL TESTS SHOULD FAIL INITIALLY
This demonstrates the scope of the ID system problems that need remediation.
