LEGACY UUID VALIDATION BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS GAPS

These tests expose critical gaps where the legacy uuid.uuid4() approach
fundamentally cannot meet business requirements for audit trails,
traceability, and compliance.

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: Platform/Internal + Compliance
- Business Goal: Regulatory Compliance & System Reliability
- Value Impact: Prevents compliance failures, enables audit trails
- Strategic Impact: Foundation for enterprise-grade ID management

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: ALL TESTS SHOULD FAIL INITIALLY
This demonstrates that uuid.uuid4() approach is inadequate for business needs.
