Unit tests for WebSocket import resolution issues - DESIGNED TO FAIL

Business Value:
- Reproduces critical import scope bug: 'get_connection_state_machine' is not defined
- Validates proper import ordering in websocket.py module
- Ensures function-scoped imports don't break call sites

CRITICAL: These tests are DESIGNED TO FAIL to reproduce the exact issue:
"name 'get_connection_state_machine' is not defined" on websocket.py line 1214

The bug occurs when get_connection_state_machine() is called at line 1179 but the import
is at line 1427 inside a function, creating import scope issues.
