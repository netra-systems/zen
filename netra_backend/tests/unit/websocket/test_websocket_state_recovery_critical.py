"""
WebSocket state recovery critical tests.

Tests WebSocket connection recovery scenarios that prevent revenue loss 
from real-time feature failures causing user abandonment.

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: These tests were written for a stateful WebSocket interface
that included connection state persistence and automatic reconnection handling.
The current WebSocketManager implementation uses a different architecture focused
on user-centric connections with WebSocket instances rather than abstract
connection IDs with persistent state.

The tested functionality (state recovery, message queuing during disconnection,
and automatic reconnection) may need to be implemented at a higher level
or through different mechanisms in the current architecture.
