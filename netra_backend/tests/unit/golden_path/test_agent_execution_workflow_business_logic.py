"""
Golden Path Unit Tests: Agent Execution Workflow Business Logic

Tests the core agent execution workflow business logic that orchestrates
AI agent processing in the golden path, with mocked LLM responses to
test business logic without external LLM dependencies.

Business Value:
- Validates agent workflow orchestration for cost analysis scenarios
- Tests agent state management and execution order (Data → Optimization → Reporting)
- Verifies agent communication and result aggregation business logic
- Tests agent error handling and recovery workflows
