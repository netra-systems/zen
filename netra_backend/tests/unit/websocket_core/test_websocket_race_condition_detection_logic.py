"""
WebSocket Race Condition Detection Logic Unit Tests

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal  
- Business Goal: Ensure race condition detection logic works correctly
- Value Impact: Fast feedback on core timing logic without infrastructure overhead
- Strategic/Revenue Impact: Foundation for all race condition prevention protecting $500K+ ARR

ROOT CAUSE ADDRESSED:
- Missing environment-aware WebSocket handshake validation and timing controls for Cloud Run environments
- Problem: "Need to call accept first" errors due to message handling starting before handshake completion
- Solution: Validates timing logic that prevents race conditions in production

CRITICAL TESTING FOCUS:
1. Handshake completion validation logic
2. Progressive delay calculation accuracy  
3. Race condition pattern detection
4. Connection state transition validation
5. Environment-specific timing rules

This unit test validates the core logic components without requiring Docker infrastructure,
enabling fast feedback during development of race condition fixes.
