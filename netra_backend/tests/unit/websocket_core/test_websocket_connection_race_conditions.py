WebSocket Connection Race Condition Tests - Unit Test Level

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: System Stability & Risk Reduction
- Value Impact: Prevent critical WebSocket race condition causing $120K+ MRR chat functionality failures
- Strategic Impact: Reproduce "Need to call 'accept' first" errors identified in staging environment

These tests MUST INITIALLY FAIL to prove the race condition bug exists in the system.
After system remediation, these tests will pass to validate the fix.

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Architecture mismatch between WebSocket acceptance and message processing readiness.
The system lacks proper application-level connection state machine that distinguishes:
1. WebSocket accepted (transport ready)
2. Authentication complete (security ready)  
3. Services initialized (business logic ready)
4. Message processing ready (fully operational)

This test suite implements controlled race condition scenarios to reproduce the exact
staging environment errors documented in STAGING_AUDIT_LOOP_SESSION_20250908.md
