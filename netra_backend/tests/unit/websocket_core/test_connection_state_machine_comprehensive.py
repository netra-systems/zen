"""
Comprehensive Unit Tests for WebSocket ConnectionStateMachine

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Stability & Risk Reduction for $500K+ ARR WebSocket Infrastructure
- Value Impact: Protect critical WebSocket race condition fixes that enable chat-based AI value delivery
- Strategic Impact: Prevent regression of "every 3 minutes staging failure" that blocks user interactions

CRITICAL TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Tests MUST FAIL on old broken implementation (without proper state separation)
2. Tests MUST PASS on new implementation with ApplicationConnectionState management
3. Cover ALL race condition scenarios that caused production failures
4. Validate thread safety and concurrent access patterns
5. Ensure integration with existing is_websocket_connected_and_ready() function

ROOT CAUSE ADDRESSED: 
The system previously conflated "WebSocket accepted" (transport ready) with "ready to process messages" 
(fully operational). This state machine enforces proper separation and prevents race conditions.
