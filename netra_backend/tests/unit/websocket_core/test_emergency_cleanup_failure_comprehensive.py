"""
Emergency Cleanup Failure Bug Proof - Comprehensive Unit Tests

This test file proves the existence of the WebSocket Manager Emergency Cleanup Failure bug.
These tests are designed to FAIL to demonstrate that the emergency cleanup system is not
working correctly when users hit the MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_USER limit.

Business Value:
- Protects $500K+ ARR dependent on reliable WebSocket chat functionality
- Validates emergency cleanup mechanisms that prevent resource exhaustion
- Ensures Golden Path user flow continues when cleanup fails
- Tests core failure patterns that impact business operations

BUG DESCRIPTION:
The WebSocket Manager emergency cleanup system fails to properly remove closed/zombie
connections when users hit the 20-manager limit, leading to:
1. Users being permanently blocked from new connections
2. "HARD LIMIT: User still over limit after cleanup (20/20)" errors
3. Resource exhaustion that cascades to other users
4. System degradation affecting the Golden Path user experience
