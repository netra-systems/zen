"""SSOT WebSocket Broadcast Consolidation Unit Tests - Issue #1058

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Enterprise/Platform (HIPAA, SOC2, SEC compliance)
- Business Goal: Multi-user isolation and Golden Path reliability
- Value Impact: Prevents $500K+ ARR loss from cross-user event leakage
- Strategic Impact: Enables secure multi-tenant platform architecture

Tests SSOT consolidation of duplicate broadcast_to_user implementations:
1. WebSocketEventRouter.broadcast_to_user() (legacy singleton)
2. UserScopedWebSocketEventRouter.broadcast_to_user() (user-scoped)
3. broadcast_user_event() (convenience function)

CRITICAL MISSION: These tests MUST FAIL until proper SSOT implementation consolidates
the three duplicate broadcast functions into WebSocketBroadcastService.

Test Strategy: Validates SSOT consolidation benefits including singleton enforcement,
performance improvements, and connection pool consolidation vs legacy implementations.
