"""
Test ClickHouse infrastructure edge cases and deployment scenarios.

These tests cover additional ClickHouse-related issues in staging:
1. Certificate validation failures for HTTPS connections
2. Database existence validation on staging infrastructure  
3. Query timeout handling with staging-specific timeouts

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Analytics Reliability - Handle ClickHouse edge case scenarios  
- Value Impact: Prevents analytics pipeline failures from infrastructure edge cases
- Strategic Impact: Ensures ClickHouse reliability across deployment environments
