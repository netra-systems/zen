"""
Test ClickHouse connection failures observed in staging environment.

These tests replicate critical ClickHouse infrastructure issues identified in staging logs:
1. Connection timeout to clickhouse.staging.netrasystems.ai:8443
2. SSL/TLS handshake failures on HTTPS port 8443
3. Missing ClickHouse infrastructure in staging environment

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal 
- Business Goal: System Stability - Prevent ClickHouse connection failures
- Value Impact: Eliminates analytics service failures that impact data-driven features
- Strategic Impact: Ensures reliable data pipeline and analytics functionality
