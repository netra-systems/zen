### WebSocket Event Validation

All tests validate the 5 critical WebSocket events:

4. `tool_completed` - Tool execution results
5. `agent_completed` - Agent execution finished

Event validation ensures:
- All expected events are sent
- Events are in correct order
- Event data is properly structured
- User isolation is maintained in events
