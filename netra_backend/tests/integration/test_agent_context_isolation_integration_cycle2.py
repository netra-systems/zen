"""
Integration Tests for Agent Context Isolation - Cycle 2

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
- Business Goal: Ensure complete user isolation in multi-tenant agent execution
- Value Impact: Prevents data leakage between concurrent users, enabling enterprise trust
- Strategic Impact: Context isolation is critical for scaling to enterprise customers

CRITICAL: Multi-user context isolation enables the chat business value by allowing
multiple users to interact with agents simultaneously without data contamination.
Without proper isolation, enterprise customers would not trust the platform.
