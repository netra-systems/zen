"""Cold Startup Readiness Detection Integration Tests (L3)

Tests that the system properly indicates readiness during the cold startup sequence.
This test exposes a gap where the health endpoint doesn't check application startup completion.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal (enabling all segments)
- Business Goal: Ensure system properly signals readiness to load balancers and orchestrators
- Value Impact: Prevents premature traffic routing to unready instances during cold starts
- Revenue Impact: Critical - premature traffic routing causes user-facing errors and service outages
