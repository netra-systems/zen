RED TEAM TEST 67: Multi-User Organization Management

DESIGNED TO FAIL: This test exposes real vulnerabilities in multi-tenant
organization management, user isolation, and administrative privilege controls.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Mid, Enterprise (Multi-user accounts)
- Business Goal: Enterprise Sales, Data Security, Compliance
- Value Impact: Organization isolation failures cause data breaches and regulatory violations
- Strategic Impact: Enterprise customer trust and $50K+ deal protection

Testing Level: L4 (Real services, multi-tenant validation, cross-organization security)
Expected Initial Result: FAILURE (exposes organization isolation gaps)
