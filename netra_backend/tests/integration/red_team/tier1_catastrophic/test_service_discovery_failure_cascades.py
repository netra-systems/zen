RED TEAM TEST 8: Service Discovery Failure Cascades

DESIGN TO FAIL: This test is DESIGNED to FAIL initially to validate:
1. What happens when auth service goes down
2. Cascading failures across dependent services
3. Proper health check propagation

These tests use real services and will expose actual service discovery issues.
