## FINAL CRITICAL GAPS - Core API, Data Operations, and Notifications

This tier contains the final 20 tests completing the comprehensive RED TEAM TEST PLAN, focusing on:

### Core API Operations (Tests 81-90)
- **Test 81**: API Rate Limiting Per Subscription Tier
- **Test 82**: API Response Data Consistency  
- **Test 83**: API Error Handling and Client Recovery
- **Test 84**: Multi-Tenant Data Segregation
- **Test 85**: Database Connection Pool Management
- **Test 86**: Data Export and Import Pipeline
- **Test 87**: Search and Filtering Performance
- **Test 88**: Data Backup and Recovery Procedures
- **Test 89**: API Versioning and Deprecation Management
- **Test 90**: Data Validation and Sanitization

### Communication and Notifications (Tests 91-100)
- **Test 91**: Email Delivery Reliability
- **Test 92**: Real-time Notification Delivery
- **Test 93**: Notification Preference Management

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)

**Segment**: All tiers (Platform-wide operational excellence)
**Business Goal**: System reliability, data integrity, customer experience
**Value Impact**: Ensures platform stability, data security, and reliable customer communications
**Strategic Impact**: Customer retention, compliance, operational efficiency, technical debt reduction

## DESIGNED TO FAIL

These tests are **DESIGNED TO FAIL** initially to expose real gaps in:
- API reliability and consistency across tiers
- Data operations integrity and security
- Communication system reliability
- End-to-end operational monitoring
- System resilience and error handling

## Critical Operational Risks

1. **API Inconsistencies**: Rate limiting, versioning, error handling gaps
2. **Data Integrity**: Export/import, backup/recovery, validation failures  
3. **Communication Failures**: Email delivery, notifications, webhook reliability
4. **Monitoring Gaps**: Health checks, alerting, dead letter queue processing
5. **Performance Issues**: Search, filtering, connection pool exhaustion

## Test Structure

Each test validates real operational scenarios that could impact:
- Customer experience and satisfaction
- Data security and compliance
- System stability and performance
- Revenue protection and business continuity
- Technical debt and maintenance burden
