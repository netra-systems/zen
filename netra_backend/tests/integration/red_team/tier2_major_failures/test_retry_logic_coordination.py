RED TEAM TEST 23: Retry Logic Coordination

CRITICAL: This test is DESIGNED TO FAIL initially to expose real integration issues.
Tests retry mechanisms coordination across services and failure scenarios.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
- Business Goal: Platform Reliability, User Experience, System Resilience
- Value Impact: Poor retry coordination causes cascading failures and poor UX
- Strategic Impact: Core resilience foundation for reliable AI platform operations

Testing Level: L3 (Real services, real retries, minimal mocking)
Expected Initial Result: FAILURE (exposes real retry coordination gaps)
