### Disaster Recovery (test 65)
- **Test 65**: Subscription State Recovery After System Failure - Business continuity and disaster recovery

## Test Design Philosophy

All tests are **DESIGNED TO FAIL** initially, implementing the "Red Team" approach:

1. **Force Implementation**: Tests fail until robust business logic is implemented
2. **Identify Business Risks**: Each test highlights specific revenue or compliance risks
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover edge cases and complex business scenarios
4. **Business Value Focus**: Every test includes explicit Business Value Justification (BVJ)

## Business Value Justification

### Revenue Protection
- Prevents revenue leakage from billing errors
- Ensures accurate usage-based billing
- Protects against subscription state corruption

### Customer Retention
- Handles payment failures gracefully
- Provides smooth tier transitions
- Maintains service quality during issues

### Compliance & Risk
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Tax calculation accuracy
- Audit trail maintenance
- Disaster recovery capabilities

### Business Intelligence
- Revenue analytics and forecasting
- Customer lifetime value tracking
- Churn analysis and prevention

3. **Integration Testing**: Validate services work together correctly
4. **Performance Testing**: Ensure systems can handle production loads
5. **Security Validation**: Implement and test security controls
6. **Disaster Recovery**: Build and test recovery procedures

## Success Criteria

Tests will pass when:
- All subscription management services are implemented
- Billing calculations are accurate and compliant
