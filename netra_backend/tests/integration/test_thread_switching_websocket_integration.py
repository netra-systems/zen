"""
WebSocket Thread Switching Integration Tests (Tests 21-40)

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise) 
- Business Goal: Enable seamless thread-based conversations with real-time WebSocket updates
- Value Impact: Users can manage multiple conversation threads with live agent event delivery
- Strategic Impact: Core chat functionality that enables multi-threaded AI conversations

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Tests 21-40 focus specifically on WebSocket thread switching functionality
- Uses ONLY real services - NO MOCKS in integration tests per TEST_CREATION_GUIDE.md
- Follows SSOT patterns from test_framework/ 
- Tests the 5 critical WebSocket events: agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, tool_completed, agent_completed
- Uses proper isolation patterns with UserExecutionContext
- Tests WebSocket room management, event broadcasting, connection handling, and multi-user isolation
- Creates realistic business value tests focusing on WebSocket functionality
- Uses real database operations using real_services_fixture
- Proper WebSocket message validation and event sequences
- Thread-specific WebSocket room isolation
- Multi-user concurrent WebSocket operations

FOCUS AREAS (Tests 21-40):
- Test 21-25: WebSocket room management for threads
- Test 26-30: Thread event broadcasting via WebSocket  
- Test 31-35: WebSocket connection handling during thread switches
- Test 36-40: Multi-user WebSocket thread isolation
