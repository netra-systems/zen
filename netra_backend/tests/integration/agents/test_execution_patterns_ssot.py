"""
Execution Patterns SSOT Integration Test Suite

This test suite focuses on execution pattern SSOT compliance at the integration level.
These tests verify that execution patterns work consistently across different agent types
and that there is truly unified execution infrastructure being used.

CRITICAL: These tests are designed to FAIL in the current state where multiple execution
patterns exist. They will PASS once proper SSOT consolidation is achieved.

Integration Test Focus:
1. Execution engine consistency across agents
2. Execution context handling uniformity
3. Pre/post execution hook consistency
4. Error handling in execution patterns
5. Timing and monitoring integration
6. Execution result handling consistency
