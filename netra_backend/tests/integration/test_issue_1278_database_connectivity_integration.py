Test Database Connectivity Integration for Issue #1278

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform
- Business Goal: Validate database connectivity under infrastructure pressure
- Value Impact: Exposes real connectivity constraints affecting staging environment
- Strategic Impact: Provides data for infrastructure capacity planning
