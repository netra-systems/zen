"""
Error Handling and Fallback Report Integration Tests - Test Suite 6

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise) 
- Business Goal: Ensure users receive value even when primary report generation fails
- Value Impact: Fallback mechanisms prevent user experience degradation during failures
- Strategic Impact: System resilience maintains user trust and prevents churn

CRITICAL: Tests validate that error scenarios are handled gracefully with meaningful
fallback reports, partial results, and clear error communication. Users must never
receive empty responses or unclear error messages.

Golden Path Focus: Error detection  ->  Fallback activation  ->  Partial report generation  ->  User notification
NO MOCKS: Uses real services to test actual failure scenarios and recovery mechanisms
