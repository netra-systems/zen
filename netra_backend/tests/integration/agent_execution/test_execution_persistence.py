"""
Agent Execution Persistence Integration Tests
===========================================

BUSINESS VALUE JUSTIFICATION (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Enterprise ($500K+ ARR customers)
- Business Goal: Stability and reliability of agent execution tracking
- Value Impact: Ensures execution state persistence prevents lost agent work and provides audit trails
- Strategic Impact: Prevents revenue loss from failed agent executions and provides compliance data

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- REAL PostgreSQL database integration (NO MOCKS)
- Test execution state persistence across database operations
- Validate execution lifecycle tracking with real persistence
- Ensure business-critical states are accurately stored and retrieved
- Test multi-user execution isolation at database level
- Validate audit trail generation for compliance needs

This test suite validates that agent execution states are properly persisted
to the database and can survive service restarts, database reconnections,
and concurrent user operations.
