"""
Critical Database Migration State Recovery Tests - Cycles 21-25
Tests revenue-critical migration state recovery and consistency patterns.

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: All customer segments during deployments
- Business Goal: Prevent $1.2M annual revenue loss from failed deployments
- Value Impact: Ensures zero-downtime deployments for continuous service
- Strategic Impact: Enables rapid feature delivery with 99.8% deployment success

Cycles Covered: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25
