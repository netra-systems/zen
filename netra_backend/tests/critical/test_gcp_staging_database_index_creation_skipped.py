"""
Test-Driven Correction (TDC) Tests for Database Index Creation Skipped Issues
Critical staging issue: Async engine not available, skipping index creation

These are FAILING tests that demonstrate the exact database index creation issues
found in GCP staging logs. The tests are intentionally designed to fail to expose
the specific startup timing and race condition problems that need fixing.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Platform Stability - ensure proper database initialization in staging
- Value Impact: Ensures database indexes are created for optimal performance
- Strategic Impact: Critical for staging environment performance and data integrity
