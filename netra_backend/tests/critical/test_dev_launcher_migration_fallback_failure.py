"""
Test-Driven Correction (TDC) Tests for Migration Failure Fallback Issues  
Critical dev launcher issue: Migration failures cause uncontrolled table creation fallback

These are FAILING tests that demonstrate the exact migration fallback issues
found in dev launcher analysis. The tests are intentionally designed to fail to expose
the specific fallback behavior problems that need fixing.

Root Cause: When migrations fail, the system falls back to creating tables directly,
which can lead to inconsistent schema state and bypassing proper migration tracking.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Database Integrity & Development Velocity  
- Value Impact: Ensures predictable database schema evolution and migration tracking
- Strategic Impact: Prevents data corruption and schema inconsistencies across environments
