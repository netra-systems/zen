"""
Test-Driven Correction (TDC) Tests for Database Migration Recovery Patterns
Critical dev launcher issue: Migration 66e0e5d9662d idempotency and recovery failures

These are FAILING tests that demonstrate database recovery and idempotency issues
discovered in migration 66e0e5d9662d analysis. The tests are intentionally designed 
to fail to expose specific database state management problems.

Root Cause Analysis:
1. Migration 66e0e5d9662d has non-idempotent index operations
2. Partial migration states can leave database in inconsistent state
3. Concurrent migrations can cause deadlocks and corruption
4. Cross-database consistency validation is missing

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Database Integrity & Development Velocity
- Value Impact: Ensures reliable database migrations in all environments
- Strategic Impact: Prevents data corruption and reduces deployment risk
