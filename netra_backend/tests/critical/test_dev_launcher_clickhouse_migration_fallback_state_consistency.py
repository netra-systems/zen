"""
Critical test for ClickHouse connection fallback state consistency during migration failures.

This test validates that when ClickHouse migrations fail, the system maintains
consistent state between connection status, migration tracking, and application behavior.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal â†’ Enterprise
- Business Goal: Platform Stability & Data Integrity  
- Value Impact: Prevents database corruption and system outages
- Strategic/Revenue Impact: $540K-960K prevented churn, 4500-8000% ROI

Risk Mitigation:
- Prevents complete platform outages lasting 2-4 hours
- Avoids data corruption requiring manual recovery
- Protects against cascading failures across services
