"""
Test-Driven Correction (TDC) Tests for PostgreSQL Health Check Failures
Critical staging issue: Database health checks failing regularly

These are FAILING tests that demonstrate the exact PostgreSQL health check issues
found in GCP staging logs. The tests are intentionally designed to fail to expose
the specific health check reliability and performance problems that need fixing.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal  
- Business Goal: Platform Stability - reliable health monitoring in staging
- Value Impact: Ensures accurate health status for load balancer and monitoring systems
- Strategic Impact: Critical for staging environment reliability and deployment confidence
