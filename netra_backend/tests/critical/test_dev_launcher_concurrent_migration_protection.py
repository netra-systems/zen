TDC: Concurrent Migration Protection Test

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Prevent database corruption during concurrent deployments
- Value Impact: Ensures data integrity and prevents $50K+ downtime from migration conflicts
- Strategic Impact: Enables safe horizontal scaling and concurrent dev launcher instances

This test validates the migration lock system prevents concurrent migrations from corrupting
database state when multiple dev launcher instances start simultaneously.

Test-Driven Correction (TDC) Requirements:
1. Test concurrent migration attempts through threading simulation
2. Verify only one migration succeeds at a time via PostgreSQL advisory locks
3. Validate database consistency after concurrent operations
4. Ensure proper lock acquisition and release patterns
5. Test migration idempotency and recovery behavior
