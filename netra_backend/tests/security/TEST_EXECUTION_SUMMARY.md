5. **Memory Leak Cross-User References**
   - ❌ **Vulnerability:** Memory references preventing garbage collection
   - 🚨 **Impact:** Users maintain access to other users' data in memory
   - 📋 **Evidence:** Cross-user references detected preventing proper cleanup

6. **State Copy Contamination**
   - ❌ **Vulnerability:** `copy_with_updates()` allows malicious data injection
   - 🚨 **Impact:** Victim user state contaminated with attacker data
   - 📋 **Evidence:** Contamination incidents through update operations
