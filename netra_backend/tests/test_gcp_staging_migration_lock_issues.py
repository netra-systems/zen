"""
GCP Staging Migration Lock Issues - Failing Tests

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal (affects all customer segments)
- Business Goal: Platform Stability and Deployment Reliability
- Value Impact: Prevents database migration failures that block deployments
- Strategic/Revenue Impact: Database schema consistency required for platform operation

These failing tests replicate database migration lock issues found in GCP staging deployment.
The tests are designed to FAIL until the underlying migration lock handling issues are resolved.

Critical Issues Tested:
1. Migration lock acquisition failures during database migrations
2. Concurrent migration attempts causing deadlocks
3. Stale migration locks preventing new deployments
4. Lock timeout handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Alembic migration state consistency issues
