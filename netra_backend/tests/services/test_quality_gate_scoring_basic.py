        Performance Optimization Report:
        
        Current State: The system processes 500 requests per second with 200ms p95 latency.
        GPU utilization sits at 65% with 12GB memory usage.
        
        Proposed Changes:
        1. Enable batch processing with batch_size=32 (currently 8)
        2. Implement KV cache with 2GB allocation
        3. Use INT8 quantization for 50% memory reduction
        
        Implementation:
        ```bash
        pip install optimization-toolkit
        python optimize.py --batch-size 32 --quantize int8
        ```
        
        Expected Results:
        - Throughput: 500 RPS → 1500 RPS (200% increase)
        - Latency: 200ms → 120ms (40% reduction)
        - Memory: 12GB → 6GB (50% reduction)
        - Cost: $1000/month → $600/month
        
        Trade-offs: 0.5% accuracy loss acceptable for 3x performance gain.
