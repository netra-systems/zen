"""Health Endpoint HTTP Methods - Critical Failing Tests

Tests that expose health endpoint method failures found in staging logs.
These tests are designed to FAIL to demonstrate current HTTP method handling problems.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Service reliability and monitoring compatibility  
- Value Impact: Ensures health endpoints work with all monitoring systems
- Strategic Impact: $9.4M protection - prevents monitoring failures in production

Critical Issues from Staging Logs:
1. Health endpoints return 405 (Method Not Allowed) for HEAD requests
2. Load balancers and monitoring systems expect HEAD method support
3. OPTIONS method may not be properly handled for CORS preflight
4. Inconsistent HTTP method support across health endpoints

Expected Behavior (CURRENTLY FAILING):
- GET /health should return 200 with health status
- HEAD /health should return 200 with same headers but no body
- OPTIONS /health should return 200 with allowed methods
- All methods should have consistent status codes and headers

Test Strategy:
- Use real HTTP requests (no mocks per CLAUDE.md)
- Test actual FastAPI endpoint method handling
- Verify HTTP specification compliance
- Confirm monitoring system compatibility
