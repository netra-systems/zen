# Distributed Tracing in AI: Engineering Observability Across Complex AI Pipelines

## The Observability Crisis in Distributed AI Systems

Modern AI systems span dozens of services, multiple models, and distributed infrastructure where a single inference request touches 50+ components, making traditional monitoring blind to 90% of actual behavior. Without distributed tracing, organizations spend 73% of incident response time just understanding what happened, while performance bottlenecks hide in the interactions between services. Companies implementing comprehensive distributed tracing for AI report 85% reduction in mean time to resolution, 60% improvement in system performance, and 70% decrease in unexplained failures.
