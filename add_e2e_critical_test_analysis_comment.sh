## E2E Critical Test Analysis Update

### Current Test State
- **Test Category:** E2E Critical (auth_jwt_critical, service_health_critical)
- **Environment:** GCP Staging
- **Status:** BLOCKED by database connectivity issues

### Test Failures Root Cause
1. **Primary Issue:** Database connection timeouts on staging environment
2. **Impact:** All e2e tests requiring real services fail immediately
3. **Affected Tests:**
   - test_auth_jwt_critical.py - Cannot authenticate due to DB timeouts
   - test_service_health_critical.py - Health checks fail with 503 errors

### Evidence from Test Infrastructure
- Backend health endpoint returning HTTP 503 
- PostgreSQL connection failures with timeout errors
- Redis connectivity issues on staging
- WebSocket authentication chain broken due to auth service DB dependency

### Business Impact
- Golden Path completely blocked (users cannot login or get AI responses)
- $500K+ ARR functionality non-functional
- Critical e2e test suite cannot validate fixes

### Next Steps Required
1. Immediate: Resolve database connectivity infrastructure issue
2. Then: Re-run e2e critical test suite to validate fixes
3. Finally: Ensure all critical paths are tested and passing
