# Archived Migration Scripts

This directory contains migration scripts that have completed their purpose and are no longer needed for active development.

## WebSocket V2 to V3 Migration Scripts (Archived 2025-09-12)

### migrate_websocket_v2_critical_services.py
- **Purpose**: Migrated critical services from deprecated singleton `get_websocket_manager()` to factory pattern
- **Status**: Migration completed, script obsolete
- **Business Impact**: Protected $500K+ ARR by eliminating WebSocket isolation vulnerabilities

### migrate_websocket_to_unified.py
- **Purpose**: Updated legacy WebSocket references to unified SSOT implementation
- **Status**: Consolidation completed, reduced codebase by 13+ files
- **Business Impact**: Simplified maintenance and eliminated SSOT violations

## Archival Rationale

These scripts were archived as part of the final V2 legacy cleanup (Issue #447) because:

1. **Core V2 → V3 migration is complete** - All production systems are using V3 patterns
2. **SSOT consolidation achieved** - WebSocket routes consolidated from 4 competing implementations
3. **Business functionality preserved** - Golden Path user flow remains fully operational
4. **V3 validation successful** - All mission-critical tests passing with V3 patterns

## Recovery

If these scripts are needed for reference:
1. They remain in git history
2. This archived directory preserves them for analysis
3. The patterns can be recreated from the working V3 implementation

**Status**: ✅ V2 Legacy Cleanup Complete
**Date**: 2025-09-12
