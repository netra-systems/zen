## 🔧 ROLLBACK EXECUTION PROCEDURES

### **Procedure 1: Single Commit Rollback (Most Common)**

#### Use Case:
- Last atomic commit caused regression
- Issue isolated to most recent change
- Quick fix needed to restore functionality

#### Steps:
```bash
# Step 1: Immediate safety check
echo "🚨 EMERGENCY ROLLBACK - Single Commit"
cd C:\netra-apex

# Step 2: Verify current problematic state
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Golden Path is working - rollback may not be needed"
    echo "💡 Run diagnostics first: python scripts/ssot_remediation/validation_suite.py phase2"
    exit 1
fi

# Step 3: Capture current state for analysis
git log --oneline -5 > rollback_context_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt
python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py > compliance_before_rollback_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt

# Step 4: Execute rollback
echo "🔄 Rolling back last commit..."
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Step 5: Immediate validation
echo "✅ Validating rollback success..."
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py || {
    echo "🚨 CRITICAL: Rollback did not restore Golden Path"
    echo "🚨 ESCALATE TO TEAM IMMEDIATELY"
    exit 1
}

# Step 6: Comprehensive validation
python scripts/ssot_remediation/validation_suite.py phase1 golden_path compliance_score production_integrity

# Step 7: Document rollback
echo "📝 Documenting rollback..."
echo "$(date): Single commit rollback executed due to regression" >> reports/ssot_remediation/rollback_log.txt
git log --oneline -1 >> reports/ssot_remediation/rollback_log.txt

echo "✅ Single commit rollback completed successfully"
```

#### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] Golden Path WebSocket events working
- [ ] Production systems maintain 100% compliance
- [ ] Compliance score restored to baseline
- [ ] No new test failures introduced
- [ ] Rollback documented in rollback log

---

### **Procedure 2: Phase Rollback (Moderate Impact)**

#### Use Case:
- Multiple commits in current phase causing issues
- Need to rollback entire remediation phase
- Systematic issues affecting multiple components

#### Steps:
```bash
# Step 1: Emergency assessment
echo "🚨 EMERGENCY ROLLBACK - Full Phase"
cd C:\netra-apex

# Step 2: Identify phase boundaries
echo "🔍 Identifying rollback target..."
git log --oneline --grep="SSOT" -10

# Manual identification required - find last commit before phase started
read -p "Enter commit hash to rollback to (pre-phase): " TARGET_COMMIT

# Step 3: Validate target commit
git show $TARGET_COMMIT --name-only | head -10
read -p "Confirm this is the correct rollback target (y/N): " CONFIRM

if [ "$CONFIRM" != "y" ]; then
    echo "❌ Rollback cancelled - verify target commit"
    exit 1
fi

# Step 4: Capture current state for post-mortem
mkdir -p reports/ssot_remediation/rollbacks/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
ROLLBACK_DIR="reports/ssot_remediation/rollbacks/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"

git log --oneline HEAD...$TARGET_COMMIT > $ROLLBACK_DIR/commits_being_rolled_back.txt
python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py > $ROLLBACK_DIR/compliance_before_rollback.txt
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --categories mission_critical --dry-run > $ROLLBACK_DIR/test_state_before_rollback.txt

# Step 5: Execute phase rollback
echo "🔄 Rolling back to $TARGET_COMMIT..."
git reset --hard $TARGET_COMMIT

# Step 6: Immediate Golden Path validation
echo "✅ Validating rollback success..."
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py || {
    echo "🚨 CRITICAL: Phase rollback did not restore Golden Path"
    echo "🚨 SYSTEM MAY BE IN UNSTABLE STATE"
    echo "🚨 ESCALATE TO SENIOR TEAM IMMEDIATELY"
    exit 1
}

# Step 7: Comprehensive validation
python scripts/ssot_remediation/validation_suite.py phase1

# Step 8: Capture post-rollback state
python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py > $ROLLBACK_DIR/compliance_after_rollback.txt
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --categories mission_critical integration > $ROLLBACK_DIR/test_results_after_rollback.txt

# Step 9: Document and analyze
echo "$(date): Phase rollback executed to $TARGET_COMMIT" >> reports/ssot_remediation/rollback_log.txt
echo "Reason: [MANUAL INPUT REQUIRED]" >> reports/ssot_remediation/rollback_log.txt
echo "Analysis required in: $ROLLBACK_DIR" >> reports/ssot_remediation/rollback_log.txt

echo "✅ Phase rollback completed successfully"
echo "📋 Next steps:"
echo "   1. Analyze rollback artifacts in $ROLLBACK_DIR"
echo "   2. Conduct post-mortem analysis"
echo "   3. Revise remediation approach"
echo "   4. Update team on status"
```

#### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] Golden Path functionality fully restored
- [ ] All production systems operational
- [ ] Compliance score returned to pre-phase baseline
- [ ] Test infrastructure stability confirmed
- [ ] Post-mortem artifacts captured for analysis

---

### **Procedure 3: Emergency System Restore (Highest Impact)**

#### Use Case:
- System-wide instability
- Multiple components affected
- Production functionality at risk
- Need to restore to last known good state

#### Steps:
```bash
# Step 1: CRITICAL system assessment
echo "🚨 EMERGENCY SYSTEM RESTORE"
echo "🚨 This procedure restores to last known good state"
echo "🚨 All recent SSOT remediation work will be lost"

cd C:\netra-apex

# Step 2: Confirm emergency authorization
read -p "CONFIRM: Production system emergency? (type 'EMERGENCY' to continue): " AUTH
if [ "$AUTH" != "EMERGENCY" ]; then
    echo "❌ Emergency restore cancelled"
    exit 1
fi

# Step 3: Identify last known good state
# Look for baseline tag or commit from Phase 1
git tag | grep baseline || echo "No baseline tag found"
git log --oneline --grep="baseline" -5

# Default to last commit before any SSOT remediation
BASELINE_COMMIT=$(git log --oneline --grep="SSOT remediation baseline" -1 --format="%H")

if [ -z "$BASELINE_COMMIT" ]; then
    echo "⚠️ No automatic baseline found"
    echo "📋 Recent commits:"
    git log --oneline -10
    read -p "Enter baseline commit hash: " BASELINE_COMMIT
fi

# Step 4: Execute emergency restore
echo "🔄 EMERGENCY RESTORE to $BASELINE_COMMIT"

# Capture current state for forensics
mkdir -p reports/emergency_restore/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
RESTORE_DIR="reports/emergency_restore/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"

git log --oneline HEAD...$BASELINE_COMMIT > $RESTORE_DIR/lost_commits.txt
git diff HEAD $BASELINE_COMMIT > $RESTORE_DIR/lost_changes.diff

# Execute restore
git reset --hard $BASELINE_COMMIT

# Step 5: Immediate system validation
echo "✅ Validating emergency restore..."

# Golden Path validation
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py || {
    echo "🚨 CRITICAL: Emergency restore failed to restore Golden Path"
    echo "🚨 SYSTEM REQUIRES MANUAL INTERVENTION"
    echo "🚨 CONTACT SENIOR ENGINEERS IMMEDIATELY"
    exit 1
}

# Production system validation
python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py --production-only | grep "100.0% compliant" || {
    echo "⚠️ WARNING: Production compliance not at 100%"
    echo "📋 This may be expected - verify baseline state"
}

# Step 6: Comprehensive system check
python scripts/ssot_remediation/validation_suite.py full

# Step 7: Emergency documentation
echo "$(date): EMERGENCY SYSTEM RESTORE executed" >> reports/ssot_remediation/rollback_log.txt
echo "Restored to: $BASELINE_COMMIT" >> reports/ssot_remediation/rollback_log.txt
echo "Forensic data: $RESTORE_DIR" >> reports/ssot_remediation/rollback_log.txt

echo "✅ Emergency restore completed"
echo "🚨 REQUIRED ACTIONS:"
echo "   1. Notify all team members of restore"
echo "   2. Conduct emergency post-mortem"
echo "   3. Analyze forensic data in $RESTORE_DIR"
echo "   4. Revise entire remediation strategy"
echo "   5. Implement additional safeguards"
```

#### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Golden Path fully operational
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Production systems stable
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Chat functionality working
- [ ] Authentication system operational
- [ ] Database connectivity confirmed
- [ ] Emergency documented with forensic data

## 🛡️ RISK MITIGATION PROTOCOLS

### **Protocol 1: Pre-Commit Safety Checks**

#### Automated Safety Gate:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: scripts/ssot_remediation/pre_commit_safety_gate.sh

echo "🛡️ SSOT Remediation Pre-Commit Safety Gate"

# 1. Golden Path validation (CRITICAL)
echo "⏳ Validating Golden Path..."
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py || {
    echo "🚨 COMMIT BLOCKED: Golden Path compromised"
    echo "💡 Fix Golden Path issues before committing"
    exit 1
}

# 2. Production compliance check (CRITICAL)
echo "⏳ Checking production compliance..."
python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py --production-only | grep "100.0% compliant" || {
    echo "🚨 COMMIT BLOCKED: Production compliance compromised"
    echo "💡 Restore production system integrity before committing"
    exit 1
}

# 3. Compliance regression check (HIGH)
echo "⏳ Checking compliance regression..."
CURRENT_SCORE=$(python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py | grep "Compliance Score" | grep -o "[0-9]*\.[0-9]*")
BASELINE_SCORE=$(cat reports/ssot_remediation/baseline_compliance_score.txt 2>/dev/null || echo "98.0")

if (( $(echo "$CURRENT_SCORE < $BASELINE_SCORE - 2.0" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "🚨 COMMIT BLOCKED: Compliance regression > 2%"
    echo "💡 Current: $CURRENT_SCORE%, Baseline: $BASELINE_SCORE%"
    exit 1
fi

# 4. Critical test validation (HIGH)
echo "⏳ Running critical tests..."
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --categories mission_critical --fast-fail --timeout 300 || {
    echo "🚨 COMMIT BLOCKED: Critical tests failing"
    echo "💡 Fix critical test failures before committing"
    exit 1
}

echo "✅ Pre-commit safety gate passed - safe to commit"
```

### **Protocol 2: Continuous Monitoring During Remediation**

#### Real-time Monitoring Script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: scripts/ssot_remediation/continuous_monitor.sh

echo "📊 Starting SSOT Remediation Continuous Monitoring"

while true; do
    sleep 300  # Check every 5 minutes

    echo "$(date): Running compliance check..."

    # Capture current metrics
    python scripts/ssot_remediation/monitoring_and_tracking.py snapshot "continuous_monitoring"

    # Check for alerts
    ALERTS=$(python scripts/ssot_remediation/monitoring_and_tracking.py check-alerts)

    if echo "$ALERTS" | grep -q "REGRESSION ALERTS DETECTED"; then
        echo "🚨 REGRESSION DETECTED - Sending alerts"
        echo "$ALERTS" | mail -s "SSOT Remediation Regression Alert" team@company.com

        # Check if critical alert requires immediate action
        if echo "$ALERTS" | grep -q "golden_path_failure"; then
            echo "🚨 CRITICAL: Golden Path failure detected"
            echo "🚨 Consider immediate rollback"
            # Could trigger automated rollback in future
        fi
    fi

    echo "$(date): Monitoring cycle complete"
done
```

### **Protocol 3: Staged Rollback Approach**

#### Minimal Impact Rollback Strategy:
1. **Stage 1:** Revert only breaking change (single commit)
2. **Stage 2:** Revert related changes (commit group)
3. **Stage 3:** Revert entire phase if needed
4. **Stage 4:** Emergency system restore as last resort

#### Implementation:
```bash
# Stage 1: Single commit revert
git revert HEAD --no-edit
python scripts/ssot_remediation/validation_suite.py phase2 golden_path

# If Stage 1 insufficient:
# Stage 2: Multiple commit revert
git revert HEAD~3..HEAD --no-edit
python scripts/ssot_remediation/validation_suite.py phase2

# If Stage 2 insufficient:
# Stage 3: Phase reset (see Procedure 2 above)

# If Stage 3 insufficient:
# Stage 4: Emergency restore (see Procedure 3 above)
```

### **Protocol 4: Recovery Validation Framework**

#### Post-Rollback Validation:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: scripts/ssot_remediation/post_rollback_validation.sh

echo "🔍 Post-Rollback Validation Framework"

# 1. System stability check
echo "⏳ Checking system stability..."
python scripts/ssot_remediation/validation_suite.py full

# 2. Performance baseline validation
echo "⏳ Validating performance baseline..."
python scripts/ssot_remediation/monitoring_and_tracking.py record-metric "response_time" "$(measure_response_time)" "ms" "post_rollback"

# 3. Integration testing
echo "⏳ Running integration validation..."
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --categories integration --real-services

# 4. User flow validation
echo "⏳ Validating user flows..."
python tests/e2e/test_auth_backend_desynchronization.py
python tests/integration/test_authenticated_chat_workflow_comprehensive.py

# 5. Generate recovery report
echo "📊 Generating recovery validation report..."
python scripts/ssot_remediation/monitoring_and_tracking.py trend-report 1

echo "✅ Post-rollback validation complete"
```
