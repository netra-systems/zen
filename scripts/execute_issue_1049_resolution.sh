# Create Issue 1: WebSocket Test Infrastructure Consolidation
echo "Creating Issue 1: WebSocket Test Infrastructure Consolidation..."
gh issue create --title "WebSocket Test Infrastructure Consolidation" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Background
During the resolution of WebSocket event structure issues (#1021), we accumulated 500+ WebSocket test files with significant duplication and outdated expectations. This technical debt creates confusion and maintenance overhead.

## Objective
Consolidate and modernize the WebSocket test infrastructure to provide a maintainable, SSOT-compliant test suite.

## Scope & Deliverables

### 1. Test Consolidation
- [ ] Audit all 500+ WebSocket test files
- [ ] Identify and remove duplicates
- [ ] Consolidate to <50 essential test files
- [ ] Create single `test_websocket_ssot_suite.py` as primary test

### 2. Cleanup Outdated Expectations
- [ ] Update tests expecting flat event structure (pre-#1021)
- [ ] Ensure all tests expect payload wrapper structure: `{"payload": data}`
- [ ] Remove tests for deprecated event formats

### 3. Remove Legacy Artifacts
- [ ] Delete all `.backup.20250915_*` files
- [ ] Remove temporary test files
- [ ] Clean up orphaned test utilities

### 4. SSOT Compliance
- [ ] Ensure all tests inherit from `SSotBaseTestCase`
- [ ] Use `SSotMockFactory` for any required mocks
- [ ] Follow test infrastructure patterns from `/test_framework/ssot/`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] WebSocket tests reduced from 500+ to <50 files
- [ ] All tests pass with real services (`--real-services`)
- [ ] Zero duplicate test implementations
- [ ] Clear test organization with obvious purpose for each file
- [ ] 100% SSOT compliance for test infrastructure

## Dependencies
- Depends on: Issue #1021 resolution (COMPLETED)
- References: `ISSUE_UNTANGLE_1049_20250116_claude.md`

## Technical Notes
- The payload wrapper fix from #1021 is the canonical structure
- Tests should validate `{"payload": processed_data}` format
- Preserve mission-critical WebSocket event tests

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Priority
P1 - High (Technical Debt Reduction)

## References
- Original confusion: Issue #1049
- Technical fix: Issue #1021

# Create Issue 2: Complete WebSocket Event Structure Documentation
echo "Creating Issue 2: Complete WebSocket Event Structure Documentation..."
gh issue create --title "Complete WebSocket Event Structure Documentation" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Background
Issue #1021 successfully resolved the WebSocket event structure mismatch by implementing a payload wrapper pattern. However, this critical architectural decision lacks proper documentation, leading to confusion (see Issue #1049).

## Objective
Create comprehensive documentation for the WebSocket event structure, ensuring all teams understand the canonical format and migration path.

## Scope & Deliverables

### 1. Create Canonical Mermaid Diagrams
- [ ] WebSocket event flow sequence diagram
- [ ] Event payload structure diagram showing wrapper pattern
- [ ] Component interaction diagram for event handling

### 2. Document Payload Wrapper Pattern
- [ ] Explain the change from flat to wrapped structure
- [ ] Document why: `{"payload": processed_data}` not `{**processed_data}`
- [ ] Provide before/after examples

### 3. Migration Guide
- [ ] Step-by-step guide for updating event consumers
- [ ] Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- [ ] Validation checklist for implementations

### 4. Update Existing Documentation
- [ ] Update `docs/agent_architecture_mermaid.md`
- [ ] Add new `docs/websocket_event_structure.md`
- [ ] Update WebSocket sections in README files

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Clear mermaid diagrams showing event structure
- [ ] Complete documentation of Issue #1021 resolution
- [ ] Migration guide validated by frontend team
- [ ] No ambiguity about expected event format
- [ ] Documentation passes team review

## Dependencies
- References: Issue #1021 (payload wrapper implementation)
- References: Issue #1049 (confusion that prompted this)

## Technical Specifications
### Current Event Structure (Post-#1021)
\`\`\`json

  "payload": {
    "tool_name": "example_tool",
    "args": {},

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Priority

# Create Issue 3: Enhance WebSocket Health Monitoring
echo "Creating Issue 3: Enhance WebSocket Health Monitoring..."
gh issue create --title "Enhance WebSocket Health Monitoring" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Background
During Issue #1049 investigation, we discovered that WebSocket health checks need improvement, particularly for staging environments where graceful degradation is required.

## Objective
Implement comprehensive WebSocket health monitoring with proper observability and alerting.

## Scope & Deliverables

### 1. Improve Health Check Endpoints
- [ ] Review `/health` endpoint WebSocket checks
- [ ] Implement detailed status codes beyond 503
- [ ] Add WebSocket-specific health metrics
- [ ] Ensure proper timeout handling

### 2. Monitoring Dashboard
- [ ] Create WebSocket metrics dashboard
- [ ] Track: Connection count, event throughput, error rates
- [ ] Monitor: Event delivery success rates per type
- [ ] Visualize: Latency distributions for events

### 3. Alerting Rules
- [ ] Alert on WebSocket service unavailability
- [ ] Alert on event delivery failures >1%
- [ ] Alert on connection pool exhaustion
- [ ] Alert on unusual disconnection patterns

### 4. Graceful Degradation
- [ ] Improve staging environment fallbacks
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker patterns
- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Ensure proper error messages to clients

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Health checks accurately reflect service state
- [ ] Zero false-positive 503 errors
- [ ] Dashboard shows real-time WebSocket metrics
- [ ] Alerts fire appropriately for actual issues
- [ ] Staging environment handles degradation gracefully

## Dependencies
- References: `test_websocket_health_fix.py`
- Related to: Issue #1049 health check concerns

## Technical Requirements
### Health Check Response Format
\`\`\`json
{
  "status": "healthy|degraded|unhealthy",
  "websocket": {
    "connections": 42,
    "events_per_minute": 250,
    "last_event": "2025-01-16T10:00:00Z",
    "errors_last_hour": 0,
    "circuit_breaker": "closed"
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Metrics to Track
- Connection lifecycle (connect/disconnect/errors)
- Event processing (sent/received/failed)
- Latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Resource utilization (memory/CPU per connection)

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Priority
P2 - Medium (Operational Excellence)

## Resolution Summary: Issue Successfully Resolved ✅

After comprehensive analysis (see [`ISSUE_UNTANGLE_1049_20250116_claude.md`](/ISSUE_UNTANGLE_1049_20250116_claude.md)), we've determined that **the core technical problem was already successfully resolved in Issue #1021**.

### What Was Fixed
Issue #1021 implemented the payload wrapper pattern that resolved the WebSocket event structure mismatch:
- **Before:** Events spread to root level with `{**processed_data}`
- **After:** Events properly wrapped with `{"payload": processed_data}`
- **Result:** Frontend and backend now communicate with consistent event structure

### Why This Issue Appeared Unresolved
1. **Documentation Lag:** The successful fix wasn't properly documented
2. **Test Noise:** 500+ WebSocket test files created confusion about what was actually broken
3. **Issue Tracking:** This meta-issue wasn't updated after the technical resolution

### Current State
✅ **WebSocket events are working correctly in production**
✅ **Frontend receives properly structured payloads**
✅ **Event monitoring is operational**
✅ **Golden Path user flow is functional**

### Follow-up Actions
To prevent future confusion and clean up technical debt, we've created three focused issues:

1. **#1301 - WebSocket Test Infrastructure Consolidation**
   - Reduce 500+ test files to <50
   - Remove outdated test expectations
   - Achieve 100% SSOT compliance

2. **#1302 - Complete WebSocket Event Structure Documentation**
   - Create canonical mermaid diagrams
   - Document the payload wrapper pattern
   - Provide migration guides

3. **#1303 - Enhance WebSocket Health Monitoring**
   - Improve health check accuracy
   - Add monitoring dashboards
   - Implement proper alerting

### Technical Details
The fix from Issue #1021 changed the event structure in `/netra_backend/app/websocket_core/unified_manager.py`:
\`\`\`python
# Old (incorrect): Spread to root
return {**processed_data}

# New (correct): Wrapped in payload
return {"payload": processed_data}
\`\`\`

This ensures consistent structure between backend and frontend expectations.
