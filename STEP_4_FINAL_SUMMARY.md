**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Step 4 successfully delivered the complete SSOT upgrade of mission-critical test files, transitioning from placeholder implementations to real, production-grade tests that protect the Golden Path WebSocket events critical for $500K+ ARR. All commits have been successfully created and system validation shows healthy SSOT compliance across all components.

## ✅ Key Achievements

### 1. SSOT Test Infrastructure Upgraded
**Files Successfully Upgraded:**
- **`/tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_basic_events.py`** - ✅ Converted from placeholder to real SSOT implementation
- **`/tests/mission_critical/test_staging_websocket_agent_events_enhanced.py`** - ✅ Enhanced with comprehensive validation 
- **`/tests/unit/golden_path/test_agent_execution_core_golden_path.py`** - ✅ Upgraded with proper SSOT inheritance
- **Additional E2E tests** - ✅ Enhanced circuit breaker and auth desynchronization robustness

### 2. Business Value Protected
**Golden Path Assurance:**
- ✅ All 5 business-critical WebSocket events now validated: `agent_started`, `agent_thinking`, `tool_executing`, `tool_completed`, `agent_completed`
- ✅ Real service integration tests replace unreliable mock-based placeholders
- ✅ $500K+ ARR dependency on chat functionality properly tested and protected
- ✅ Production deployment confidence significantly increased

### 3. System Health Validation
**SSOT Compliance Verified:**
```
✅ WebSocket Manager SSOT validation: PASS
✅ Factory methods added to UnifiedWebSocketEmitter (Issue #582 remediation complete)  
✅ WebSocket SSOT loaded - factory pattern available, singleton vulnerabilities mitigated
✅ Configuration loaded and cached for development environment
✅ AuthServiceClient initialized with service secret configured
✅ Database and Redis managers initialized successfully
```
