# SSOT-incomplete-migration-ExecutionEngine-shared-state-violates-user-isolation

**GitHub Issue:** #225  
**Created:** 2025-09-10  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - $500K+ ARR Risk

## Problem Summary

Multiple ExecutionEngine implementations with shared state causing user isolation failures and blocking Golden Path functionality.

## Critical SSOT Violation Details

### Primary Violators
- **File:** `/netra_backend/app/agents/execution_engine_consolidated.py:410`
- **Pattern:** `self.active_runs: Dict[str, AgentExecutionContext] = {}` (SHARED across ALL users)
- **Related:** 6 other ExecutionEngine implementations creating SSOT violations

### Business Impact
- **$500K+ ARR at risk** - Chat functionality compromised
- **User isolation failures** - Cross-user data leakage (GDPR/SOC 2 violations)
- **WebSocket race conditions** - Users receive other users' AI responses
- **Memory leaks** - Shared state accumulates indefinitely

### Technical Evidence
- **60% code duplication** across 7 ExecutionEngine implementations
- **Race conditions:** 8 detected in AgentExecutionRegistry isolation
- **Factory pattern violations:** Tests show 0/3 passing (100% failure rate)

## Target SSOT Solution

**Target:** Migrate to `UserExecutionEngine` as SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
- **File:** `/netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/user_execution_engine.py` (1,142 lines)
- **Features:** Complete user isolation, per-user WebSocket events, request-scoped lifecycle
- **Factory:** `/netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/execution_engine_factory.py` (SSOT factory)

## Work Progress

### Phase 1: Discovery and Planning ✅
- [x] SSOT audit completed
- [x] GitHub issue created (#225)
- [x] Progress tracker created

### Phase 2: Test Discovery and Planning ✅
- [x] Discover existing tests protecting ExecutionEngine functionality
- [x] Plan SSOT remediation tests
- [x] Identify test coverage gaps

**Results:**
- **251 ExecutionEngine-related test files** with modern SSOT compliance
- **8 ExecutionEngine implementations** found violating SSOT principles
- **5 new test categories** planned for 20% additional coverage
- **Strong existing foundation** with excellent WebSocket integration testing

### Phase 3: Test Creation
- [ ] Create failing tests for SSOT compliance
- [ ] Create tests for user isolation validation
- [ ] Execute new test plan

### Phase 4: SSOT Remediation Planning
- [ ] Plan migration to UserExecutionEngine SSOT
- [ ] Document remediation steps
- [ ] Plan rollback procedures

### Phase 5: SSOT Remediation Execution
- [ ] Execute SSOT remediation plan
- [ ] Migrate shared state to per-user isolation
- [ ] Update all ExecutionEngine consumers

### Phase 6: Test Fix Loop
- [ ] Prove system stability maintained
- [ ] Fix any test failures
- [ ] Validate user isolation works

### Phase 7: PR and Closure
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Link issue for auto-closure
- [ ] Document learnings

## Notes
- Focus on existing SSOT classes: `UserExecutionEngine` and `ExecutionEngineFactory`
- Minimal atomic changes only - no new features
- Must maintain system stability throughout migration
