# WebSocket-Redis Integration Instability Causing System-Wide Failures

## Summary
WebSocket-Redis integration failures cause system-wide instability with connection pool efficiency at 25%, monitoring coverage at 45%, and resource utilization at 40%, preventing production deployment.

## Description
The integration between WebSocket and Redis systems is fundamentally unstable, causing cascading failures across the entire platform. This affects real-time communication, state management, and monitoring capabilities.

## Technical Details

### Current Performance Metrics
- **Connection Pool Efficiency**: 25% (Critical)
- **Resource Utilization**: 40% (Poor)
- **Monitoring Coverage**: 45% (Inadequate)
- **Redis Visibility**: Poor - Multiple managers obscure metrics
- **WebSocket Tracking**: Incomplete - Missing critical event monitoring

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Multiple Redis Managers**: 12 competing implementations fragment connection pools
2. **Event Loop Conflicts**: Asyncio management issues in concurrent scenarios
3. **State Synchronization**: Inconsistent state between WebSocket and Redis layers
4. **Monitoring Blind Spots**: Unable to track integration health effectively

### Integration Failure Points
- WebSocket connection establishment
- Real-time event delivery
- Session state persistence
- Cross-service communication
- Error recovery mechanisms

### Business Impact
- **Chat Functionality**: Primary value delivery mechanism compromised
- **User Experience**: High disconnect rates, failed message delivery
- **Operational Visibility**: Cannot monitor production health effectively
- **Scalability**: System cannot handle production load

### Evidence Files
- `STAGING_TEST_REPORT_PYTEST.md` - Integration health scores
- `netra_backend/app/websocket_core/` - WebSocket integration code
- `netra_backend/app/services/redis_client.py` - Redis integration points
- `tests/integration/redis_ssot/` - Integration test failures

### Related Issues
- Connects to Redis SSOT violations (multiple managers)
- Affects WebSocket 1011 errors
- Impacts golden path production readiness
- Blocks monitoring and observability

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Connection pool efficiency: >90%
- [ ] Resource utilization: >80%
- [ ] Monitoring coverage: >90%
- [ ] Redis visibility: Comprehensive metrics from single manager
- [ ] WebSocket tracking: Complete event monitoring pipeline
- [ ] Integration test pass rate: >95%
- [ ] No connection pool fragmentation
- [ ] Stable state synchronization between layers

## Priority
**Critical (P0)** - Affects core infrastructure stability
