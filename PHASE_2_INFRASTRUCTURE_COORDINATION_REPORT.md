---

## 1. VPC Connector Status Assessment

### Infrastructure Monitoring Available
- ✅ **Monitoring Script:** `scripts/monitor_infrastructure_health.py`
- ✅ **Validation Script:** `scripts/validate_infrastructure_fix.py`
- ✅ **Issue-Specific Checker:** `scripts/infrastructure_health_check_issue_1278.py`

### VPC Connector Requirements (Infrastructure Team Action Required)
The development team has validated that monitoring infrastructure is ready. Infrastructure team should verify:

1. **VPC Connector Configuration:**
   - Name: `staging-connector`
   - Traffic routing: All-traffic egress
   - Capacity: Sufficient for Cloud Run database connections
   - Region: `us-central1`

2. **Expected Endpoints:**
   - Backend: `https://staging.netrasystems.ai`
   - Frontend: `https://staging.netrasystems.ai`
   - WebSocket: `wss://api-staging.netrasystems.ai`

### Action for Infrastructure Team
```bash
# Use development team's monitoring script
python scripts/monitor_infrastructure_health.py
python scripts/infrastructure_health_check_issue_1278.py
```

---

## 2. Database Connection Pool Testing Results

### ✅ Timeout Configuration Validation

**Database Manager Configuration (Verified):**
```python
# From netra_backend/app/db/database_manager.py
pool_timeout = 30          # 30 second timeout
command_timeout = 30       # 30 second query timeout
pool_recycle = 1800       # Reduced from 3600 to 1800s for faster recycling
```

**PostgreSQL Event Configuration (Verified):**
```python
# From netra_backend/app/db/postgres_events.py
cursor.execute("SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 60000")  # 60 seconds
```

**GCP Deployment Configuration (Verified):**
- Database timeout: 600s (implemented across deployment scripts)
- VPC connector timeout alignment: Configured
- Cloud Run startup timeout: Extended for database initialization

### Connection Pool Testing Status
✅ **Configuration Present:** All timeout settings properly configured in code
✅ **Emergency Bypass:** Database manager includes proper fallback handling
⏳ **Infrastructure Testing:** Requires live staging environment validation

---

## 3. WebSocket Timeout Verification Results

### ✅ WebSocket Timeout Configuration Analysis

**Production Environment Timeouts (Current Implementation):**
```python
# From netra_backend/app/websocket_core/utils.py
{
    "connection_timeout_seconds": 600,    # ✅ 10 minutes (Issue #1278 requirement)
    "heartbeat_timeout_seconds": 120,     # ✅ 2 minutes
    "message_timeout_seconds": 90,        # ✅ 90 seconds
    "handshake_timeout_seconds": 45,      # ✅ 45 seconds
    "close_timeout_seconds": 15           # ✅ 15 seconds
}
```

**Development Environment Timeouts:**
```python
{
    "connection_timeout_seconds": 300,    # 5 minutes (appropriate for dev)
    "heartbeat_timeout_seconds": 90,
    "message_timeout_seconds": 60,
    "handshake_timeout_seconds": 30,
    "close_timeout_seconds": 10
}
```

### WebSocket Infrastructure Status
✅ **Timeout Implementation:** All required timeouts properly configured
✅ **Environment Differentiation:** Production vs. development timeouts correctly set
✅ **Cloud Run Compatibility:** Timeouts aligned with Cloud Run constraints

## 4. Infrastructure Health Monitoring Status

### Available Monitoring Tools
1. **Primary Monitor:** `scripts/monitor_infrastructure_health.py`
   - Real-time health endpoint monitoring
   - VPC connectivity testing
   - SSL certificate validation
   - Response time measurement

2. **Validation Suite:** `scripts/validate_infrastructure_fix.py`
   - Post-fix validation framework
   - Comprehensive health assessment
   - Infrastructure team sign-off recommendations

3. **Issue-Specific Checker:** `scripts/infrastructure_health_check_issue_1278.py`
   - Targeted Issue #1278 validation
   - VPC connector specific checks
   - Database timeout validation

### Monitoring Capabilities Ready
✅ **Endpoint Health Checks:** All staging endpoints configured
✅ **Timeout Validation:** Infrastructure-level timeout testing
✅ **SSL Certificate Checks:** Domain validation for `*.netrasystems.ai`
✅ **Load Balancer Validation:** Health check configuration testing

---

## 5. Infrastructure Team Action Items

### Immediate Actions Required (Infrastructure Team)
1. **VPC Connector Validation:**
   ```bash
   # Verify VPC connector capacity and configuration
   gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors describe staging-connector \
     --region=us-central1 --project=netra-staging
   ```

2. **Database Connection Testing:**
   ```bash
   # Test Cloud SQL connectivity through VPC connector
   python scripts/validate_infrastructure_fix.py --staging
   ```

3. **Load Balancer Configuration:**
   - Verify SSL certificates for `*.netrasystems.ai` domains
   - Validate health check timeouts (600s requirement)
   - Confirm backend service timeout settings

### Infrastructure Validation Commands
```bash
# Run comprehensive infrastructure health check
python scripts/monitor_infrastructure_health.py

# Validate specific Issue #1278 requirements
python scripts/infrastructure_health_check_issue_1278.py

# Post-fix validation (run after infrastructure changes)
python scripts/validate_infrastructure_fix.py --staging
```
