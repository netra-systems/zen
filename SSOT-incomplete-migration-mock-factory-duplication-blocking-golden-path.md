# SSOT Mock Factory Duplication - Golden Path Blocker

## Issue Information
- **GitHub Issue**: #1107
- **URL**: https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/1107
- **Status**: Created - Discovery Phase Complete
- **Priority**: P0 - Critical Golden Path Blocker

## Executive Summary
Discovered 23,086 total mock violations with 1,147 unjustified mock patterns blocking Golden Path reliability. Chat functionality testing compromised by mock inconsistencies affecting $500K+ ARR validation.

## Critical Findings

### Mock Violation Breakdown
- **WebSocket Mock Violations**: 1,073 (affects real-time chat)
- **Agent Mock Violations**: 284 (affects AI response pipeline) 
- **Database Mock Violations**: 582 (affects persistence layer)
- **Generic Mock Violations**: 21,147 (technical debt)

### SSOT Solution Available
- **SSOT Mock Factory**: `/test_framework/ssot/mock_factory.py`
- **Proper Usage Pattern**: `SSotMockFactory.create_agent_mock(agent_type='supervisor')`
- **Ready for Migration**: Yes - infrastructure exists

### Golden Path Impact Assessment
- **Chat Testing**: Mock inconsistencies prevent reliable WebSocket event validation
- **Agent Pipeline**: AI response testing affected by mock pattern fragmentation
- **Multi-User System**: Testing isolation compromised by mixed mock approaches
- **Business Risk**: Primary value delivery (chat) validation unreliable

## Process Status

### Phase 0: Discovery ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] SSOT audit completed
- [x] GitHub issue #1107 created  
- [x] Local tracking file created
- [x] Critical violations identified and prioritized

### Phase 1: Test Plan Discovery ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Discover existing tests protecting against breaking changes
- [x] Plan new tests for SSOT mock consolidation validation  
- [x] Following TEST_CREATION_GUIDE.md best practices
- [x] **Discovery Report**: `SSOT_Mock_Factory_Test_Discovery_Planning_Report_Issue_1107.md`
- [x] **Key Finding**: 10 new tests planned, SSOT infrastructure ready

### Phase 2: Test Creation (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Create new SSOT mock validation tests
- [ ] Focus on WebSocket and Agent mock patterns
- [ ] Target 20% new tests, 60% existing test validation, 20% SSOT fixes
- [ ] Run validation tests (unit, integration non-docker, e2e staging only)

### Phase 3: Remediation Planning (PENDING)
- [ ] Plan migration from direct mocks to SSOT factory
- [ ] Prioritize by Golden Path impact

### Phase 4: Remediation Execution (PENDING)
- [ ] Execute mock factory migration
- [ ] Maintain system stability

### Phase 5: Test Fix Loop (PENDING) 
- [ ] Validate all tests pass after changes
- [ ] Fix any regressions or issues

### Phase 6: PR and Closure (PENDING)
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Link to issue for closure

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Check current mock violations
python3 -m pytest tests/mission_critical/test_ssot_mock_duplication_violations.py -v

# SSOT compliance validation  
python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py

# Mission critical tests
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py
```

- **SSOT Import Registry**: `/SSOT_IMPORT_REGISTRY.md`
- **Test Execution Guide**: `/reports/TEST_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md`
- **CLAUDE.md Testing Section**: Focus on real services, no mocks in integration/E2E
