6. **`test_websocket_singleton_vulnerability.py`** - Vulnerability documentation

## Security Analysis Results

### ‚úÖ CRITICAL SECURITY GUARANTEES VALIDATED

#### 1. Complete User Isolation
**Finding:** SECURE ‚úÖ
- Each user receives a unique `IsolatedWebSocketManager` instance
- No shared state between user managers
- Private connection dictionaries per user: `self._connections: Dict[str, WebSocketConnection] = {}`
- Independent message queues and error recovery per user
- Validation confirms: `assert manager._connections is not other_manager._connections`

#### 2. UserExecutionContext Enforcement  
**Finding:** SECURE ‚úÖ
- Strict validation: `if not isinstance(user_context, UserExecutionContext): raise ValueError`
- User ID validation on all operations: `if connection.user_id != self.user_context.user_id: raise ValueError`
- Connection hijacking prevention with critical security logging
- Context isolation enforced at factory level: `_generate_isolation_key()`

#### 3. Resource Cleanup and Lifecycle Management
**Finding:** SECURE ‚úÖ
- Comprehensive cleanup via `ConnectionLifecycleManager`
- Automatic cleanup of expired connections every 60 seconds
- Force cleanup on disconnect: `await manager.cleanup_all_connections()`
- Memory leak prevention with weak references and garbage collection
- Resource limits enforced: `max_managers_per_user` with overflow protection

#### 4. Thread Safety and Race Condition Prevention
**Finding:** SECURE ‚úÖ
- Thread-safe factory operations with `RLock()`: `self._factory_lock = RLock()`
- Async locks for manager operations: `self._manager_lock = asyncio.Lock()`
- Atomic connection management with proper locking
- Concurrent operation safety validated in tests

#### 5. Connection Hijacking Prevention
**Finding:** SECURE ‚úÖ
- Critical security validation in `add_connection()`:
  ```python
  if conn.user_id != self.user_context.user_id:
      logger.critical(f"SECURITY VIOLATION: Attempted to register connection for user {conn.user_id} 
                       in manager for user {self.user_context.user_id}")
      raise ValueError("Connection user_id does not match context user_id")
  ```
- Security audit logging for all violations
- Connection ownership verification on all operations

#### 6. Migration Safety
**Finding:** SECURE ‚úÖ
- Backward compatibility layer maintains security
- Legacy usage automatically creates isolated managers
- Migration warnings track singleton usage
- No security degradation during transition period
