# GitHub Issues to Create for Golden Path Test Failures

Based on the test failures identified, here are the GitHub issues that need to be created:

## Issue 1: Agent Execution Context Timing Issue

**Title:** `[BUG] Agent execution context timing issue causes test failure in golden path validator`

**Labels:** `P1`, `bug`, `golden-path`, `claude-code-generated-issue`

**Body:**
```markdown
## Impact
Golden path test failure prevents validation of agent execution order, compromising business logic testing for core pipeline (Data → Optimization → Report).

## Current Behavior
Test **test_execution_context_tracking** (AgentExecutionOrderValidatorTests) fails with:
```
AssertionError: Should have positive duration, assert 0.0 > 0
```

## Expected Behavior
Agent execution context should track positive duration between start_time and end_time for proper execution timing validation.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run: `python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category unit --filter test_execution_context_tracking`
2. Test fails on duration assertion
3. Root cause: start_time and end_time are identical due to timing resolution

## Technical Details
- **File:** `tests/unit/golden_path/test_agent_execution_order_validator.py:295`
- **Error:** `assert 0.0 > 0` on line 295 (duration check)
- **Root Cause:** Timing issue where start_time and end_time are identical
- **Business Impact:** Golden path validation logic cannot verify proper execution timing

## Solution Required
Add small delay or use more precise timing mechanism in AgentExecutionContext.mark_completed() method to ensure measurable duration.
```

## Issue 2: Business Value Protection Mock Setup Issue

**Title:** `[BUG] Mock setup prevents proper correlation data capture in business value protection tests`

**Labels:** `P1`, `bug`, `golden-path`, `claude-code-generated-issue`

**Body:**
```markdown
## Impact
Golden path business value protection test fails, preventing validation of $500K+ ARR debugging capabilities through correlation tracking.

## Current Behavior
Test **test_business_impact_of_logging_disconnection** (GoldenPathBusinessValueProtectionTests) fails with:
```
INSUFFICIENT BUSINESS VALUE: SSOT logging improvement 0.00% is below required 30%
```

## Expected Behavior
Mock setup should properly capture correlation data to demonstrate business value improvement from unified logging patterns.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run: `python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category unit --filter test_business_impact_of_logging_disconnection`
2. Test fails on business value assertion
3. Root cause: Mock setup doesn't properly capture correlation data

## Technical Details
- **File:** `tests/unit/golden_path/test_golden_path_business_value_protection.py:342`
- **Error:** Debugging effectiveness improvement 0.00% below required 30%
- **Root Cause:** Mock loggers not capturing correlation context properly
- **Business Impact:** Cannot validate ROI of SSOT logging remediation for customer support

## Solution Required
Fix mock setup in _simulate_execution_logging() to properly capture and differentiate between mixed vs unified logging scenarios.
```

## Issue 3: Golden Path Phase Detection Issue

**Title:** `[BUG] Phase detection logic fails in golden path execution flow traceability test`

**Labels:** `P1`, `bug`, `golden-path`, `claude-code-generated-issue`

**Body:**
```markdown
## Impact
Golden path execution flow cannot be properly traced for customer support, compromising enterprise customer debugging capabilities.

## Current Behavior
Test **test_golden_path_execution_flow_traceable** (GoldenPathBusinessValueProtectionTests) fails with:
```
GOLDEN PATH VISIBILITY INSUFFICIENT: Phase coverage 0.00% is below required 70%
```

## Expected Behavior
Phase detection logic should properly identify and track execution phases for customer support visibility.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run: `python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category unit --filter test_golden_path_execution_flow_traceable`
2. Test fails on phase coverage assertion
3. Root cause: Phase detection logic not working correctly

## Technical Details
- **File:** `tests/unit/golden_path/test_golden_path_business_value_protection.py:248`
- **Error:** Phase coverage 0.00% below required 70%
- **Root Cause:** Phase detection in capture_phases() function not matching expected phases
- **Business Impact:** Enterprise customers cannot receive effective support without execution flow visibility

## Solution Required
Fix phase detection logic in capture_phases() function to properly match and track the expected execution phases: execution_started, context_validated, agent_initialized, processing_started, execution_tracked, completion_attempted.
```

## Commands to Create Issues

Since GitHub CLI requires approval, use these commands manually:

```bash
# Issue 1
gh issue create --title "[BUG] Agent execution context timing issue causes test failure in golden path validator" --body-file issue1_body.md --label "P1,bug,golden-path,claude-code-generated-issue"

# Issue 2
gh issue create --title "[BUG] Mock setup prevents proper correlation data capture in business value protection tests" --body-file issue2_body.md --label "P1,bug,golden-path,claude-code-generated-issue"

# Issue 3
gh issue create --title "[BUG] Phase detection logic fails in golden path execution flow traceability test" --body-file issue3_body.md --label "P1,bug,golden-path,claude-code-generated-issue"
```

## Search Terms Used

The following search terms were attempted to find existing issues:
- "golden path"
- "test failures"
- "AgentExecutionOrderValidatorTests"
- "GoldenPathBusinessValueProtectionTests"
- Git log search for related commit history

## Status

- **SEARCH RESULT:** No access to existing issues due to GitHub CLI authentication requirements
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Create all three issues as new since no duplicates could be verified
- **PRIORITY:** All marked as P1 due to golden path business impact
- **BUSINESS IMPACT:** These test failures affect validation of core $500K+ ARR business logic
