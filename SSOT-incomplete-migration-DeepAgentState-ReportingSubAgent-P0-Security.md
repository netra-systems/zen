# SSOT-incomplete-migration-DeepAgentState-ReportingSubAgent-P0-Security

**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/354
**Priority:** P0 CRITICAL SECURITY
**Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality

## Current Status: TEST PLANNING COMPLETE

### Step 0: SSOT AUDIT ✅ COMPLETE
- **Issue Created:** https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/354
- **Root Cause:** DeepAgentState active usage in ReportingSubAgent violates user isolation security
- **Critical Files Identified:**
  - `netra_backend/app/agents/reporting_sub_agent.py:245` - Primary violation
  - `netra_backend/app/services/user_execution_context.py:577` - Compatibility layer
  - `netra_backend/app/services/state_persistence.py` - Secondary violation
  - `netra_backend/app/services/query_builder.py` - Secondary violation

### Step 1: DISCOVER AND PLAN TEST ✅ COMPLETE
**Existing Test Coverage:** 24 test files with ReportingSubAgent coverage discovered
- Unit Tests: 6 files
- Integration Tests: 12 files  
- E2E Tests: 4 files
- Mission Critical: 2 files

**Test Strategy Planned:** 25 tests total (60% existing updated + 20% SSOT validation + 20% security)
- **Before Migration:** Security tests FAIL (proving vulnerability)  
- **After Migration:** Security tests PASS (proving fix)
- **No Docker dependency:** Unit, integration (non-Docker), GCP staging E2E only

### Next Steps (PROCESS INSTRUCTIONS)

- [ ] Step 2: EXECUTE THE TEST PLAN  
- [ ] Step 3: PLAN REMEDIATION OF SSOT
- [ ] Step 4: EXECUTE THE REMEDIATION SSOT PLAN
- [ ] Step 5: ENTER TEST FIX LOOP
- [ ] Step 6: PR AND CLOSURE

## Detailed Analysis

### Security Vulnerability Details
ReportingSubAgent processes confidential business data (AI cost analysis, optimization recommendations) with DeepAgentState allowing shared state between concurrent users. This creates direct risk of User A receiving User B's sensitive business data.

### SSOT Violation Pattern
Despite Issue #271 Phase 1 "completion" claims, critical Golden Path components still actively import and use DeepAgentState instead of UserExecutionContext SSOT pattern.

### Business Impact Assessment
- **90% of platform value**: Agent-generated reports affected
- **Enterprise customers**: Multi-user concurrent access vulnerable  
- **Revenue risk**: $500K+ ARR from data confidentiality breach
- **Golden Path blocked**: Core user login → AI response flow compromised
