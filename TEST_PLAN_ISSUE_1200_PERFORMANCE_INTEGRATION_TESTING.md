# Test Plan: Issue #1200 - Performance Integration Testing

**Issue:** #1200 Golden Path Phase 6.4: Performance Integration Testing - Race Condition Elimination
**Priority:** P1 (High Priority)
**Parent Issue:** #1176 (Master Plan for Golden Path)
**Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR protection - system performance reliability
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Created:** 2025-09-15
**Status:** PLANNING PHASE

## Executive Summary

This test plan outlines the creation of 5 critical performance integration test files to validate Golden Path performance SLAs and eliminate race conditions throughout the integrated system. The tests follow the SSOT testing patterns established in the codebase and are designed to **initially FAIL** to demonstrate current performance gaps and race conditions.

## Business Value Justification

- **Revenue Protection:** $500K+ ARR dependent on Golden Path performance
- **Enterprise Readiness:** Performance SLAs critical for enterprise customers
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Sub-60 second Golden Path completion essential for user retention
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Performance consistency required for HIPAA, SOC2, SEC compliance
- **Competitive Advantage:** Superior performance differentiates Netra from competitors

## Current System State Analysis

### Existing Performance Infrastructure
- **Golden Path Performance Test:** `tests/performance/test_golden_path_performance.py` (established patterns)
- **Race Condition Tests:** `tests/race_conditions/test_race_condition_elimination_suite.py` (existing patterns)
- **WebSocket Performance:** `tests/performance/test_websocket_performance.py` (WebSocket patterns)
- **Memory Monitoring:** `tests/performance/test_isolation_performance.py` (memory patterns)
- **Concurrent Load:** `tests/performance/test_hardened_registry_concurrent_load.py` (load patterns)

### Performance SLA Requirements (from Issue #1200)
- **Complete User Flow:** < 60 seconds (login â†’ AI response)
- **Authentication:** < 5 seconds (user login)
- **WebSocket Connection:** < 3 seconds (connection establishment)
- **Agent Execution:** < 45 seconds (typical AI request)
- **Response Delivery:** < 2 seconds (final response delivery)
- **Configuration Access:** < 10ms (config lookup)
- **Agent Factory:** < 500ms (agent instantiation)
- **Database Operations:** < 1 second (typical queries)

### Known Race Conditions from Staging Logs
- **WebSocket Connection Establishment:** Race conditions in WebSocket startup handshake
- **Agent Factory Instantiation:** Concurrent agent creation conflicts
- **Configuration Access:** Thread-unsafe configuration loading
- **State Management:** Shared state contamination between users
- **Resource Cleanup:** Cleanup timing conflicts

## Test Plan Architecture

### Design Philosophy: FAIL-FIRST TESTING
All tests are designed to **initially FAIL** to:
1. **Demonstrate Current Gaps:** Prove performance issues exist
2. **Validate SLA Violations:** Show where system fails to meet requirements
3. **Expose Race Conditions:** Reproduce race conditions under load
4. **Baseline Current State:** Document current performance for comparison
5. **Guide Optimization:** Provide specific targets for performance improvements

### SSOT Testing Patterns
- **Base Class:** All tests inherit from `SSotAsyncTestCase`
- **Real Services:** No mocks - use staging environment integration
- **Environment Access:** Via `IsolatedEnvironment` only
- **WebSocket Testing:** Follow established WebSocket test patterns
- **Performance Monitoring:** Use `psutil` and `track_test_timing`
- **Concurrent Testing:** ThreadPoolExecutor with user isolation
