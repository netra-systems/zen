```

#### 2. Infrastructure Preparation
```bash
# Setup migration utilities and monitoring
cd /path/to/netra-core-generation-1

# Activate migration detection and tracking
python scripts/detect_deepagentstate_usage.py > migration_baseline.txt

# Create migration test suite structure  
mkdir -p tests/migration/security_validation
mkdir -p tests/migration/business_continuity
mkdir -p tests/migration/performance_validation

# Setup monitoring for migration progress
python scripts/setup_migration_monitoring.py
```

#### 3. P0 Critical File Assessment
```bash
# Analyze P0 files for immediate migration priority
CRITICAL_FILES=(
  "netra_backend/app/agents/base_agent.py"
  "netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/execution_engine.py" 
  "netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/agent_execution_core.py"
  "netra_backend/app/agents/execution_engine_consolidated.py"
)

for file in "${CRITICAL_FILES[@]}"; do
  echo "🚨 ANALYZING: $file"
  python scripts/analyze_migration_complexity.py "$file"
done
```

## 📋 PHASE 1: EMERGENCY SECURITY RESPONSE (Days 1-5)

### Day 1: Core Agent Infrastructure (P0 CRITICAL)
**Assigned Agent**: Critical Security Migration Specialist  
**Files**: `base_agent.py` (23 DeepAgentState patterns)

#### Migration Tasks:
1. **Analyze Current Patterns**:
   ```python
   # Current vulnerable pattern in base_agent.py:1102
   async def execute_modern(self, state: 'DeepAgentState', run_id: str) -> ExecutionResult:
       # 🚨 VULNERABILITY: Shared state object
   ```

2. **Implement Secure Pattern**:
   ```python
   # New secure pattern
   async def execute_modern(self, context: UserExecutionContext, run_id: str) -> ExecutionResult:
       # ✅ SECURE: Immutable per-user context
   ```

3. **Validation Requirements**:
   - [ ] Multi-user isolation test passes
   - [ ] WebSocket events route to correct users
   - [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
   - [ ] Performance impact <5%

**Success Criteria**: Zero shared state references, all agents inherit secure patterns

### Day 2: Core Execution Engines (P0 CRITICAL)  
**Assigned Agent**: Critical Security Migration Specialist  
**Files**: `execution_engine.py`, `agent_execution_core.py`

#### Critical Migration Points:
- User request routing and session management
- Agent pipeline execution with proper isolation
- WebSocket event emission with user context
- Database session association

**Validation**: Multi-user concurrent execution test suite

### Day 3: Business Logic Security (HIGH CRITICAL)
**Assigned Agent**: Business Logic Security Specialist  
**Files**: `data_helper_agent.py`, `quality_supervisor.py`

#### Business Continuity Requirements:
- [ ] All customer-facing APIs maintain compatibility
- [ ] Data processing workflows preserve user isolation  
- [ ] Quality metrics properly scoped to user contexts
- [ ] WebSocket progress updates route correctly

### Day 4: Factory & Routing Systems (HIGH CRITICAL)
**Assigned Agents**: Both specialists (parallel work)  
**Files**: `execution_factory.py`, `agent_routing.py`, `execution_context.py`

#### Critical Patterns:
- Factory methods create isolated contexts per request
- Agent routing respects user boundaries
- Execution context properly inherits user identification

### Day 5: Security Validation & Gates  
**Assigned Agent**: Migration Test Validation Specialist  
**Mission**: Comprehensive security validation of Phase 1 migrations

#### Validation Test Suite:
```python
class Phase1SecurityValidation:
    def test_zero_cross_user_contamination(self):
        """MANDATORY: Verify complete user isolation"""
        
    def test_websocket_event_routing(self):
        """MANDATORY: Events route to correct user connections"""
        
    def test_database_session_isolation(self):
        """MANDATORY: DB queries scoped to correct users"""
        
    def test_concurrent_user_execution(self):
        """MANDATORY: Multiple users execute without interference"""
```

## 📈 PHASE 2: BUSINESS VALUE PROTECTION (Days 6-10)

### Day 6: Revenue-Generating Components  
**Assigned Agent**: Business Logic Security Specialist

- Synthetic data workflows preserve user data boundaries  
- Premium feature functionality unaffected by migration
- API response formats remain consistent

### Day 7: Workflow Orchestration Security
**Files**: `demo_service/*.py`, workflow components

#### Critical Validations:
