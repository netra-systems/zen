## GCP Log Analysis Update - 2025-09-15 14:34

### New Database Timeout Occurrences Detected

**Time Range**: 2025-09-15T19:xx - 20:xx UTC (last 1 hour)
**Count**: 10 ERROR logs with database initialization timeouts

**Key Error Pattern**:
```
CRITICAL STARTUP FAILURE: Database initialization timeout after 25.0s in staging environment.
This may indicate Cloud SQL connection issues. Check POSTGRES_HOST configuration and Cloud SQL instance accessibility.
```

**Affected Files**:
- `/app/netra_backend/app/startup_module.py:71`
- `/app/netra_backend/app/smd.py:1005`

### Analysis
While the core timeout issue was resolved (8.0s â†’ 25.0s), these logs indicate persistent startup failures even with the extended timeout. This suggests potential infrastructure-level issues with Cloud SQL connectivity that require further investigation.

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Investigate Cloud SQL instance status and connectivity
2. Review VPC connector configuration for any recent changes
3. Monitor POSTGRES_HOST environment variable consistency
4. Consider implementing connection retry mechanisms
