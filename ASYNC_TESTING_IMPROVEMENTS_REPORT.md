## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Configuration Optimization
```ini
# pytest.ini - Leveraged existing configuration
asyncio_mode = auto
```
- Eliminates need for @pytest.mark.asyncio decorators
- Automatic async test detection and execution

### Resource Management Patterns
```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def websocket_test_context() -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncWebSocketTestManager, None]:
    """Async context manager for WebSocket test isolation"""
    manager = AsyncWebSocketTestManager()
    try:
        yield manager
    finally:
        await manager.cleanup_all()
```

### Transaction Isolation
```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def transaction_scope(self, session_id: str) -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]:
    """Async context manager for transaction scope with automatic cleanup"""
    session = await self._create_session(session_id)
    try:
        async with session.begin():
            yield session
    except Exception as e:
        await self._log_transaction_error(session_id, e)
        raise
    finally:
        await self._cleanup_session(session_id)
```
