        FAILING TESTS for NEW Issues Identified in Iteration 2

        This test suite replicates the NEW issues that emerged during iteration 2:
        1. Frontend build failure without detailed error reporting
        2. Backend process exit with code 1 during runtime
        3. Backend/Auth readiness check failures despite successful startup
        4. WebSocket validation warning (non-critical)

        These tests are designed to FAIL until the underlying issues are resolved.
        They demonstrate the exact failure scenarios observed in the dev launcher logs.

        Business Value Justification (BVJ):
        - Segment: Platform/Internal
        - Business Goal: Development Velocity, System Stability
        - Value Impact: Eliminates development friction, enables reliable debugging
        - Strategic Impact: Reduces operational overhead, prevents revenue loss from broken tooling
