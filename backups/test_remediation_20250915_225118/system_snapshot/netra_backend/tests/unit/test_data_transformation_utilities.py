Test Data Transformation Utilities Business Logic - Core Unit Tests

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Data transformation affects all user interactions and system operations)
- Business Goal: Operational excellence and data integrity through proper transformation
- Value Impact: Ensures data consistency and accurate business operations across environments
- Strategic Impact: CRITICAL - Data integrity directly affects customer experience and business reliability

This test suite validates the core business logic for data transformation utilities
that enable proper data handling, URL generation, and timing measurements.
