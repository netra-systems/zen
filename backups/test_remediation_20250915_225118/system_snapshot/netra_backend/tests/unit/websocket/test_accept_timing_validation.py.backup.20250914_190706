WebSocket Accept Timing Validation Unit Tests

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Stability & Risk Reduction  
- Value Impact: Prevents "Need to call accept first" errors that break chat functionality
- Strategic Impact: Protects $500K+ ARR by ensuring WebSocket connections are properly established

CRITICAL RACE CONDITION REPRODUCTION TESTS:
These tests are designed to FAIL initially to prove they reproduce the race condition.
They target the specific error: "WebSocket is not connected. Need to call 'accept' first."

Test Categories:
1. Accept Call Timing Validation - Validates accept() called before operations
2. Connection State Transition Timing - Tests state machine under rapid changes  
3. Accept with Concurrent Operations - Tests accept() protection against concurrent operations
4. GCP Network Handshake Simulation - Simulates GCP Cloud Run timing delays
5. Accept Timeout Handling - Tests behavior when accept() times out

CRITICAL: These tests use timing controls and mocking to artificially create race conditions
that naturally occur in GCP Cloud Run environments every 2-3 minutes.
