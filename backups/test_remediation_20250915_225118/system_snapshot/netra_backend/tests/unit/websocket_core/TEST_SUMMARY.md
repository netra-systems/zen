- Dataclass immutability testing
- WebSocket without send_json method
- Mixed WebSocket states in broadcast
- Complex data structure handling
- Large dataset performance
- Race condition handling

- Memory cleanup testing

## Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 78
- **Passed**: 78 (100%)
- **Failed**: 0
- **Warnings**: 2 (datetime.utcnow deprecation, pytest config)

## Key Findings

### Strengths Identified
1. **Robust Error Handling**: All error scenarios are handled gracefully with proper cleanup
2. **Thread Safety**: Async lock usage prevents race conditions
3. **User Isolation**: Proper separation of user connections
4. **Legacy Compatibility**: Excellent backward compatibility support
5. **Performance**: Handles large datasets efficiently
6. **Unicode Support**: Proper handling of international characters
7. **Memory Management**: No memory leaks detected
8. **State Consistency**: Internal state remains consistent across operations

### Potential Areas for Improvement
1. **Datetime Usage**: Using deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` (warning detected)
2. **Error Granularity**: Could differentiate between different types of WebSocket errors
3. **Metrics/Monitoring**: Could add more detailed connection health metrics
4. **Rate Limiting**: No built-in rate limiting for message sending
5. **Connection Heartbeat**: No automatic connection health checking

### Test Quality Assessment
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of all public methods and key scenarios
- **Isolation**: Each test is independent and focused on specific behavior
- **Reliability**: All tests pass consistently
- **Maintainability**: Clear test names and structure
- **Mocking**: Appropriate use of mocks for external dependencies
- **Edge Cases**: Good coverage of boundary conditions and error scenarios

## Recommendations

1. **Address Deprecation Warning**: Update to use `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` instead of `datetime.utcnow()`
2. **Add Rate Limiting Tests**: Create tests for message rate limiting functionality
3. **Add Health Check Tests**: Test connection heartbeat/ping-pong functionality
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Add performance regression tests
5. **Security Tests**: Add tests for malicious input handling
6. **Documentation**: Ensure all test scenarios are documented for future maintenance

## Test Execution
```bash
# Run all WebSocketManager tests
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/unit/websocket_core/test_websocket_manager.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/unit/websocket_core/test_websocket_manager.py --cov=netra_backend.app.websocket_core.unified_manager
```

The comprehensive test suite successfully validates the UnifiedWebSocketManager implementation and provides confidence in its reliability and robustness.
