Verification tests for async_utils_helpers timeout bug fix.

BUSINESS VALUE: Ensures unit test stability and prevents CI/CD pipeline delays
caused by excessive timeout values in test helpers.

This test suite verifies that the create_slow_connection_factory() function
no longer causes unit test timeouts and completes within acceptable limits.
