CRITICAL BUG REPRODUCTION TEST: ExecutionEngineFactory WebSocket Bridge Missing

This test reproduces the exact bug: "WebSocket bridge not available in agent factory" 
that occurs in ExecutionEngineFactory._create_user_websocket_emitter() method.

Business Value Impact:
- CRITICAL: Breaks agent execution completely
- CRITICAL: Prevents WebSocket events for chat (90% of business value)
- CRITICAL: Blocks integration tests and deployments

Bug Details:
- Error Location: execution_engine_factory.py:212
- Root Cause: AgentInstanceFactory not configured with WebSocket bridge
- Failure Mode: Late validation during execution vs. early validation at startup

This test MUST FAIL initially to demonstrate the bug, then PASS after the fix.
