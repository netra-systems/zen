CRITICAL BUG FIX VERIFICATION: ExecutionEngineFactory WebSocket Bridge Fixed

This test verifies that the original bug has been FIXED. The bug was:
"WebSocket bridge not available in agent factory" in ExecutionEngineFactory._create_user_websocket_emitter()

Fix Applied:
1. ExecutionEngineFactory constructor now requires websocket_bridge parameter  
2. Early validation during initialization (fail fast)
3. WebSocket emitter creation uses validated bridge from initialization
4. System startup configures ExecutionEngineFactory with WebSocket bridge

This test MUST PASS to demonstrate the bug is fixed.
