# Tier 4 - User Management & Auth Red Team Tests

## Overview

These tests are **DESIGNED TO FAIL** initially to expose real vulnerabilities and gaps in user management and authentication systems. Each test focuses on critical security and compliance aspects that directly impact user trust and platform reliability.

## Test Coverage: 66-80

**Test 68: User Data Export for GDPR Compliance**
- Complete user data aggregation
- Privacy-compliant data formats
- Export security and validation

**Test 69: User Account Suspension and Reactivation**
- Graceful service termination
- Data preservation during suspension
- Secure reactivation flows

**Test 70: Cross-Service User Identity Consistency**
- Identity synchronization across microservices
- Data consistency validation
- Service-to-service authentication

### Authentication & Session Management

**Test 71: User Login Audit Trail**
- Comprehensive login logging
- Security event detection
- Audit trail integrity

**Test 72: Password Reset Flow Security**
- Token security and expiration
- Multi-step verification
- Brute force protection

**Test 73: User Session Lifecycle Management**
- Session creation and validation
- Timeout handling
- Concurrent session limits

**Test 74: User Invitation and Onboarding Flow**
- Secure invitation tokens
- Account activation security
- Onboarding data validation

**Test 75: User Profile Data Validation**
- Input sanitization
- XSS and injection prevention
- Data integrity validation

### Advanced Security Features

**Test 76: User Access Token Management**
- Token generation and validation
- Refresh token security
- Token revocation mechanisms

**Test 77: User Activity Tracking for Analytics**
- Privacy-compliant activity logging
- Data anonymization
- Analytics data security

**Test 78: User Deactivation Data Retention Policy**
- GDPR-compliant data deletion
- Retention policy enforcement
- Data anonymization procedures

**Test 79: User Permission Caching and Invalidation**
- Permission cache consistency
- Real-time permission updates
- Cache invalidation strategies

**Test 80: User Merge and Deduplication**
- Duplicate account detection
- Secure account merging
- Data integrity during merge

## Expected Failures

These tests are **designed to fail initially** because:

1. **Security Gaps**: Many security features are not yet implemented
2. **Compliance Issues**: GDPR and privacy controls may be incomplete
3. **Integration Problems**: Cross-service consistency may not be maintained
4. **Performance Issues**: Security operations may not be optimized
5. **Data Integrity**: Complex user management operations may have race conditions

## Business Impact

**Revenue Protection**: User security breaches can result in:
- Customer churn due to security concerns
- Regulatory fines (GDPR: up to 4% of annual revenue)
- Legal liability and reputation damage
- Platform trust degradation

**Compliance Requirements**: Failed compliance tests expose:
- GDPR violation risks
- Data privacy law non-compliance
- Industry regulation gaps
- Audit readiness issues

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all Tier 4 user management tests
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/tier4_user_management/ -v

# Run specific security test categories
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/tier4_user_management/test_user_role_propagation.py -v
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/tier4_user_management/test_gdpr_compliance.py -v
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/tier4_user_management/test_authentication_security.py -v

# Run with detailed failure output
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/tier4_user_management/ -v -s --tb=long
```

## Test Structure

Each test file follows the red team pattern:

```python
"""
RED TEAM TEST XX: [Test Name]

DESIGNED TO FAIL: This test exposes [specific vulnerability]
by testing against real services and databases.

Business Risk: [Revenue/compliance/security impact]
"""

class TestClassName:
    @pytest.mark.asyncio 
    async def test_XX_specific_vulnerability_fails(self):
        """
        DESIGNED TO FAIL: [Explanation of expected failure]
        
        This test WILL FAIL because:
        1. [Specific reason 1]
        2. [Specific reason 2]
        3. [Specific reason 3]
        """
        # Test implementation that exposes real issues
        assert False, "Expected failure message explaining the security gap"
```

## Implementation Priority

After tests fail and expose vulnerabilities:

1. **Immediate (Security Critical)**:
   - Cross-service identity consistency (Test 70)
   - Password reset security (Test 72) 
   - Access token management (Test 76)

2. **High Priority (Compliance)**:
   - GDPR data export (Test 68)
   - Data retention policies (Test 78)
   - Audit trail integrity (Test 71)

3. **Medium Priority (Operational)**:
   - Role propagation (Test 66)
   - Session management (Test 73)
   - Permission caching (Test 79)

4. **Lower Priority (Enhancement)**:
   - Activity tracking (Test 77)
   - User merge/dedup (Test 80)
   - Organization management (Test 67)

## Security Considerations

- **Real Data**: Tests use real databases and services
- **Cleanup**: Proper test data cleanup after each test
- **Isolation**: Tests don't interfere with production data
- **Monitoring**: Security test results are monitored for vulnerabilities

**Remember**: These tests are **DESIGNED TO FAIL** initially. Each failure reveals a real security vulnerability that must be addressed to protect user data and maintain platform trust.
