# RED TEAM TESTING - Tier 2/3: Security, Performance, and Service Degradation

This directory contains **RED TEAM TESTS** that are **DESIGNED TO FAIL INITIALLY** to expose real security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and service degradation issues in the Netra Apex platform.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICE ⚠️

**These tests are EXPECTED TO FAIL on first run.** They are designed to expose real gaps in our system that need to be addressed. Each failure represents a potential production issue that could impact:

- **Customer Security**: Data breaches, unauthorized access
- **Platform Performance**: Poor user experience, resource waste  
- **Operational Reliability**: Undetected failures, poor incident response

**Segment**: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
**Business Goal**: Platform Security, Performance, Reliability, Operational Excellence
**Value Impact**: Security and performance issues directly impact customer trust, platform costs, and competitive positioning
**Strategic Impact**: Essential security, performance, and observability foundation for enterprise AI workload management

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
- Real PostgreSQL database connection
- Real Redis connection (where applicable)
- Real service dependencies running
- Appropriate environment variables set

### Execute Individual Test Categories

```bash
# Security Tests (Tests 26-30)
pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/tier2_3_security_performance/test_input_validation_security.py -v

# Performance Tests (Tests 31-35)  
pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/tier2_3_security_performance/test_performance_bottlenecks.py -v

# Monitoring Tests (Tests 36-40)
pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/tier2_3_security_performance/test_monitoring_observability.py -v
```

### Execute All Tier 2/3 Tests

```bash
pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/tier2_3_security_performance/ -v
```

### Run with Real Services (Recommended)

```bash
# Use real LLM and external services
python unified_test_runner.py --level integration --test-pattern "*tier2_3*" --real-llm
```

## Test Characteristics

### Level 3 Testing (Real Services)
- **Real Database Connections**: Tests use actual PostgreSQL databases
- **Real Service Dependencies**: Auth service, Redis, external APIs
- **Minimal Mocking**: Only mock unavailable external services
- **Real Load Testing**: Actual concurrent operations and resource usage

### Expected Initial Results
- **FAILURE**: Tests are designed to expose real gaps
- **High Error Rate**: 70-90% failure rate expected initially
- **Actionable Issues**: Each failure represents a real production risk

### Performance Criteria
- **Security**: Zero tolerance for vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Response times < 2s, memory usage < 100MB increase
- **Monitoring**: 100% coverage of critical metrics and health checks

## Addressing Failures

When tests fail (expected), follow this process:

1. **Analyze the Specific Failure**
   - Read the test failure message carefully
   - Identify the root cause (missing feature, configuration, etc.)

2. **Prioritize by Business Impact**
   - Security vulnerabilities: **CRITICAL** - Fix immediately
   - Performance issues: **HIGH** - Fix within sprint
   - Monitoring gaps: **MEDIUM** - Fix within release cycle

3. **Implement the Fix**
   - Add missing security controls
   - Optimize database queries and connection pools
   - Implement missing health checks and metrics
   - Add proper configuration validation

4. **Verify the Fix**
   - Re-run the specific test
   - Run related tests to ensure no regressions
   - Update documentation

5. **Update Learnings**
   - Document the issue and fix in `SPEC/learnings/`
   - Update relevant specifications
   - Share learnings with team

## Security Test Patterns

- Checks service boundary consistency

### Authentication & Authorization
- Tests unauthenticated access attempts
- Validates token handling and expiration
- Checks privilege escalation prevention

### Security Headers
- Validates Content Security Policy
- Checks XSS and CSRF protection
- Verifies HTTPS and security headers

## Performance Test Patterns

### Database Performance
- Concurrent query execution
- Connection pool exhaustion
- Query optimization analysis

### Memory Management
- Memory leak detection
- Garbage collection effectiveness
- Resource cleanup validation

### Connection Handling

- Log correlation and performance

### Configuration Management
- Environment variable validation
- Secret security verification  
- Configuration reloading

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests should be integrated into the deployment pipeline:

```bash
# Pre-deployment security validation
python unified_test_runner.py --level integration --test-pattern "*security*" --fail-fast

# Performance regression testing  
python unified_test_runner.py --level integration --test-pattern "*performance*" --benchmark

# Monitoring infrastructure validation
python unified_test_runner.py --level integration --test-pattern "*monitoring*" --env staging
```
