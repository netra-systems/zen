Business Value Integration Tests

This module contains comprehensive integration tests focused on validating
business value delivery for the Netra platform without requiring Docker services.

Test Categories:
- Agent Business Value Delivery (cost optimization, performance analysis, etc.)
- Multi-User Business Operations (concurrent users, isolation, billing)
- Agent Orchestration Value (handoffs, coordination, context preservation)
- WebSocket Business Events (real-time engagement, progress transparency)

All tests use real components (databases, WebSockets, agents) but are configured
for integration testing without external Docker dependencies.
