"""
Test WebSocket Connection State Race Conditions - Critical WebSocket Infrastructure Tests

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Infrastructure
- Business Goal: System Stability & Chat Value Delivery  
- Value Impact: Prevents WebSocket disconnections that break real-time AI interactions
- Strategic Impact: Core infrastructure for chat-based business value delivery

CRITICAL: These tests MUST FAIL initially to reproduce exact "accept first" race conditions.
The goal is to expose timing issues between WebSocket accept(), authentication, and event emission.

Root Cause Analysis:
- Race condition between WebSocket.accept() and WebSocket message handling
- Events sent before connection fully established cause "WebSocket is not connected" errors
- Connection state inconsistency between different components

This test suite creates FAILING scenarios that reproduce production race conditions.
