WebSocket Application State Integration Tests

This module contains comprehensive integration tests for WebSocket connection management
with application state synchronization. These tests validate core WebSocket functionality
while ensuring proper state management and business value delivery.

Test Coverage:
1. Connection establishment with application state validation
2. Authentication flow during connection with user context state  
3. Connection state machine transitions with application state persistence
4. Connection cleanup and resource management with state cleanup
5. Connection health monitoring and heartbeat with application state consistency
6. Connection timeout handling with graceful state preservation
7. Multiple concurrent connection management per user with state isolation
8. Connection metadata tracking and application state correlation
9. Connection event emission and application state notifications
10. Connection error handling with application state recovery

All tests follow CLAUDE.md guidelines and use real services without mocks.
