"""
Database Initializer Error Context Tests - Issue #374

Tests that demonstrate current insufficient error context in database initialization.
These tests SHOULD FAIL initially to prove the issue exists.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/All Users
- Business Goal: Reduce deployment and setup failure diagnosis time
- Value Impact: Reduces infrastructure setup issues from hours to minutes
- Revenue Impact: Prevents service downtime during deployments affecting $500K+ ARR

Test Purpose:
- Demonstrate current insufficient error context in database setup failures
- Validate that initialization errors need detailed diagnostic information
- Show connection string, SSL, and configuration errors lack context
- Prove tests would pass with proper diagnostic error messages

Expected Behavior:
- Tests should FAIL initially due to insufficient error context
- Tests should demonstrate difficulty diagnosing initialization problems  
- Clear path to remediation with enhanced error messages
