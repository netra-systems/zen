"""Security tests for file upload path traversal vulnerability.

Tests to ensure file uploads are properly sandboxed per user and protected

SECURITY VULNERABILITY: MEDIUM severity  
- All users share same upload directory allowing file overwriting/access
- Path traversal attacks possible through filename manipulation
