Infrastructure tests for Docker service management.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform (Infrastructure Management)
- Goal: Stability - Ensure Docker service management prevents test infrastructure failures
- Value Impact: Provides reliable Docker service detection and management
- Revenue Impact: Protects $500K+ ARR by maintaining stable test execution environment

Tests Docker service management, startup detection, and recovery procedures
