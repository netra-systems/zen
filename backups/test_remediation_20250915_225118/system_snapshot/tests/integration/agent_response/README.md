## Test Execution

### Running All Agent Response Tests
```bash
# Run all agent response integration tests
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --path tests/integration/agent_response/ --category integration

# Run with real services (no mocks)
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --path tests/integration/agent_response/ --real-services

# Run specific test file
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --path tests/integration/agent_response/test_agent_response_generation_pipeline.py
```

### Running Individual Test Categories
```bash
# Response generation pipeline
pytest tests/integration/agent_response/test_agent_response_generation_pipeline.py -v

# Response quality validation
pytest tests/integration/agent_response/test_agent_response_quality_validation.py -v

# WebSocket events integration
pytest tests/integration/agent_response/test_agent_websocket_events_integration.py -v
```

## Test Infrastructure

### Base Classes
- **BaseIntegrationTest**: SSOT test base class from `test_framework.ssot.base_test_case`
- **Real Services**: Uses `test_framework.real_services_test_fixtures` for actual service connections
- **Isolated Environment**: All environment access through `shared.isolated_environment.IsolatedEnvironment`

### Key Dependencies
- **User Execution Context**: Uses `netra_backend.app.services.user_execution_context` for secure user isolation
- **Agent Types**: Tests `DataHelperAgent`, `OptimizationsCoreSubAgent`, and base agent patterns
- **WebSocket Integration**: Tests real WebSocket event delivery through `UnifiedWebSocketManager`
- **Execution Tracking**: Validates execution tracking through `get_execution_tracker()`

### Business Value Focus
Every test includes explicit Business Value Justification (BVJ) comments explaining:
1. **Segment**: Which customer segments benefit (Free/Early/Mid/Enterprise/Platform)
2. **Business Goal**: Conversion/Expansion/Retention/Stability objective
3. **Value Impact**: How the test protects business value delivery
4. **Strategic Impact**: Revenue protection and competitive advantage

## Quality Standards

### Test Requirements
- **No Mocks**: Integration tests use real system components, not mocks
- **User Isolation**: All tests validate proper user context isolation
- **Performance**: Tests validate response times meet SLA requirements
- **Error Handling**: All failure scenarios tested with graceful degradation
- **Business Focus**: Every test validates actual business value delivery

### Success Criteria
- **Response Generation**: Agents generate meaningful, contextual responses
