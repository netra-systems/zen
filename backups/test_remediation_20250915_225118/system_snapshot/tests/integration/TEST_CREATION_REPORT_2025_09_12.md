## 🚀 Test Execution Status

### **Current Status: 90% Ready**
- ✅ **Test Collection**: All tests are discoverable by pytest
- ✅ **Test Structure**: Proper pytest markers and categorization
- ✅ **SSOT Integration**: All tests follow established patterns
- ⚠️ **Runtime Issues**: Minor API compatibility fixes needed

### **Sample Test Execution:**
```bash
# All tests are collected successfully
$ python -m pytest tests/integration/agent_responses/ --collect-only
collected 25 items
