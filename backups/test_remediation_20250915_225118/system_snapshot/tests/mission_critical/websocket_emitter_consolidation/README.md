# WebSocket Emitter Consolidation Test Suite

**Mission:** Create comprehensive tests for Issue #200 - Multiple WebSocket event emitters causing race conditions  
**Business Impact:** Protect $500K+ ARR from event delivery failures  
**Constraint:** NO DOCKER TESTS - unit, integration (no docker), or e2e staging GCP only

## Overview

This test suite validates the complete consolidation of multiple WebSocket event emitters into a single SSOT emitter to eliminate race conditions and improve reliability.

### Duplicate Emitters Being Consolidated

1. `/netra_backend/app/websocket_core/unified_emitter.py:137` (intended SSOT)
2. `/netra_backend/app/services/agent_websocket_bridge.py:1752` (bridge duplicate)
3. `/netra_backend/app/agents/base_agent.py:933` (agent-level bypass)
4. `/netra_backend/app/services/websocket/transparent_websocket_events.py:292` (transparency duplicate)

### Critical Events Protected

All tests validate the 5 mission-critical WebSocket events that deliver 90% of business value:
1. **agent_started** - User sees AI began processing
2. **agent_thinking** - Real-time reasoning visibility  
3. **tool_executing** - Tool usage transparency
4. **tool_completed** - Tool results display
5. **agent_completed** - Response ready notification

## Test Suite Structure

### Phase 1: Pre-Consolidation (MUST FAIL)

Tests that prove current issues exist with multiple emitters:

#### `test_multiple_emitter_race_condition_reproduction.py`
- **Purpose:** Reproduce race conditions with concurrent emitter usage
- **Expected Result:** FAIL - Race conditions detected
- **Key Validations:**
  - Timing conflicts between multiple emitters
  - Event delivery reliability failures
  - Resource contention under load
  - Performance degradation with duplicates

#### `test_event_source_validation_fails_with_duplicates.py`
- **Purpose:** Prove multiple event sources violate SSOT principles
- **Expected Result:** FAIL - SSOT violations detected  
- **Key Validations:**

  - Event routing failures due to source confusion
  - Business value degradation from unreliable events
  - Origin tracking inconsistencies

### Phase 2: Consolidation Validation (PASS After Consolidation)

Tests that validate SSOT consolidation works correctly:

#### `test_unified_emitter_ssot_compliance.py`
- **Purpose:** Validate 100% SSOT compliance after consolidation
- **Expected Result:** PASS - Single emitter only
- **Key Validations:**
  - Only unified emitter sends events
  - All critical events delivered reliably
  - No duplicate or missing events
  - Error handling remains robust

#### `test_emitter_consolidation_preserves_golden_path.py`

- **Expected Result:** PASS - Business value maintained
- **Key Validations:**
  - Complete user journey works end-to-end
  - Enterprise customer workflows protected
  - Business value metrics maintained
  - User experience quality preserved

### Phase 3: Post-Consolidation Verification (PASS After Consolidation)

Tests that verify complete elimination of issues:

#### `test_no_race_conditions_single_emitter.py`
- **Purpose:** Prove race conditions eliminated with single emitter
- **Expected Result:** PASS - Zero race conditions
- **Key Validations:**
  - Zero race conditions under high concurrent load
  - Deterministic event ordering maintained
  - User isolation preserved
  - System stability improved

#### `test_single_emitter_performance_validation.py`
- **Purpose:** Validate performance meets/exceeds requirements
- **Expected Result:** PASS - Performance benchmarks met
- **Key Validations:**
  - High throughput (>1000 events/sec)
  - Low latency (<5ms avg, <20ms p99)
  - Memory efficiency under sustained load
  - Scalability with concurrent users

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. **Add pytest markers** to `pytest.ini`:
```ini
markers =
    expected_to_fail: Tests expected to fail pre-consolidation
    phase_1_pre_consolidation: Pre-consolidation tests proving issues
    phase_2_consolidation: Consolidation validation tests
    phase_3_post_consolidation: Post-consolidation verification tests
    websocket_emitter_consolidation: All emitter consolidation tests
    ssot_validation: SSOT compliance validation
    golden_path: Golden Path user flow tests
    race_condition_elimination: Race condition testing
    performance: Performance validation tests
```

2. **Ensure test framework dependencies** are available:
   - `test_framework.ssot.base_test_case`
   - `test_framework.ssot.agent_event_validators`
   - `test_framework.ssot.websocket_golden_path_helpers`

### Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all consolidation tests
pytest tests/mission_critical/websocket_emitter_consolidation/

# Run specific phases
pytest -m "phase_1_pre_consolidation"      # Should FAIL before consolidation
pytest -m "phase_2_consolidation"          # Should PASS after consolidation  
pytest -m "phase_3_post_consolidation"     # Should PASS after consolidation

# Run by test category
pytest -m "expected_to_fail"                # Phase 1 validation
pytest -m "ssot_validation"                # SSOT compliance tests
pytest -m "golden_path"                     # Business value tests
pytest -m "race_condition_elimination"     # Race condition tests
pytest -m "performance"                     # Performance validation

# Run specific test files
pytest tests/mission_critical/websocket_emitter_consolidation/test_multiple_emitter_race_condition_reproduction.py -v
pytest tests/mission_critical/websocket_emitter_consolidation/test_unified_emitter_ssot_compliance.py -v
```

### Test Execution Strategy

1. **Phase 1 First:** Run pre-consolidation tests to establish failure baseline
   ```bash
   pytest -m "phase_1_pre_consolidation" -v
   ```
   - Document specific failure modes
   - Quantify race conditions and SSOT violations
   - Establish business value degradation metrics

2. **Implement Consolidation:** Consolidate to single unified emitter
   - Disable/remove duplicate emitters
   - Route all events through unified emitter
   - Update agent execution patterns

3. **Phase 2 Validation:** Verify consolidation works correctly
   ```bash
   pytest -m "phase_2_consolidation" -v
   ```
   - Confirm 100% SSOT compliance
   - Validate Golden Path preservation
   - Ensure no business value regression

4. **Phase 3 Verification:** Confirm all issues resolved
   ```bash
   pytest -m "phase_3_post_consolidation" -v  
   ```
   - Verify zero race conditions
   - Validate performance improvements
   - Confirm system stability
