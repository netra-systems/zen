        FAILING TESTS for Process Health Monitoring Gaps - Iteration 2

        This test suite addresses the process health monitoring gaps identified
        in iteration 2 dev launcher analysis. These tests focus on the missing
        or inadequate monitoring of process lifecycle, stability, and recovery.

        Key Issues Addressed:
        - Process supervision after launcher timeout
        - Health check timing and reliability
        - Error propagation and diagnostics
        - Recovery mechanism availability

        Business Value Justification (BVJ):
        - Segment: Platform/Internal
        - Business Goal: System Reliability, Operational Efficiency
        - Value Impact: Prevents service downtime, enables proactive issue detection
        - Strategic Impact: Reduces operational costs, improves development velocity
