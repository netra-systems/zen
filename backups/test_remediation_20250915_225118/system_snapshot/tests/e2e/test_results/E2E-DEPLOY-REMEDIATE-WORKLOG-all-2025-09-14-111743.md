## PHASE 2: TEST EXECUTION (STARTING)

### Test Execution Plan:
Based on previous issues and current system status:

```bash
# Step 1: Infrastructure Health Validation
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py

# Step 2: P1 Critical Tests (WebSocket/Agent focus)
python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_priority1_critical_REAL.py -v

# Step 3: Agent Integration Tests (ExecutionEngineFactory import check)
python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_real_agent_*.py -v --tb=short

# Step 4: Authentication Integration 
python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_auth_*.py -v

# Step 5: Comprehensive Staging Tests
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --env staging --category e2e --real-services
```

**Next Action:** Spawn subagent to execute test suite
