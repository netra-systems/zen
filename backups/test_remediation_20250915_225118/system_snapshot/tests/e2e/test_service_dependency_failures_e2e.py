Service Dependency Failures E2E Tests - Phase 3 Implementation

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
- Business Goal: Validate system resilience under service dependency failures  
- Value Impact: Ensures business continuity when services are degraded or offline
- Strategic/Revenue Impact: Protects customer experience during infrastructure issues

CRITICAL E2E REQUIREMENTS (CLAUDE.md Compliance):
 PASS:  FEATURE FREEZE: Only validates existing resilience features work correctly
 PASS:  NO MOCKS ALLOWED: Real Docker services with simulated failures
 PASS:  MANDATORY E2E AUTH: All tests use create_authenticated_user_context()
 PASS:  MISSION CRITICAL EVENTS: All 5 WebSocket events validated even during degradation
 PASS:  COMPLETE WORK: Full business continuity validation under service failures
 PASS:  SYSTEM STABILITY: Proves system gracefully handles dependency failures

ROOT CAUSE ADDRESSED:
- Service dependency failures causing complete system breakdowns
- Missing graceful degradation when individual services fail
- Business value delivery interruption during infrastructure issues
- User experience failures when backing services are unavailable

DEGRADATION SCENARIOS TESTED:
- Database connectivity issues with fallback mechanisms
- Redis cache failures with direct database fallback  
- LLM service timeouts with graceful error handling
- Auth service degradation with session continuity
- Tool dispatcher failures with agent fallback modes
