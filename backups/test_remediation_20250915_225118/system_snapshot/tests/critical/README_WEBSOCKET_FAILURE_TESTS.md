# Critical WebSocket Notification Failure Test Suite

## 🚨 CRITICAL BUSINESS CONTEXT

**These tests are designed to FAIL initially** - they expose critical WebSocket notification issues that could cause complete loss of real-time user feedback in the Netra platform.

### Business Impact
- **Revenue at Risk**: $500K+ ARR from chat functionality (90% of product value)
- **User Experience**: WebSocket failures = user abandonment = churn
- **Security Impact**: Cross-user data leakage = regulatory violations  
- **Reliability Impact**: Silent failures = system appears broken

## 📋 Test Suite Overview

This comprehensive test suite contains **65+ tests** across **5 critical categories**:

### 1. 🌉 Bridge Initialization Failures (15 tests)
**File**: `test_websocket_bridge_initialization_edge_cases.py`

Tests WebSocket bridge initialization edge cases that cause silent notification failures:

- **Bridge becomes None during execution** - Users lose all feedback mid-task
- **Concurrent initialization race conditions** - Random failures for simultaneous users  
- **Bridge timeout under load** - System appears down during peak usage
- **Missing dependency silent failures** - No error handling when components missing
- **State corruption during recovery** - Failed recovery attempts leave users stranded

**Key Failing Test**: `test_bridge_none_causes_silent_notification_failure`
- **Issue**: WebSocket bridge becomes None during agent execution
- **Impact**: Complete loss of real-time feedback - users think system is broken
- **Business Cost**: $50K+ per incident due to user abandonment

### 2. 🔒 Cross-User Security Violations (12 tests) 
**File**: `test_websocket_concurrent_user_security_failures.py`

Tests critical security vulnerabilities in concurrent user scenarios:

- **Shared WebSocket manager data leakage** - User A sees User B's sensitive data
- **Tool execution result contamination** - Cross-user data mixing in results
- **Connection hijacking vulnerabilities** - Attacker receives victim's notifications  
- **Broadcast notification data exposure** - All users receive everyone's private data
- **Session fixation attacks** - Attacker controls victim's session
- **Authentication bypass vulnerabilities** - Unauthorized access to notifications

**Key Failing Test**: `test_shared_websocket_manager_leaks_user_data`
- **Issue**: Shared WebSocket state causes user data to leak between users
- **Impact**: CRITICAL SECURITY BREACH - API keys and private data exposed
- **Regulatory Risk**: GDPR violations, potential $100K+ fines

### 3. ⚡ Performance & Load Failures (8 tests)
**File**: `test_websocket_performance_load_failures.py`

Tests performance degradation and load handling failures:

- **Notification latency degradation** - Response times exceed 500ms under load
- **Memory leaks under sustained load** - Unbounded memory growth causes crashes
- **Connection instability under load** - WebSocket connections drop randomly
- **Thread pool exhaustion** - System can't handle notification bursts
- **Queue overflow causing loss** - Notifications lost when queues fill up
- **High-load connection failures** - New users can't connect during peaks

**Key Failing Test**: `test_notification_delivery_latency_degradation`
- **Issue**: Notification delivery time increases 10x under concurrent load
- **Impact**: System feels laggy and unresponsive during peak usage
- **SLA Violation**: Exceeds 500ms response time guarantee

### 4. 🔄 Reconnection & Recovery Failures (10 tests)
**File**: `test_websocket_reconnection_recovery_failures.py`

Tests WebSocket reconnection and recovery failure scenarios:

- **Notifications lost during reconnection** - Critical updates never delivered
- **Duplicate notifications after reconnect** - Users receive same message multiple times
- **Message ordering corruption** - Updates delivered out of sequence  
- **State corruption during recovery** - User context gets mixed up
- **Buffer overflow during disconnection** - Messages lost when buffer fills
- **Failed reconnection attempts** - Users permanently disconnected
- **Recovery state race conditions** - Concurrent recovery attempts interfere

**Key Failing Test**: `test_notifications_lost_during_reconnection_window`
- **Issue**: Tool progress and completion notifications lost during disconnection
- **Impact**: Users never know if their tasks completed successfully
- **User Experience**: Appears system is broken and unreliable

### 5. 📡 Notification Delivery Failures (20 tests)
**File**: `test_websocket_notification_failures_comprehensive.py`

Tests core notification delivery failure scenarios:

- **Silent failures when bridge is None** - No error handling for missing bridge
- **Cross-user notification routing errors** - Messages go to wrong users
- **Connection loss during tool execution** - Mid-execution communication breakdown
- **Queue overflow causing message loss** - High volume notifications dropped
- **Timeout failures with hanging UI** - Users left waiting indefinitely  
- **No error handling for failed deliveries** - Silent failures with no recovery
- **Retry logic causing duplicates** - Faulty retry creates duplicate messages
- **Race conditions in concurrent scenarios** - Shared state corruption

**Key Failing Test**: `test_websocket_connection_lost_during_tool_execution`
- **Issue**: WebSocket connection lost mid-execution, no notification recovery
- **Impact**: Users left hanging with no feedback on task completion
- **Business Impact**: Poor user experience leads to platform abandonment
