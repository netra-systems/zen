Unit Tests for Issue #1263 - Infrastructure Database Timeout Reproduction

CRITICAL OBJECTIVE: Create tests that FAIL to reproduce the 25.0s database timeout issue
caused by VPC egress configuration and Cloud SQL connectivity failures.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
- Issue #1263: Database connections taking exactly 25.0s timeout
- VPC connector capacity constraints during scaling
- Cloud SQL connection pool exhaustion under load
- Infrastructure timeout escalation patterns

TEST STRATEGY: These tests should initially FAIL to demonstrate the infrastructure problem.
After infrastructure remediation, they should PASS.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Infrastructure
- Business Goal: System Stability & Reliability
- Value Impact: Prevents $500K+ ARR disruption from database timeout cascades
- Strategic Impact: Validates infrastructure resilience for scaling operations
