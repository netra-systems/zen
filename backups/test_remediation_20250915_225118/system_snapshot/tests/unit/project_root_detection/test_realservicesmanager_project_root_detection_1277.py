"""
Unit Tests for RealServicesManager Project Root Detection (Issue #1277)

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal - Development Infrastructure
- Business Goal: Ensure reliable E2E test infrastructure
- Value Impact: Prevents E2E test collection failures that block deployment
- Revenue Impact: Protects release quality and development velocity

This test module validates the fix for Issue #1277 where RealServicesManager
project root detection was updated to use pyproject.toml instead of claude.md,
resolving E2E test collection failures.
