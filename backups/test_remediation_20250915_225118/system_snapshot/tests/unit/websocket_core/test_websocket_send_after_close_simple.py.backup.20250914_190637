"""
Simple Unit Test to Reproduce WebSocket Send-After-Close Race Condition - Issue #335

CRITICAL PURPOSE: This test MUST FAIL to demonstrate the missing validation.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Identify missing "send after close" validation
- Value Impact: Prevents WebSocket errors in Golden Path
- Revenue Impact: Protects $500K+ ARR chat reliability

RACE CONDITION REPRODUCTION:
This test directly tests the missing validation pattern that causes send-after-close errors.
The test should FAIL initially because the system currently lacks proper connection state
validation before sending messages.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: Test FAILS initially, proving race condition exists.

        TEST SHOULD FAIL: Demonstrates missing connection state validation.

        This test reproduces the core issue:
        1. Connection is in CLOSING or CLOSED state
        2. send_json() is called without state validation
        3. No error is raised (missing validation)
        4. In production, this causes send-after-close exceptions
