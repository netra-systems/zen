Test ExecutionState SSOT Consolidation - Issue #305

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
- Business Goal: Prevent agent execution failures that block chat functionality
- Value Impact: Agents must execute reliably to deliver 90% of platform value
- Revenue Impact: $500K+ ARR protection through reliable agent state management

CRITICAL ISSUE: #305 - ExecutionTracker dict/enum conflicts
ROOT CAUSE: Dict objects being passed where ExecutionState enum expected
BUSINESS IMPACT: Agent execution failures = no chat value = revenue loss
