"""
Test WebSocket Event Routing SSOT Violations

Focus: WebSocket event delivery consistency and routing consolidation
Purpose: This test file is designed to FAIL initially to demonstrate current
WebSocket event routing SSOT violations. After consolidation, all tests should PASS.

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: Platform Infrastructure
- Business Goal: Chat Functionality Reliability ($500K+ ARR protection)
- Value Impact: Ensure all 5 critical WebSocket events work consistently
- Strategic Impact: User experience consistency and system stability
