   - Disconnect from Location A
   - Simulate IP change to 10.0.0.50
   - Modify user-agent and geolocation headers
   - Wait brief network transition period

3. **Reconnection from Location B:**
   - Connect with same session token, new IP
   - Verify session recognition despite IP change
   - Request context restoration

4. **Cross-Location Validation:**
