# Category 5: Security and Permissions Enforcement Test Plan

## Executive Summary

**Business Value Justification (BVJ)**:
- **Segment**: Enterprise, Mid, Early
- **Business Goal**: Risk Reduction, Compliance, Trust
- **Value Impact**: Prevents data breaches, ensures tenant isolation, enables enterprise adoption
- **Revenue Impact**: Critical for enterprise sales, compliance requirements, regulatory adherence

## Test Overview

Category 5 focuses on comprehensive security and permissions enforcement across the Netra Apex platform. These tests validate that security boundaries are properly implemented and enforced, protecting against common attack vectors and ensuring proper isolation between tenants and user tiers.

## Security Framework Analysis

### Current Security Architecture
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 + JWT tokens via independent auth service
- **Authorization**: Role-based permissions with tier-based feature gating
- **Tenant Isolation**: User-based data separation in multi-tenant architecture
- **Admin Tools**: Permission-based access to administrative functions
- **PII/Secrets**: Encrypted storage and controlled access patterns

### Tier Structure
- **Free**: Basic features, limited usage, read-only access
- **Pro**: Enhanced features, higher limits, some admin tools
- **Enterprise**: Full features, unlimited usage, full admin access
- **Developer**: Special tier with debug tools and system access

## Test Categories

### 1. Tenant Isolation and IDOR Prevention
**Objective**: Ensure users cannot access data belonging to other tenants

**Attack Vectors**:
- Direct ID manipulation in API requests
- JWT token manipulation
- Cross-tenant data leakage through shared resources
- Permission escalation through crafted requests

### 2. Admin Tool Authorization
**Objective**: Validate proper access control for administrative functions

**Components Tested**:
- Admin tool dispatcher permission validation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Permission inheritance and delegation
- Audit trail for admin actions

### 3. Tier-Based Feature Gating
**Objective**: Ensure features are properly restricted by subscription tier

**Feature Gates**:
- Agent execution limits
- API rate limiting by tier
- Feature availability enforcement
- Usage quota validation

### 4. JWT Security and Token Validation
**Objective**: Validate JWT security implementation

**Security Aspects**:
- Token signature validation
- Expiration enforcement
- Cross-service token consistency
- Token tampering detection

### 5. PII and Secret Protection
**Objective**: Ensure sensitive data is properly protected

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- Encrypted storage validation
- Access pattern enforcement
- Data masking in logs
- Secure transmission validation

## Test Implementation Plan

### Test 1: Tenant Isolation (IDOR Prevention)
```python
class TestTenantIsolation:
    async def test_user_data_isolation(self):
        """Test that users cannot access other users' data"""
        # Create two separate users with different tenants
        # Attempt cross-tenant data access
        # Verify access is denied and audit logged
        
    async def test_workspace_isolation(self):
        """Test workspace-level data isolation"""
        # Create workspaces for different users
        # Attempt unauthorized workspace access
        # Verify proper isolation boundaries
```

### Test 2: Admin Tool Authorization
```python
class TestAdminToolAuthorization:
    async def test_admin_tool_access_control(self):
        """Test admin tool permission enforcement"""
        # Test access with different permission levels
        # Validate proper admin tool dispatcher behavior
        # Verify audit trail generation
        
    async def test_role_based_permission_enforcement(self):
        """Test RBAC implementation"""
        # Test different role combinations
        # Validate permission inheritance
        # Verify least privilege principle
```

### Test 3: Tier-Based Feature Gating
```python
class TestTierBasedFeatureGating:
    async def test_feature_availability_by_tier(self):
        """Test feature access based on subscription tier"""
        # Test each tier's feature access
        # Validate proper feature gating
        # Verify upgrade/downgrade scenarios
        
    async def test_usage_quota_enforcement(self):
        """Test usage limits by tier"""
        # Test rate limiting by tier
        # Validate quota enforcement
        # Verify graceful limit handling
```

### Test 4: JWT Security
```python
class TestJWTSecurity:
    async def test_token_tampering_detection(self):
        """Test JWT tampering detection"""
        # Modify JWT signatures and claims
        # Verify tampering is detected
        # Validate security response
        
    async def test_cross_service_token_validation(self):
        """Test token validation across services"""
        # Validate token consistency
        # Test service-to-service auth
        # Verify proper token propagation
```

### Test 5: PII and Secret Protection
```python
class TestPIISecretProtection:
    async def test_sensitive_data_encryption(self):
        """Test encryption of sensitive data"""
        # Validate data encryption at rest
        # Test secure transmission
        # Verify key management
        
    async def test_data_masking_and_logging(self):
        """Test PII masking in logs and responses"""
        # Verify sensitive data is masked
        # Test log sanitization
        # Validate compliance patterns
```

## Success Criteria

### Critical Security Requirements
1. **Zero IDOR vulnerabilities**: No user can access another user's data
2. **Proper admin authorization**: Admin tools require appropriate permissions
3. **Tier enforcement**: Features properly gated by subscription tier
4. **JWT integrity**: Token tampering is detected and blocked
5. **PII protection**: Sensitive data is encrypted and masked

### Performance Requirements
- Security checks add <50ms to request latency
- Permission validation scales to 1000+ concurrent users
- Audit logging doesn't impact primary operations

### Compliance Requirements
- SOC 2 Type II compliance patterns
- GDPR data protection requirements
- Enterprise security standards
- Audit trail completeness

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Cross-tenant data leakage**: Critical business risk
