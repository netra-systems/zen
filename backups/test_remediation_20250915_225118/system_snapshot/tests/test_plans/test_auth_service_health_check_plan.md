# Test Suite Implementation Plan: Auth Service Health Check Integration

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Test 1: Health Ready Endpoint Validation
- Verify /health/ready endpoint responds on port 8080
- Test response format and status codes
- Validate response time <1s requirement
- Test with and without database connectivity

### Test 2: Lazy Database Initialization
- Test health check with uninitialized async_engine
- Verify lazy loading on first auth request
- Ensure health check doesn't trigger DB initialization
- Test graceful handling of uninitialized state

### Test 3: Database Recovery Scenarios
- Simulate database outage
- Test health check during outage
- Verify recovery after DB comes back
- Test health status transitions

### Test 4: Service Dependencies
- Test health check with missing dependencies
- Verify partial health status reporting
- Test dependency timeout handling
- Validate cascading health impacts

### Test 5: Performance Under Load
- Test concurrent health check requests
- Verify <1s response under load
- Test health check during auth operations
- Validate no performance degradation

## Implementation Requirements
- Use async/await for all operations
- Mock database states for isolation
- Include performance benchmarks
- Follow AAA pattern
- Include BVJ documentation
- Maximum 300 lines per test file
- Business Impact: $145K+ MRR (auth service availability)
