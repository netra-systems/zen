SSOT Agent Registry Consolidation Validation Tests

Issue #845: Critical P0 test suite for validating AgentRegistry SSOT consolidation
Business Impact: $500K+ ARR Golden Path protection (login → AI responses)

Tests duplicate AgentRegistry consolidation from:
- Basic: /netra_backend/app/agents/registry.py (419 lines) → TO BE ELIMINATED
- Advanced: /netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/agent_registry.py (1,817 lines) → SSOT TARGET

Created: 2025-01-13 - SSOT Gardner agents focus
Priority: P0 (Critical/Blocking) - Must pass before consolidation
