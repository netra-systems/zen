## Test Categories Overview

### Category 1: Concurrent User Execution Isolation (3 Tests)
**Purpose:** Validate that 10+ concurrent users don't share execution state
**Expected Failures:**
- WebSocketManager singleton shares state across all users
- AgentExecutionRegistry singleton creates execution conflicts
- AgentWebSocketBridge singleton mixes user notifications

**Key Test:** `test_concurrent_user_execution_isolation()`
- 12 concurrent users executing simultaneously
- Detects data leakage between user sessions
- Validates component instance isolation

### Category 2: WebSocket Event User Isolation (2 Tests)  
**Purpose:** Ensure WebSocket events only reach intended users
**Expected Failures:**
- Singleton WebSocket manager broadcasts events to all users
- Agent death notifications sent to wrong users

**Key Test:** `test_websocket_event_user_isolation()`
- 15 concurrent users with user-specific events
- Validates event routing accuracy
- Detects cross-user event contamination

### Category 3: Factory Pattern Validation (3 Tests)
**Purpose:** Validate factory functions return unique instances
**Expected Failures:**
- `get_websocket_manager()` returns same singleton instance
- `get_agent_websocket_bridge()` returns shared instance
- `get_agent_execution_registry()` returns singleton

**Validation Confirmed:** Factory test shows singleton behavior works as expected:
```
Factory returned shared instances: 5 calls, 1 unique instances
Instance IDs: [2398240469792, 2398240469792, 2398240469792, ...]
```

### Category 4: Memory Leak Prevention (2 Tests)
**Purpose:** Validate bounded memory growth with concurrent users
**Expected Failures:**
- Singleton WebSocket manager accumulates unbounded memory
- Per-user state accumulates globally instead of being cleanable

**Key Test:** `test_websocket_manager_memory_bounds()`
- Tests memory growth after 100 user connections
- Validates proper cleanup and garbage collection

### Category 5: Race Condition Protection (2 Tests)
**Purpose:** Ensure concurrent modifications don't create race conditions  
**Expected Failures:**
- Shared singleton state creates race conditions
- Concurrent WebSocket operations interfere

**Key Test:** `test_concurrent_websocket_modifications()`
- 20 users performing rapid connect/disconnect operations
- Detects race condition errors in shared state

### Category 6: Performance Under Load (2 Tests)
**Purpose:** Validate linear performance scaling with user count
**Expected Failures:**
- Singleton bottlenecks cause exponential performance degradation
- Memory usage grows super-linearly with user count

**Key Test:** `test_concurrent_user_performance_degradation()`
- Tests performance with 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 users
- Measures response time degradation ratios

### Category 7: Comprehensive Validation (1 Test)
**Purpose:** Combine all singleton issues in realistic workflow
**Expected Failures:** 
- Multiple singleton issues compound under load
- System cannot support concurrent users in production

**Key Test:** `test_comprehensive_singleton_removal_validation()`
- 25 users with complete agent execution workflows
- Tests all singleton issues simultaneously
- Ultimate validation of concurrent user support

## Validation Results with Current Architecture

### Factory Uniqueness Test Results
```bash
Factory uniqueness test result: False
Issues found: ['Factory returned shared instances: 5 calls, 1 unique instances']
Instance IDs: [same_id, same_id, same_id, same_id, same_id]
```

This confirms the singleton pattern is working as expected in the current architecture.

### Mock User Creation Test Results
```bash
Created 3 mock users successfully
  - user_0_207aeab2: thread_0_aad2c684
  - user_1_fa7a40a2: thread_1_32e08e40  
  - user_2_486fd20b: thread_2_e28627c4
```

This confirms the test infrastructure is working correctly.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive test suite provides the definitive validation framework for singleton removal work. It serves as both:

1. **Requirements Definition:** Precisely defines what concurrent user isolation means
2. **Implementation Validation:** Verifies singleton removal work is complete and correct

The test suite is designed to fail comprehensively with the current singleton architecture, providing clear guidance on what needs to be fixed and serving as the success criteria for the singleton removal implementation.

**All tests are expected to fail until singleton patterns are properly replaced with factory patterns that support concurrent user isolation.**
