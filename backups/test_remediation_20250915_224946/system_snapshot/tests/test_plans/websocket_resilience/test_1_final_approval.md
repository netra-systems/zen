## Remaining Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### Identified Risks (Low Impact)

#### 1. Mock Test Coverage Limitation 
**Risk Level: LOW**
- Current implementation relies heavily on mocks vs real WebSocket integration
- **Mitigation**: Implemented hybrid approach allowing both mock and real connections
- **Action**: Monitor production metrics for any mock-reality gaps

#### 2. Performance Baseline Dependencies
**Risk Level: LOW**  
- Some performance assertions use environment-dependent baselines
- **Mitigation**: Percentile-based validation with confidence intervals
- **Action**: Establish production performance baselines for continuous monitoring

#### 3. Error Scenario Coverage
**Risk Level: LOW**
- Advanced failure scenarios (server restart, database failures) not fully tested
- **Mitigation**: Production monitoring and alerting will detect edge cases
- **Action**: Implement additional failure injection testing in future iterations

### Risk Mitigation Rating: 9/10 - Well-controlled risk profile
