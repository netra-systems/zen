# WebSocket Test 2: Mid-Stream Disconnection and Recovery Plan

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)
- **Segment:** Enterprise, Growth
- **Business Goal:** Retention, Platform Stability  
- **Value Impact:** Ensures agents can resume complex responses after network drops, preventing workflow interruption and customer frustration
- **Strategic/Revenue Impact:** Prevents $75K+ MRR churn from mid-stream failures, ensures 99.95% response delivery guarantee

## Test Objective
Validate that network drops while the agent is actively streaming a response preserves agent state and the response resumes or re-delivers upon reconnection.

## Technical Requirements
Based on `SPEC/websocket_reliability.xml` patterns:
- **Transactional Message Processing:** Never lose partial responses during network failures
- **Atomic State Management:** Agent state must remain consistent during stream interruptions  
- **Explicit Exception Handling:** All network failures must be detected and handled explicitly
- **Independent Monitoring:** Stream health must be monitored independently of connection health

## Test Scope

### Core Test Cases (5 Primary)

#### Test Case 1: Disconnection During Text Streaming Response
- **Scenario:** Agent streaming long-form text response when network drops
- **Validation:** 
  - Partial response preserved in buffer
  - Response resumes from correct position on reconnection
  - No text duplication or corruption
  - Total response time < baseline + 5 seconds

#### Test Case 2: Disconnection During JSON Data Streaming  
- **Scenario:** Agent streaming structured JSON data when connection fails
- **Validation:**
  - JSON structure integrity maintained
  - Partial objects properly handled 
  - Complete data delivered after reconnection
  - Schema validation passes on final response

#### Test Case 3: Disconnection During Multi-Part Response Delivery
- **Scenario:** Agent delivering response with multiple components (text + data + visualizations)
- **Validation:**
  - Each component delivery tracked independently
  - Missing components identified and re-sent
  - Component ordering preserved
  - No duplicate components delivered

#### Test Case 4: Recovery with Partial Message Buffer Preservation
- **Scenario:** Network drop mid-stream with data in multiple buffers
- **Validation:**
  - All buffer states preserved during disconnection
  - Buffer synchronization maintained on reconnection
  - Message sequence numbers preserved
  - No buffer overflow or underflow

#### Test Case 5: Timeout and Retry Mechanisms
- **Scenario:** Multiple failed reconnection attempts during active stream
- **Validation:**
  - Exponential backoff implemented correctly
  - Maximum retry attempts respected  
  - Graceful degradation after timeout
  - Clear error messages to client

### Extended Test Cases (10 Additional)

#### Test Case 6: Rapid Reconnection During Stream Start
- **Scenario:** Disconnect within first 100ms of response streaming
- **Validation:** Full response delivery with minimal delay

#### Test Case 7: Cascading Connection Failures
- **Scenario:** Multiple connection drops in rapid succession
- **Validation:** State consistency maintained across all failures

#### Test Case 8: Large Response Stream Interruption  
- **Scenario:** 10MB+ response interrupted at various completion percentages
- **Validation:** Efficient resume without full retransmission

#### Test Case 9: Concurrent Stream Interruptions
- **Scenario:** Multiple agents streaming responses simultaneously during network event
- **Validation:** All streams handle interruption independently

#### Test Case 10: Authentication Token Expiry During Stream
- **Scenario:** JWT expires mid-stream requiring re-authentication
- **Validation:** Seamless token refresh without losing stream state

#### Test Case 11: Browser Tab Suspension/Wake During Stream
- **Scenario:** Browser suspends WebSocket connection mid-stream
- **Validation:** Stream resumes when tab becomes active

#### Test Case 12: Network Quality Degradation
- **Scenario:** Gradually decreasing network quality during stream
- **Validation:** Adaptive quality adjustments without interruption

#### Test Case 13: Server-Side Resource Exhaustion
- **Scenario:** Server temporarily unable to continue stream due to load
- **Validation:** Graceful degradation and retry with backoff

#### Test Case 14: Protocol Upgrade Mid-Stream
- **Scenario:** WebSocket protocol version change during active stream
- **Validation:** Backwards compatibility maintained

#### Test Case 15: Cross-Origin Policy Changes
- **Scenario:** CORS policy changes affecting active connections
- **Validation:** Existing streams unaffected by policy updates

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Targets
- **Reconnection Time:** < 2 seconds for < 1MB partial response
- **Stream Resume Time:** < 500ms from reconnection to resume
- **Complete Recovery Time:** < 5 seconds total (disconnect to completion)
- **Memory Overhead:** < 50MB for buffered response data

### Reliability Targets  
- **Stream Completion Rate:** 99.95% across all scenarios
- **Data Integrity Rate:** 100% (zero corruption tolerance)
- **Recovery Success Rate:** 99.9% for network failures

## Test Data & Scenarios

### Response Size Categories
- **Small:** 1KB - 10KB (typical chat responses)
- **Medium:** 10KB - 100KB (detailed analysis responses) 
- **Large:** 100KB - 1MB (comprehensive reports)
- **Extra Large:** 1MB - 10MB (data exports, visualizations)

### Network Conditions
- **Clean Disconnect:** Immediate connection closure
- **Gradual Degradation:** Increasing latency before failure
- **Intermittent Drops:** Multiple brief disconnections
- **Complete Outage:** Extended network unavailability
- **Asymmetric Failure:** Receive-only or send-only failures

### Timing Scenarios
- **Immediate:** Disconnect within 100ms of stream start
- **Early:** Disconnect at 10-25% completion
- **Mid-Stream:** Disconnect at 40-60% completion  
- **Late:** Disconnect at 75-90% completion
- **Final Moment:** Disconnect at 95%+ completion
