# Test 8: Invalid/Malformed Payload Handling - Test Plan

## Overview
**Test ID**: WS-RESILIENCE-008  
**Test Type**: WebSocket Security & Resilience  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Duration**: 45 seconds  

## Objective
Validate server handling of oversized and malformed JSON payloads to ensure proper error handling and DoS prevention mechanisms are in place.

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)
- **Segment**: Enterprise (security-critical environments requiring DoS protection)
- **Business Goal**: Security and stability under malicious/accidental payload attacks
- **Value Impact**: Prevents service disruption and maintains system availability
- **Strategic Impact**: Protects $200K+ MRR from security-related downtime and ensures enterprise compliance

## Test Scenario
Test server resilience against various payload attack vectors:
1. Oversized JSON payloads (>1MB, >10MB)
2. Malformed JSON structures
3. Deeply nested JSON objects
4. Invalid UTF-8 sequences
5. Rapid payload bombardment (DoS simulation)

## Test Steps

### Setup Phase
1. Configure payload size limits and validation rules
2. Start backend server with security monitoring
3. Initialize attack simulation capabilities

### Execution Phase
1. **Oversized Payload Test**:
   - Send 1MB, 5MB, 10MB JSON payloads
   - Verify size limit enforcement
   - Check proper error responses

2. **Malformed JSON Test**:
   - Send invalid JSON syntax
   - Test unclosed brackets, quotes
   - Verify parsing error handling

3. **Deep Nesting Attack**:
   - Send deeply nested JSON (1000+ levels)
   - Test stack overflow protection
   - Verify resource usage bounds

4. **Invalid Encoding Test**:
   - Send invalid UTF-8 sequences
   - Test binary data injection
   - Verify encoding validation

5. **DoS Simulation**:
   - Rapid-fire malformed payloads
   - Test rate limiting effectiveness
   - Verify server stability

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Oversized payloads rejected with proper error codes
- ✅ Malformed JSON handled gracefully without crashes
- ✅ Deep nesting attacks prevented or limited
- ✅ Invalid encoding detected and rejected
- ✅ DoS attacks mitigated through rate limiting
- ✅ Server remains stable and responsive
- ✅ Memory usage stays within bounds

## Risk Assessment
- **High**: Potential for server crashes or memory exhaustion
- **High**: DoS vulnerability if not properly handled
- **Medium**: Resource exhaustion from parsing attacks

## Implementation Notes
- Use memory monitoring during payload tests
- Implement comprehensive error response validation
- Test both individual and rapid-fire attack scenarios
- Monitor server performance throughout testing

## Expected Outcomes
- Robust payload validation prevents security vulnerabilities
- Proper error handling maintains service availability
- Resource limits prevent system exhaustion
- Rate limiting protects against DoS attacks
