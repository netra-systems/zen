# Test 9: Network Interface Switching - Test Plan

## Overview
**Test ID**: WS-RESILIENCE-009  
**Test Type**: WebSocket Network Resilience  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Duration**: 40 seconds  

## Objective
Simulate client switching networks (WiFi to Cellular) and verify seamless continuation with new IP address without disrupting the WebSocket session.

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)
- **Segment**: Enterprise (mobile workforce, hybrid environments)
- **Business Goal**: Seamless connectivity for mobile users
- **Value Impact**: Prevents session disruption during network transitions
- **Strategic Impact**: Enables $100K+ MRR from mobile enterprise customers

## Test Scenario
Validate network interface switching by testing:
1. Connection establishment on primary network
2. Simulated network interface change (IP address change)
3. Seamless session continuation without reconnection
4. Message delivery across network transitions
5. Connection state preservation

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Session continues after IP address change
- ✅ No message loss during transition
- ✅ Connection state preserved
- ✅ Transparent network switching
- ✅ Sub-second transition time

## Implementation Notes
- Mock network interface changes
- Simulate IP address transitions
- Validate session continuity
- Test message delivery reliability
