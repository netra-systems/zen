# WebSocket Test 4: Reconnection with Expired Token - Test Plan

## Executive Summary

**Business Value Justification (BVJ):**
- **Segment:** Enterprise
- **Business Goal:** Security Compliance & Risk Reduction
- **Value Impact:** Prevents unauthorized access and potential security breaches that could cost $500K+ in compliance violations and customer trust erosion
- **Strategic Impact:** Ensures SOC 2 compliance and enterprise security requirements for customer retention

## Security-First Testing Philosophy

This test suite focuses on validating that expired JWT tokens are properly rejected during WebSocket reconnection attempts, preventing session hijacking, token replay attacks, and unauthorized access to sensitive AI workloads.

## Test Scenarios Overview

### 1. Core Expired Token Rejection Tests
- **Test 1:** Basic expired token rejection with clear error messaging
- **Test 2:** Grace period handling for recently expired tokens
- **Test 3:** Token refresh prompt and automated flow validation
- **Test 4:** Security logging and audit trail verification
- **Test 5:** Session hijacking prevention with old tokens

### 2. Edge Case and Attack Vector Tests
- **Test 6:** Multiple expired token attempts (brute force protection)
- **Test 7:** Malformed expired token handling
- **Test 8:** Clock synchronization edge cases
- **Test 9:** Concurrent expired token requests
- **Test 10:** Token tampering with expired timestamps

## Detailed Test Case Specifications

### Test Case 1: Basic Expired Token Rejection
**Objective:** Validate that expired JWT tokens are immediately rejected during WebSocket connection attempts.

**Security Requirements:**
- Expired tokens MUST be rejected within 100ms
- Clear error message MUST be returned (no information leakage)
- Connection MUST be terminated immediately
- No partial access or degraded mode allowed

**Test Steps:**
1. Create valid JWT token with short expiration (1 second)
2. Wait for token to expire
3. Attempt WebSocket connection with expired token
4. Verify immediate rejection with appropriate error code
5. Validate no connection state is established

**Expected Results:**
- WebSocket connection rejected with `401 Unauthorized`
- Error message: "Authentication failed: Token expired"
- Connection closed within 100ms
- No WebSocket session established
- Security event logged

### Test Case 2: Grace Period Handling
**Objective:** Test system behavior for tokens that expire during active sessions vs. reconnection attempts.

**Security Requirements:**
- Grace period MUST NOT exceed 30 seconds
- Grace period ONLY applies to active sessions, not new connections
- Clear distinction between active session expiry and reconnection expiry

**Test Steps:**
1. Establish WebSocket connection with valid token
2. Let token expire during active session
3. Test continued functionality within grace period
4. Attempt reconnection after token expiry (should fail)
5. Validate grace period does not apply to new connections

### Test Case 3: Token Refresh Prompt and Flow
**Objective:** Validate proper token refresh mechanisms when expired tokens are detected.

**Security Requirements:**
- Refresh flow MUST be secure (no token leakage)
- Old tokens MUST be invalidated after refresh
- Refresh tokens MUST have limited scope and lifetime

**Test Steps:**
1. Create token near expiration
2. Attempt connection as token expires
3. Verify refresh prompt is triggered
4. Execute token refresh flow
5. Validate new token allows connection
6. Verify old token is permanently invalidated

### Test Case 4: Security Logging and Audit Trail
**Objective:** Ensure comprehensive security logging for expired token attempts.

**Security Requirements:**
- All expired token attempts MUST be logged
- Logs MUST include: timestamp, source IP, user ID, token fingerprint
- Log entries MUST be tamper-evident
- Suspicious patterns MUST trigger alerts

**Test Steps:**
1. Generate multiple expired token scenarios
2. Attempt connections with various expired tokens
3. Verify comprehensive audit logging
4. Validate log entry completeness and accuracy
5. Test alert triggering for repeated attempts

### Test Case 5: Session Hijacking Prevention
**Objective:** Validate protection against session hijacking with expired tokens.

**Security Requirements:**
- Expired tokens MUST NOT provide any access
- Token replay attacks MUST be detected and blocked
- Session state MUST be completely cleared on token expiry

**Test Steps:**
1. Capture valid token during active session
2. Allow token to expire
3. Attempt session hijacking with expired token
4. Verify complete access denial
5. Validate session state cleanup

## Security Attack Vectors Tested

### 1. Token Replay Attacks
- Intercepted expired tokens used for unauthorized access
- Validation that expired tokens provide zero access

### 2. Time Manipulation Attacks
- Clock skew exploitation attempts
- Server-side time validation enforcement

### 3. Brute Force Protection
- Multiple rapid expired token attempts
- Rate limiting and account protection mechanisms

### 4. Information Disclosure
- Error message analysis for sensitive information leakage
- Token fingerprinting prevention

## Performance Security Requirements

### Response Time Security
- Token validation MUST complete within 100ms
- Expired token rejection MUST be immediate (no delayed responses that could indicate timing attacks)

### Resource Protection
- Expired token processing MUST NOT consume excessive resources
- Protection against DoS via expired token flooding

### Memory Security
- Expired tokens MUST NOT be cached or stored
- Immediate cleanup of rejected connection attempts

## Compliance Validation

### SOC 2 Requirements
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Access control validation
- Security monitoring capabilities

### Enterprise Security Standards
- Token lifecycle management
- Session security controls
- Incident response capabilities

## Test Environment Security Configuration

### Mock Security Services
- JWT validation service with configurable expiration
- Audit logging service with tamper detection
- Rate limiting service for attack protection

### Security Test Fixtures
- Expired token generators with various scenarios
- Security event simulators
- Attack pattern generators

## Success Criteria

### Functional Security
- 100% expired token rejection rate
- Zero false positives for valid tokens
- Complete session isolation

### Performance Security
- Sub-100ms token validation
- No resource exhaustion under load
- Consistent response times (no timing attack vectors)

### Audit and Compliance
- Complete audit trail for all attempts
- Real-time security alerting
- Compliance report generation

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Security Risks
1. **Information Leakage:** Error messages revealing system internals
2. **Timing Attacks:** Response time variations indicating valid vs invalid tokens
3. **Resource Exhaustion:** DoS via expired token flooding
4. **Session Persistence:** Expired tokens maintaining partial access

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Standardized error responses with no internal information
2. Consistent response timing regardless of token validity
3. Rate limiting and resource protection mechanisms
4. Complete session cleanup on token expiry

## Test Execution Security

### Security Isolation
- Tests run in isolated security contexts
- No production token exposure in test environment
- Secure test data generation and cleanup

### Validation Security
- Test results verified through multiple security controls
- Independent security validation of test outcomes
- Penetration testing validation of implemented controls

This test plan ensures comprehensive validation of expired token handling while maintaining strict security controls and compliance requirements.
