# Test 6: Rapid Reconnection (Flapping) - Test Plan

## Overview
**Test ID**: WS-RESILIENCE-006  
**Test Type**: WebSocket Resilience  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Duration**: 45 seconds  

## Objective
Simulate unstable network conditions with rapid connects/disconnects (flapping) to verify server handling without duplicating agent instances or causing resource leaks.

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)
- **Segment**: Enterprise (unstable corporate networks, mobile users)
- **Business Goal**: Reliability and resource optimization
- **Value Impact**: Prevents server resource exhaustion during network instability
- **Strategic Impact**: Reduces infrastructure costs and ensures consistent performance

## Test Scenario
Simulate network flapping by rapidly connecting and disconnecting a WebSocket client to test:
1. Server prevents duplicate agent instance creation
2. Proper cleanup of disconnected sessions
3. Resource leak prevention
4. Connection state management during rapid state changes

## Test Steps

### Setup Phase
1. Start backend server with WebSocket endpoint
2. Create authenticated user session
3. Initialize connection tracking mechanisms

### Execution Phase
1. **Rapid Connection Cycle** (20 iterations):
   - Connect WebSocket
   - Wait 100ms
   - Disconnect WebSocket
   - Wait 50ms
   - Repeat cycle

2. **Agent Instance Verification**:
   - Monitor server-side agent instances
   - Verify no duplicate agents created
   - Check proper cleanup occurs

3. **Resource Monitoring**:
   - Track memory usage during flapping
   - Monitor connection pool status
   - Verify proper resource cleanup

4. **Final Stability Test**:
   - Establish stable connection after flapping
   - Send test message to verify functionality
   - Confirm normal operation resumed

## Success Criteria
- ✅ No duplicate agent instances created during flapping
- ✅ Memory usage remains stable (no leaks)
- ✅ Connection pool properly manages rapid state changes
- ✅ Final connection works normally after flapping period
- ✅ Server logs show proper cleanup for each disconnect
- ✅ No resource exhaustion or server instability

## Risk Assessment
- **High**: Potential for resource leaks
- **Medium**: Server instability under rapid connection changes
- **Low**: Impact on other concurrent connections

## Implementation Notes
- Use asyncio.sleep() for precise timing control
- Monitor server-side connection tracking
- Implement connection state verification
- Track resource usage patterns

## Expected Outcomes
- Server maintains stability during network flapping
- Proper resource management prevents leaks
- Connection handling is robust and efficient
- System recovers quickly to normal operation
