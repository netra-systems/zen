# Test 7: WebSocket Heartbeat Validation - Test Plan

## Overview
**Test ID**: WS-RESILIENCE-007  
**Test Type**: WebSocket Resilience  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Duration**: 60 seconds  

## Objective
Verify Ping/Pong mechanism implementation to detect zombie connections and ensure proper connection health monitoring and termination of unresponsive connections.

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)
- **Segment**: Enterprise (reliable connection monitoring for mission-critical operations)
- **Business Goal**: Connection reliability and resource optimization
- **Value Impact**: Prevents resource waste from zombie connections and ensures real-time communication reliability
- **Strategic Impact**: Reduces server costs by 15-25% through efficient connection management

## Test Scenario
Validate WebSocket heartbeat mechanism by testing:
1. Normal ping/pong exchange functionality
2. Detection of unresponsive connections (zombies)
3. Automatic termination of zombie connections
4. Heartbeat interval configuration and timing
5. Recovery after heartbeat restoration

## Test Steps

### Setup Phase
1. Start backend server with WebSocket heartbeat enabled
2. Configure heartbeat intervals (ping: 30s, timeout: 10s)
3. Create multiple test connections with different response behaviors

### Execution Phase
1. **Normal Heartbeat Test**:
   - Establish WebSocket connection
   - Verify automatic ping messages sent by server
   - Respond with pong messages
   - Confirm connection remains active

2. **Zombie Detection Test**:
   - Establish connection that stops responding to pings
   - Monitor server-side zombie detection
   - Verify automatic connection termination
   - Check cleanup of associated resources

3. **Heartbeat Timing Test**:
   - Verify ping intervals match configuration
   - Test timeout threshold enforcement
   - Validate timing accuracy under load

4. **Recovery Test**:
   - Simulate temporary unresponsiveness
   - Resume pong responses before timeout
   - Verify connection continues normally

5. **Multi-Connection Stress Test**:
   - Create multiple connections with mixed behaviors
   - Some responsive, some zombies
   - Verify selective zombie termination
   - Confirm healthy connections unaffected

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Ping messages sent at correct intervals
- ✅ Pong responses properly received and processed
- ✅ Zombie connections detected within timeout period
- ✅ Automatic termination of unresponsive connections
- ✅ Resource cleanup after zombie termination
- ✅ Healthy connections remain unaffected
- ✅ Timing accuracy within ±2 seconds

## Risk Assessment
- **High**: Incorrect timeout values could affect active connections
- **Medium**: Resource leaks from failed zombie cleanup
- **Low**: Performance impact from heartbeat overhead

## Implementation Notes
- Use precise timing measurements for validation
- Mock both responsive and unresponsive client behaviors
- Monitor server-side connection state changes
- Implement comprehensive resource tracking

## Expected Outcomes
- Reliable zombie connection detection and termination
- Optimal resource utilization through connection cleanup
- Accurate heartbeat timing under various conditions
- Robust connection health monitoring system
