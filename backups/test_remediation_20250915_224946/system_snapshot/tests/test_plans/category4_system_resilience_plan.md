# Category 4: System Resilience and Fallback Mechanisms Test Plan

## Overview

**Test Category:** Category 4 - System Resilience and Fallback Mechanisms  
**Test Suite:** test_system_resilience.py  
**Business Value:** Ensures system stability and availability during infrastructure failures  
**Priority:** Critical (affects SLA compliance and revenue protection)

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)

- **Segment:** Enterprise & Platform/Internal
- **Business Goal:** Maintain service availability and SLA compliance during infrastructure failures
- **Value Impact:** Prevents revenue loss from outages, maintains customer trust
- **Strategic Impact:** 99.9% uptime vs 95% without resilience = +$50K MRR protected

## Test Objectives

1. **LLM Provider Failover** - Validate seamless switching between LLM providers
2. **Rate Limit Handling** - Ensure graceful degradation under rate limiting
3. **Database Connectivity Loss** - Test fallback mechanisms for database failures
4. **Circuit Breaker Patterns** - Verify circuit breaker activation and recovery
5. **Graceful Degradation** - Validate service continues with reduced functionality

## Architecture Components Under Test

### Core Resilience Systems
- `app/db/graceful_degradation_manager.py` - Graceful degradation management
- `app/core/unified/retry_decorator.py` - Unified retry and circuit breaker logic
- `app/db/intelligent_retry_system.py` - Database retry mechanisms
- `app/websocket/connection_reliability.py` - WebSocket resilience
- `app/core/error_handlers/error_recovery.py` - Error recovery patterns

### Key Patterns
- Circuit breaker implementation with open/half-open/closed states
- Exponential backoff with jitter for retry mechanisms
- Fallback data serving from cache during outages
- Service level degradation (full → degraded → limited → cache-only)
- Error classification and routing

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Test 1: LLM Provider Failover Resilience
**File:** `test_1_llm_provider_failover.py`
**Scenario:** Primary LLM provider becomes unavailable, system fails over to secondary
**Components:** LLM routing, provider health monitoring, request redirection
**Success Criteria:**
- Failover completes within 5 seconds
- No request loss during failover
- System automatically recovers when primary returns
- Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures

### Test 2: Rate Limit Recovery and Backoff
**File:** `test_2_rate_limit_handling.py`  
**Scenario:** LLM provider returns rate limit errors, system implements backoff
**Components:** Rate limit detection, exponential backoff, queue management
**Success Criteria:**
- Rate limits trigger appropriate delays
- Exponential backoff prevents thundering herd
- System resumes normal operation after limits reset
- Users receive informative error messages

### Test 3: Database Connection Pool Resilience
**File:** `test_3_database_connectivity_loss.py`
**Scenario:** Database connections fail, system uses cached data and graceful degradation
**Components:** Connection pooling, cache fallback, service level management
**Success Criteria:**
- Cache serves data during database outage
- Service level degrades gracefully (full → degraded → cache-only)
- System recovers when database returns
- No data corruption or inconsistency

### Test 4: Circuit Breaker Pattern Validation
**File:** `test_4_circuit_breaker_patterns.py`
**Scenario:** Service fails repeatedly, circuit breaker opens, then recovers
**Components:** Circuit breaker states, failure threshold monitoring, recovery testing
**Success Criteria:**
- Circuit opens after failure threshold reached
- Half-open state allows limited testing
- Circuit closes after successful recovery
- Proper logging and monitoring throughout

### Test 5: Multi-Service Graceful Degradation
**File:** `test_5_graceful_degradation.py`
**Scenario:** Multiple services fail simultaneously, system maintains core functionality
**Components:** Cross-service dependency management, priority operations, user notifications
**Success Criteria:**
- Core functionality remains available
- Users are informed of service limitations
- System prioritizes critical operations
- Recovery is automatic and transparent

## Test Data and Scenarios

### Failure Simulation Patterns
```python
# Network connectivity simulation
@contextmanager
async def simulate_network_failure():
    # Block network calls to specific endpoints
    
# Database failure simulation  
@contextmanager
async def simulate_database_outage():
    # Disconnect database pools temporarily
    
# Rate limit simulation
@contextmanager  
async def simulate_rate_limiting():
    # Return 429 responses from LLM providers
```

### Test Data Sets
- **User Contexts:** 10 authenticated users with different permission levels
- **Request Patterns:** High-volume, bursty, and steady-state traffic
- **Failure Scenarios:** Network timeouts, connection drops, service degradation
- **Recovery Patterns:** Immediate, gradual, and partial service restoration

## Validation Criteria

### Performance Requirements
- **Failover Time:** < 5 seconds for LLM provider switching
- **Recovery Time:** < 30 seconds after service restoration
- **Cache Hit Rate:** > 80% during database outages
- **Error Rate:** < 1% during normal operation with resilience enabled

### Functional Requirements
- All circuit breakers must implement open/half-open/closed states
- Retry mechanisms must use exponential backoff with jitter
- Cache must serve stale data during outages
- User notifications must clearly explain service limitations

### Business Requirements
- No data loss during any failure scenario
- Revenue-generating operations must be prioritized
- SLA metrics must be maintained during degraded operation
- Customer support must be automatically notified of outages

## Implementation Requirements

### Error Handling Standards
- All failures must be logged with full context
- Errors must be classified by severity (transient, degraded, persistent, fatal)
- Circuit breakers must be monitored and alertable
- Recovery must be automatic without manual intervention

### Monitoring and Observability
- Circuit breaker state changes must be logged
- Retry attempt metrics must be collected
- Service degradation levels must be tracked
- Recovery time metrics must be measured

### Integration Points
- WebSocket connections must handle reconnection gracefully
- Database operations must use connection pooling with health checks
- LLM requests must include provider selection logic
- Cache operations must have appropriate TTL and invalidation

## Test Execution Environment

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Multiple LLM provider endpoints (primary/secondary)
- Redis cache for fallback data storage
- PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- ClickHouse for analytics (optional degradation)
- WebSocket connection management

### Monitoring Setup
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
- Alert manager for failure notifications
- Log aggregation for detailed analysis

## Success Metrics

### Resilience KPIs
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):** < 30 seconds
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):** > 24 hours
- **Service Availability:** > 99.9% including degraded operation
- **Cache Effectiveness:** > 80% hit rate during outages

### Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% of critical paths tested with failure injection
- 95% of error handlers validated with real failures
- 90% of circuit breaker state transitions covered
- 100% of graceful degradation levels verified

## Risk Mitigation

### Test Isolation
- All tests run in isolated environments
- Production data is never used for failure testing
- Real services are mocked to prevent actual outages
- Test cleanup ensures no persistent state changes

### Rollback Procedures
- Each test includes proper cleanup in finally blocks
- Circuit breakers are reset after testing
- Cache is cleared between test runs
- Database connections are restored to normal state
