Issue #835 - Missing UnifiedExecutionEngineFactory Implementation Detection Tests

These tests are DESIGNED TO FAIL to systematically expose the missing
UnifiedExecutionEngineFactory implementation that was removed as over-engineering.

Test Strategy:
- Test 1-4: Core missing implementation detection (100% failure expected)
- Test 5-14: Extended missing functionality detection (100% failure expected)
- Test 15-20: Critical integration failure detection (100% failure expected)

Expected Results: 20 FAILURES demonstrating missing UnifiedExecutionEngineFactory
Failure Rate Target: 100% of this test suite (contributes to overall 80% target)

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: Test Infrastructure
- Business Goal: Detect systematic missing implementations
- Value Impact: Improve test infrastructure reliability
- Strategic Impact: Prevent future production issues through comprehensive testing
