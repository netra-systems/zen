Issue #835 - Additional Failure Detection Tests

These tests are DESIGNED TO FAIL to reach the target 80% failure rate
by systematically testing additional missing functionality from the
removed UnifiedExecutionEngineFactory.

Test Strategy:
- Test 1-6: Additional missing functionality detection (100% failure expected)
- These tests focus on edge cases and additional methods that may be missing

Expected Results: 6 FAILURES contributing to overall 80% failure rate target

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: Test Infrastructure
- Business Goal: Comprehensive detection of missing implementation gaps
- Value Impact: Prevent future production issues through exhaustive testing
- Strategic Impact: Ensure test coverage identifies all missing functionality
