# Failing Test Gardener Worklog - Critical Tests
## Execution Date: 2025-09-14
## Test Focus: CRITICAL
## Status: ACTIVE

---

## Executive Summary

Failing Test Gardener executed critical mission critical test suites to discover issues not yet documented in GitHub. Found **3 critical WebSocket event structure failures** affecting $500K+ ARR chat functionality.

### Critical Findings
- ✅ **WebSocket Connection**: Staging WebSocket connections working (wss://netra-backend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app/api/v1/websocket)  
- ❌ **Event Structure**: 3 out of 5 critical WebSocket events failing validation
- ❌ **Business Impact**: Core chat functionality events not properly structured

---

## Issue Discovery Report

### Issue #1: Agent Started Event Structure Validation Failure
**Test File**: `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`  
**Test Method**: `TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_agent_started_event_structure`  
**Status**: FAILED  
**Severity**: P1 - HIGH  
**Category**: failing-test-regression-p1-agent-started-event-validation

**Error Details**:
```
AssertionError: agent_started event structure validation failed
assert False
where False = validate_event_content_structure({'correlation_id': None, 'data': {'connection_id': 'main_fbf3b91a', ...}, 'server_id': None, 'timestamp': 1757819829.3174012, ...}, 'agent_started')
```

**Business Impact**: 
- Critical WebSocket event for chat functionality not validating properly
- Part of $500K+ ARR Golden Path user flow
- Users may not receive proper agent start notifications

**Additional Context**:
- WebSocket connection to staging successful
- Event is being received but structure validation fails
- Related to mission critical WebSocket agent events suite

### Issue #2: Tool Executing Event Missing tool_name Field
**Test File**: `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`  
**Test Method**: `TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_tool_executing_event_structure`  
**Status**: FAILED  
**Severity**: P1 - HIGH  
**Category**: failing-test-regression-p1-tool-executing-missing-field

**Error Details**:
```
AssertionError: tool_executing missing tool_name
assert 'tool_name' in {'correlation_id': None, 'data': {'connection_id': 'main_8c043223', ...}, 'server_id': None, 'timestamp': 1757819834.9593194, ...}
```

**Business Impact**:
- Tool execution transparency broken for users
- Users cannot see what tools agents are executing
- Critical for user trust and debugging agent behavior

**Additional Context**:
- Event payload is received but missing required `tool_name` field
- This is one of the 5 critical WebSocket events required for Golden Path

---

### Issue #3: Tool Completed Event Missing results Field
**Test File**: `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`  
**Test Method**: `TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_tool_completed_event_structure`  
**Status**: FAILED  
**Severity**: P1 - HIGH  
**Category**: failing-test-regression-p1-tool-completed-missing-results

**Error Details**:
```
AssertionError: tool_completed missing results
assert 'results' in {'correlation_id': None, 'data': {'connection_id': 'main_ba84fc34', ...}, 'server_id': None, 'timestamp': 1757819836.5507991, ...}
```

**Business Impact**:
- Tool completion results not being sent to users
- Users cannot see tool execution outcomes
- Breaks transparency and user experience expectations

**Additional Context**:
- Event is received but missing `results` field
- Part of critical 5-event sequence for Golden Path functionality

---

### Issue #4: SSOT Violations Test - No Output/Uncollectable
**Test File**: `tests/mission_critical/test_no_ssot_violations.py`  
**Test Method**: All methods in file  
**Status**: UNCOLLECTABLE/UNKNOWN  
**Severity**: P2 - MEDIUM  
**Category**: uncollectable-test-new-p2-ssot-violations-silent

**Error Details**:
```
Test ran without output or errors - no visible results
```

**Business Impact**:
- SSOT compliance validation status unknown
- Could be hiding architectural violations
- Impacts code quality and maintainability

**Additional Context**:
- Test executed with python3 but produced no output
- Could be passing silently or failing to run properly
- Requires investigation to determine actual status

---

## Test Execution Environment
- **Platform**: Darwin (macOS)
- **Python Version**: 3.13.7
- **WebSocket URL**: wss://netra-backend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app/api/v1/websocket
- **Connection Status**: ✅ SUCCESSFUL  
- **Docker Strategy**: Strategic resolution - using staging services directly (Issue #420)
- **Memory Usage**: Peak 229.1 MB

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (SNST Required)
1. **Search existing GitHub issues** for similar WebSocket event structure problems
2. **Create GitHub issues** for each discovered failure with proper priority tags  
3. **Link related issues** and documentation
4. **Investigation required** for SSOT violations test silent behavior

### Process Status
- [x] Critical tests executed
- [x] Issues discovered and documented
- [ ] GitHub issues created/updated (pending SNST)
- [ ] Related issues linked (pending SNST)
- [ ] Worklog committed to repository (pending)

## Repository Safety Assessment
✅ **SAFE TO PROCEED** - All test executions were read-only operations, no system modifications made.
