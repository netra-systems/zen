Unit Tests for Issue #379: WebSocket Event Confirmation Gap - Timeout Inadequacy

These tests demonstrate the fundamental timeout inadequacy issues identified in Issue #379:

CRITICAL GAPS DEMONSTRATED:
1. 2-second timeout insufficient for complex agent operations
2. No acknowledgment that client received and displayed events
3. No confirmation that events provided business value to user
4. Race conditions in event delivery timing

These tests are designed to FAIL and demonstrate the gaps that need fixing.

Business Impact: $500K+ ARR at risk from incomplete event confirmation system
Priority: CRITICAL - End-to-end user experience validation missing

Test Pattern: SSOT Base Test Case with IsolatedEnvironment
