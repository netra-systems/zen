Test ExecutionState Enum Consistency - SSOT Validation
=====================================================

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform Infrastructure - Critical for all tiers
- Business Goal: System Stability - Prevent execution state fragmentation
- Value Impact: Ensures consistent execution state tracking across all modules
- Strategic Impact: $500K+ ARR depends on reliable agent execution state management

This test validates that all ExecutionState enums across the codebase are consistent
and follow SSOT principles. ExecutionState fragmentation leads to:
1. Silent agent failures when states don't match
2. WebSocket event delivery failures
3. Execution tracking inconsistencies
4. User experience degradation (no AI responses)

CRITICAL: This test will FAIL before SSOT remediation and PASS after consolidation.
