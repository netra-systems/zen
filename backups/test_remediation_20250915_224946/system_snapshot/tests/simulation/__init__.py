Simulation Tests Package

This package contains simulation tests that reproduce infrastructure failure
patterns without requiring actual infrastructure to be in a failed state.

These tests are particularly useful for:
- Validating application behavior under stress conditions
- Reproducing reported issues in controlled environments
- Testing resilience and error handling logic
- Validating fixes before deploying to infrastructure

Test Categories:
- VPC Connector Capacity Simulation
- DNS Resolution Failure Simulation
- Database Timeout Simulation
- Load Balancer Impact Simulation
