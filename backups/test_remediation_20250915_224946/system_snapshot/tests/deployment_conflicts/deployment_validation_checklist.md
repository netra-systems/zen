# DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT CONFLICTS VALIDATION CHECKLIST
**GitHub Issue #245 - Comprehensive Test Strategy**

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This checklist provides a systematic approach to identify deployment script conflicts and validate SSOT consolidation for the Netra Apex platform. The validation covers 7+ conflicting deployment entry points, UnifiedTestRunner false claims, configuration drift risks, and terraform integration issues.

**BUSINESS IMPACT:** $500K+ ARR at risk from deployment reliability issues.

## VALIDATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Automated Conflict Detection Tests ‚ö°

**Objective:** Systematically identify all deployment conflicts using automated test suites.

#### 1.1. Deployment Script Conflicts Detection
```bash
# Execute comprehensive conflict detection
python tests/deployment_conflicts/test_deployment_script_conflicts.py conflicts

# Expected outputs:
# - Map of all 7+ deployment entry points
# - Analysis of UnifiedTestRunner false deployment mode claims  
# - Configuration consistency analysis across deployment methods

```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All deployment entry points identified and categorized
- [ ] UnifiedTestRunner deployment mode claims validated
- [ ] Configuration drift quantified (<30% acceptable)

```bash
# Test terraform to deployment script integration
python tests/deployment_conflicts/test_deployment_integration_validation.py::TestDeploymentPipelineIntegration::test_terraform_to_script_integration_chain

```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Development, staging, production configs properly isolated
- [ ] No configuration sharing between environments
- [ ] All environments have valid configurations

### Phase 3: Functional Deployment Testing üöÄ

**Objective:** Safely test actual deployment functionality with staging environment.

#### 3.1. Pre-Deployment Environment Checks
```bash
# Verify Docker daemon status (critical dependency)
docker info
docker ps

# Check staging environment connectivity
python scripts/deploy_to_gcp_actual.py --project netra-staging --check-apis --dry-run

# Validate terraform state
cd terraform-gcp-staging
terraform plan -var="project_id=netra-staging"
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Docker daemon running and accessible
- [ ] GCP staging project accessible
- [ ] Terraform state consistent
- [ ] All required APIs enabled

#### 3.2. Deployment Script Functionality Testing
```bash
# Test each deployment script's functionality (dry-run mode)
python tests/deployment_conflicts/test_deployment_integration_validation.py::TestDeploymentPipelineIntegration::test_deployment_performance_impact_analysis

# Manual functionality tests:
python scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py --help
python scripts/deploy_to_gcp_actual.py --help
python scripts/deploy_staging_with_validation.py --help
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Exactly 1 deployment script fully functional
- [ ] Deprecated scripts properly redirect or fail gracefully
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable ranges

#### 3.3. Rollback Capability Validation
```bash
# Test rollback mechanisms
python tests/deployment_conflicts/test_deployment_integration_validation.py::TestDeploymentPipelineIntegration::test_deployment_rollback_capability_validation

# Manual rollback test (staging only):
# python scripts/deploy_to_gcp_actual.py --project netra-staging --rollback
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] At least one deployment method supports rollback
- [ ] Rollback mechanisms properly documented
- [ ] Emergency rollback procedures validated

### Phase 4: Staging Environment Validation üß™

**‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION:** Only perform staging deployment if all previous phases pass.

#### 4.1. Staging Deployment Health Check
```bash
# Full staging deployment validation (if safe)
# ONLY run if Docker daemon issues resolved and all tests pass

python scripts/deploy_to_gcp_actual.py --project netra-staging --build-local --run-checks

# Post-deployment validation:
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py
curl https://staging-backend-url/health
curl https://staging-auth-url/health
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Staging deployment completes successfully
- [ ] All health endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] WebSocket events validated in staging
- [ ] User login ‚Üí AI response flow works end-to-end

#### 4.2. Performance Impact Measurement
```bash
# Measure deployment performance impact
python tests/deployment_conflicts/test_deployment_integration_validation.py::TestDeploymentPipelineIntegration::test_deployment_performance_impact_analysis

# Resource usage monitoring:
# Monitor CPU, memory, and network during deployment
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Deployment completes within acceptable time (<15 minutes)
- [ ] Resource usage within normal limits
- [ ] No performance degradation in staging services

## MANUAL VALIDATION STEPS

### Configuration Consistency Verification

#### Docker vs GCP Configuration Comparison
```bash
# Compare Docker and GCP service configurations
diff <(yq .services docker-compose.yml | sort) <(grep -o '".*"' scripts/deploy_to_gcp_actual.py | sort)

# Validate environment variable consistency
grep -r "ENVIRONMENT\|ENV" docker-compose*.yml
grep -r "ENVIRONMENT\|ENV" scripts/deploy*.py
```

#### Terraform Integration Verification  
```bash
# Check terraform calls to deployment scripts
cd terraform-gcp-staging
grep -n "deploy" *.sh *.ps1 *.py 2>/dev/null || echo "No deployment script calls found"

# Validate terraform variable consistency
terraform plan -var-file=staging.tfvars
```

### UnifiedTestRunner Deployment Mode Investigation

#### False Claims Verification
```bash
# Check if unified test runner actually supports deployment mode
grep -n "execution-mode.*deploy\|deploy.*execution-mode" tests/unified_test_runner.py

# Test deployment mode claim
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --execution-mode deploy --help 2>&1 | grep -i "invalid\|error\|unknown"
```

#### Alternative Deployment Path Analysis
```bash
# Find actual deployment implementation in test runner
grep -A 10 -B 5 "deploy\|deployment" tests/unified_test_runner.py | head -50

# Check test categories for deployment-related tests
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --list-categories | grep -i deploy
```

## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Docker Daemon Dependency Management
- **Issue:** Docker daemon connectivity preventing real service testing
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Use docker-compose down/up cycle before testing
  - Implement fallback to docker-desktop or podman
  - Create Docker-free deployment path for CI/CD

### Configuration Drift Prevention
- **Issue:** Different deployment methods using inconsistent configurations
- **Mitigation:**
  - Consolidate all configurations to single source (SSOT)
  - Implement configuration validation tests
  - Add pre-deployment configuration checks

### Staging Environment Protection
- **Issue:** Risk of breaking staging during validation
- **Mitigation:**
  - Always use --dry-run flag first
  - Implement rollback testing before deployment testing
  - Create temporary staging environment for testing
