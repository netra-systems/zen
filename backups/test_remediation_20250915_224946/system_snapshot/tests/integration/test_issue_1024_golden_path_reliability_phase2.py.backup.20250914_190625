Phase 2: Integration Tests for Issue #1024 - Golden Path Reliability Testing

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform (All segments depend on Golden Path reliability)
- Business Goal: Stability - Validate end-to-end Golden Path reliability
- Value Impact: Ensures $500K+ ARR chat functionality works consistently
- Revenue Impact: Prevents customer churn from unreliable AI responses

CRITICAL PURPOSE: Validate SSOT test runner functionality and measure
Golden Path reliability baseline vs target performance.

Test Strategy:
1. Validate unified test runner SSOT functionality
2. Measure Golden Path test execution reliability
3. Test cross-service integration reliability
4. Validate business-critical test scenarios
