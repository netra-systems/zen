Integration tests for Issue #1270: Test runner pattern filtering causes real-world failures

These tests SHOULD FAIL to demonstrate the real-world impact of the pattern filtering bug
in unified_test_runner.py. The bug causes incorrect test selection and false-positive results.

Business Impact: Platform/Internal - Test Infrastructure Reliability
- Pattern filtering incorrectly applied to database category causes deselected tests
- Fast-fail behavior triggered by deselected tests instead of actual failures
- False confidence in test results due to incorrect filtering

Expected Behavior:
- Database category runs all specified test files
- Pattern filtering only applies to categories designed for it
- Test deselection only happens when tests are truly irrelevant

Actual Behavior (BUG):
- Database category gets pattern filtering when it shouldn't
- Tests get deselected when they should run
- Fast-fail triggered by deselected tests, masking real issues
