"""
Integration tests for E2E harness workflow - Issue #732 Phase 2

These tests validate the complete workflow and integration behavior of the missing
E2E harness components. Tests use real HTTP connections to ports 8001/8000 and
demonstrate the expected workflow once components are implemented.

Business Value: Platform/Internal - E2E Test Infrastructure Reliability
Ensures E2E harness provides complete integration capabilities for testing.

Test Strategy:
- Test actual HTTP communication capabilities with auth/backend services
- Validate complete harness workflow from creation to cleanup
- Test concurrent usage patterns and resource management
- Use real HTTP connections (no Docker required - ports 8001/8000)
- Follow SSOT patterns and CLAUDE.md standards

EXPECTED RESULT: All tests FAIL with ImportError, proving missing implementations
