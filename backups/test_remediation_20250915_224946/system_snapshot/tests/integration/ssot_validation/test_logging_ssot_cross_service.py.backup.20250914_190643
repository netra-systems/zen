Integration Test: Cross-Service Logging SSOT Enforcement

PURPOSE: This test is DESIGNED TO FAIL with current cross-service logging violations.
It validates that all services use shared.logging.unified_logger_factory consistently.

CRITICAL: This test proves cross-service SSOT enforcement works by failing
with current violations across netra_backend, auth_service, and other services.

Business Value: Platform/Internal - System Stability & Development Velocity
Ensures consistent logging infrastructure across all microservices for operational visibility.

TEST DESIGN:
- Inherits from SSotBaseTestCase for consistent test infrastructure
- Scans multiple services for logging SSOT compliance
- MUST FAIL initially to prove cross-service detection works
- Validates unified logging factory usage across service boundaries
- Detects services bypassing SSOT logging infrastructure

REQUIREMENTS per CLAUDE.md:
- Must inherit from SSotBaseTestCase 
- Must validate all services use shared.logging.unified_logger_factory
- Must be atomic and complete within 2 minutes (integration test)
- Must provide detailed cross-service violation reports
- NO Docker dependencies (integration test without docker orchestration)

SERVICES TESTED:
- netra_backend: Main backend service
- auth_service: Authentication service
- analytics_service: Analytics service (if exists)
- Cross-service shared modules

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Test MUST fail initially (proves cross-service detection works)
- Clear violation report across all services
- Service-by-service breakdown of violations
- Remediation guidance for each service
- Enable test-driven cross-service SSOT compliance
