# Golden Path Phase 2 Regression Prevention Test Documentation

## Executive Summary

**File**: `test_golden_path_phase2_regression_prevention.py`  
**Purpose**: Protect $500K+ ARR during MessageRouter proxy removal (SSOT Phase 2)  
**Type**: Mission-critical E2E test using staging environment  
**Business Impact**: Prevents Golden Path regression during infrastructure migration  

## Critical Mission

This test serves as the **primary safeguard** for the Golden Path user flow during the SSOT MessageRouter Phase 2 migration. The Golden Path represents 90% of platform business value - users login, send messages, and receive AI responses.

### Business Risk

Without this test protection:
- Proxy removal could break message routing without detection
- Users would lose access to core chat functionality  
- $500K+ ARR at immediate risk from broken user experience
- Customer churn from non-functional AI interactions

## Test Architecture

### Core Validation Scenarios

#### 1. Complete User Flow Test (`test_complete_golden_path_user_flow`)
**Purpose**: End-to-end validation of login → message → AI response flow  
**Critical Validations**:
- WebSocket authentication to staging environment
- Message routing through current proxy pattern
- All 5 critical WebSocket events delivered:
  - `agent_started` - User sees AI began work
  - `agent_thinking` - Real-time reasoning updates  
  - `tool_executing` - Tool usage transparency
  - `tool_completed` - Tool results display
  - `agent_completed` - Final results ready
- Agent response quality assessment (≥60/100 score)
- Business value indicators in responses
- Performance within acceptable thresholds

#### 2. WebSocket Event Sequence Test (`test_websocket_event_sequence_validation`)
**Purpose**: Validate event ordering remains consistent after proxy removal  
**Critical Validations**:
- `agent_started` precedes `agent_thinking`
- `tool_executing` precedes corresponding `tool_completed`
- `agent_completed` as final event in sequence
- No missing or out-of-order events

#### 3. Concurrent User Isolation Test (`test_concurrent_user_isolation`)
**Purpose**: Ensure user isolation maintained during routing changes  
**Critical Validations**:
- Multiple concurrent users receive only their own events
- User context properly isolated between sessions
- Unique user markers preserved in responses
- No cross-user data contamination

#### 4. Error Handling Test (`test_error_handling_graceful_degradation`)
**Purpose**: Validate graceful degradation if routing issues occur  
**Critical Validations**:
- Malformed messages handled gracefully
- System recovers from incomplete requests
- Valid messages processed after errors
- No system crashes from routing failures

#### 5. Performance Baseline Test (`test_performance_baseline_establishment`)
**Purpose**: Establish performance baseline for comparison  
**Critical Validations**:
- Connection time ≤10 seconds
- First event time ≤20 seconds  
- Completion time ≤120 seconds
- Baseline metrics recorded for post-migration comparison

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### SSOT Compliance
- Inherits from `SSotAsyncTestCase` for unified test infrastructure
- Uses staging configuration from `tests/e2e/staging_config.py`
- Follows CLAUDE.md guidelines for real services (no mocks)
- Integrates with unified test runner

### Authentication Strategy
- Real JWT/OAuth authentication to staging environment
- Leverages `JWT_SECRET_STAGING` for token generation
- Uses production authentication patterns
- No authentication mocking or bypassing

### Staging Environment
- Tests against real deployed staging services
- Uses canonical staging URLs: `https://*.staging.netrasystems.ai`
- WebSocket connection to `wss://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/ws`
- Validates production-like behavior

### Performance Monitoring
- Comprehensive metrics collection via `GoldenPathTestMetrics`
- Business value tracking through response quality assessment
- Performance baseline establishment for comparison
- Real-time event sequence validation

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Test

```bash
# Run all Golden Path Phase 2 tests
python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_golden_path_phase2_regression_prevention.py -v

# Run specific test scenario
python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_golden_path_phase2_regression_prevention.py::TestGoldenPathPhase2RegressionPrevention::test_complete_golden_path_user_flow -v

# Run with staging environment validation
ENVIRONMENT=staging python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_golden_path_phase2_regression_prevention.py -v
```

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Staging authentication
JWT_SECRET_STAGING=<staging_jwt_secret>
E2E_OAUTH_SIMULATION_KEY=<oauth_simulation_key>

# Test configuration  
ENVIRONMENT=staging
GOLDEN_PATH_PHASE2_TEST=true
TEST_USER_ISOLATION=enabled
```

### Test Execution Phases

#### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Validation (Current State)
1. Run test suite to establish baseline
2. Verify all tests pass with proxy pattern active
3. Record performance metrics and response quality
4. Confirm WebSocket event delivery reliability

#### Phase 2: Post-Migration Validation (Target State)  
1. Run identical test suite after proxy removal
2. Compare against Phase 1 baseline metrics
3. Verify all tests continue passing
4. Validate no performance degradation
5. Confirm event delivery remains reliable
