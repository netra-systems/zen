1. **Right-size your instances**: Analyze utilization and downsize over-provisioned instances (can save 20-30%)
2. **Use Reserved Instances**: For predictable workloads, commit to 1-3 year terms for 30-60% savings  
3. **Implement Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjust capacity based on demand
4. **Use Spot Instances**: For fault-tolerant workloads, save up to 90%
5. **Set up Cost Monitoring**: CloudWatch alarms when spending exceeds thresholds

**Implementation steps:**
- Start with AWS Cost Explorer to identify highest costs
- Use AWS Trusted Advisor for right-sizing recommendations  
- Configure Auto Scaling groups for your applications

This approach typically achieves 25-35% cost reduction within 30 days."""
