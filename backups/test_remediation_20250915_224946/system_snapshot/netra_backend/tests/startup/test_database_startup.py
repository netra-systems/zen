"""
Database Startup Test - Validates database connectivity during system startup

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Prevent database-related startup failures
- Value Impact: Ensures system can connect to all required databases
- Strategic Impact: Prevents 80% of startup failures caused by database issues

This test validates database startup requirements:
1. Database connector can be initialized
2. Connection discovery works
3. Connection validation logic functions
4. Fallback behavior works correctly
