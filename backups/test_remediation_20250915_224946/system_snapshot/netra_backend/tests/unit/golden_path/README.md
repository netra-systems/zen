# Golden Path Unit Tests

This directory contains comprehensive unit tests for the **Golden Path** user flow business logic. These tests validate critical business components without requiring external services, focusing on business rules, data validation, and workflow logic.

## üéØ Business Value

The Golden Path represents our core $500K+ ARR chat functionality - the complete user journey from authentication through agent execution to final response delivery. These unit tests ensure:

- **Business Logic Validation**: Core business rules work correctly for 90% of user scenarios
- **Component Isolation**: Individual components function correctly in isolation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and proper error reporting
- **Data Integrity**: Critical data validation and transformation logic
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed business operations across services

## üß™ Test Categories

### 1. Authentication Business Logic (`test_auth_flows_business_logic.py`)

Tests core authentication business logic:

- **JWT Token Management**: Creation, validation, expiration, and security
- **User Context Creation**: Execution context for authenticated users  
- **Password Security**: Hashing, verification, and security requirements
- **User Permissions**: Role-based access control and business authorization
- **Multi-user Isolation**: Complete user session isolation
- **Authentication State**: Token caching, refresh, and lifecycle management

**Key Business Rules Tested:**
- Tokens must contain required claims for user identification
- Same password must produce different hashes (salting requirement) 
- Premium users have more permissions than economy users
- Authentication state is properly managed for efficiency
- Different users have completely isolated authentication

### 2. WebSocket Management Business Logic (`test_websocket_management_business_logic.py`)

Tests WebSocket connection management without real connections:

- **Message Creation**: Proper WebSocket message structure and formatting
- **User Isolation**: WebSocket context ensures proper user separation
- **Event Generation**: Critical business events (agent_started, agent_thinking, etc.)
- **Connection Lifecycle**: State management and resource cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Connection failures and graceful degradation
- **Notification System**: Real-time updates for user experience

**Key Business Rules Tested:**
- Messages must be JSON serializable for transmission
- Each user has isolated WebSocket context
- All 5 critical events are sent in golden path workflow
- Connection errors don't crash the notification system
- Events provide proper business context and timestamps

### 3. Agent Execution Workflow Business Logic (`test_agent_execution_workflow_business_logic.py`)

Tests agent orchestration with mocked LLM responses:

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Correct sequence (Data ‚Üí Optimization ‚Üí Reporting)
- **User Session Isolation**: Complete isolation for concurrent users
- **Mock LLM Integration**: Business logic testing without actual LLM calls
- **Result Aggregation**: Combining agent results for business value
- **Performance Tracking**: Execution time and token usage monitoring
- **Business Value Delivery**: Cost analysis, optimization, and reporting

**Key Business Rules Tested:**
- Agents execute in correct business sequence
- User sessions are completely isolated
- Agent results provide structured business data
- Workflow completes within business time requirements
- Total token usage is optimized for cost efficiency

### 4. Data Validation & Transformation Business Logic (`test_data_validation_transformation_business_logic.py`)

Tests critical data processing for business operations:

- **User Data Validation**: Email, password, and profile validation
- **Cost Calculation Validation**: Token usage and billing accuracy
- **Data Transformation**: Raw data to business-friendly formats
- **JSON Serialization**: API and storage compatibility
- **Currency Formatting**: Consistent financial data presentation
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Validation of business constraints

**Key Business Rules Tested:**
- User data meets business validation requirements
- Cost calculations handle edge cases properly
- Data transformations preserve business meaning
- Currency values are formatted consistently
- Business validation is enforced across components

### 5. Error Handling Business Logic (`test_error_handling_business_logic.py`)

Tests error handling for business continuity:

- **Business Continuity**: Service degradation doesn't break workflows
- **Error Classification**: Severity based on business impact
- **User Communication**: Technical errors converted to business-friendly messages
- **Recovery Strategies**: Different approaches based on error type
- **Monitoring Integration**: Business-relevant error tracking
- **SLA Compliance**: Error recovery maintains business commitments

**Key Business Rules Tested:**
- Authentication errors don't crash the system
- Database errors provide business-appropriate messaging
- Partial failures allow workflow continuation
- Error recovery restores SLA compliance
- Business impact is properly assessed and communicated

## üé≠ Test Patterns & Standards

### Pytest Markers

All golden path unit tests use these markers:

```python
@pytest.mark.unit
@pytest.mark.golden_path
class TestBusinessLogic:
    """Test class following golden path patterns."""
```

### Mock Usage

Tests use appropriate mocking for external dependencies:

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock, AsyncMock, patch

# Mock external services
@patch('module.external_service')
def test_business_logic_with_mocked_service(self, mock_service):
    mock_service.return_value = expected_business_result
    # Test business logic without external dependencies
```

### Business Value Documentation

Each test module documents business value:

```python
"""
Golden Path Unit Tests: Component Name

Business Value:
- Ensures X works correctly for 90% of user scenarios
- Validates Y for business requirements
- Tests Z without external dependencies
"""
```

### Test Naming Conventions

Test names indicate business purpose:

- `test_*_business_logic()`
- `test_*_business_rules()` 
- `test_*_business_requirements()`
- `test_*_business_continuity()`
- `test_*_business_value()`

## ‚úÖ Test Suite Validation

The `test_golden_path_suite.py` validates that:

1. **All Required Modules Present**: Core business logic areas are covered
2. **Proper Markers**: All tests have `@pytest.mark.golden_path` and `@pytest.mark.unit`
3. **Business Documentation**: Modules document business value in docstrings
4. **Business Logic Tests**: Test methods focus on business requirements
5. **Mock Usage**: External dependencies are properly mocked
6. **Coverage Completeness**: All critical business areas are tested

## üîÑ Integration with Main Test Suite

These unit tests integrate with the main test runner:

```bash
# Run as part of unit test category
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category unit

# Run specific golden path unit tests
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category unit -k "golden_path"

# Include in pre-commit validation
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --categories unit integration --fast-fail
```

## üìä Expected Performance

**Target Performance Metrics:**

- **Individual Test Speed**: < 100ms per test
- **Full Suite Speed**: < 30 seconds for all golden path unit tests
- **Memory Usage**: < 250MB peak memory

## üí° Key Insights

**Why Golden Path Unit Tests Matter:**

1. **Business Confidence**: Validates core revenue-generating functionality
2. **Fast Feedback**: No external dependencies = rapid test execution  
3. **Regression Prevention**: Catches business logic breaks before deployment
4. **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable business requirements
5. **Refactoring Safety**: Enables confident code improvements

**Test Philosophy:**

> These tests focus on **business logic validation** rather than technical implementation details. They answer the question: "Does this component deliver the expected business value?" rather than "Does this code work technically?"

The Golden Path Unit Tests are your first line of defense for ensuring the $500K+ ARR chat functionality works correctly for the majority of users in the majority of scenarios.

**üö® Remember**: These are **unit tests** - they test business logic in isolation. For end-to-end validation of the complete golden path with real services, see the E2E golden path tests in `/tests/e2e/golden_path/`.
