"""
Test Database Models Agent - Cycle 53
Tests the core database models used by agents.

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: Platform/Internal  
- Business Goal: Data model integrity and reliability
- Value Impact: Prevents data corruption and ensures agent state consistency
- Strategic Impact: Core data layer stability for agent operations
