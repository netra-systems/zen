Test Thread Cleanup Manager NoneType Fix - Issue #704

This test module validates the fix for Issue #704 where NoneType errors occurred
in _schedule_cleanup method when asyncio event loop or its methods became None
during cleanup operations.

Test Coverage:
1. Event loop becomes None during cleanup scheduling
2. Event loop.create_task becomes None/invalid
3. Event loop gets closed during cleanup callback execution
4. Proper fallback to thread-based cleanup when asyncio unavailable
5. Enhanced logging validation for diagnostic information
