"""
Unit Tests for ExecutionTracker Business Logic - Comprehensive Coverage

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
- Business Goal: Agent Reliability - Prevent silent agent failures from degrading user experience  
- Value Impact: Execution tracking ensures agent operations complete successfully or fail visibly
- Strategic Impact: Reliable agent execution is fundamental to platform trust and business value delivery

This test suite validates the business-critical path of execution tracking including:
- Silent agent death detection to prevent business process hangs
- Timeout enforcement to prevent resource waste and user abandonment
- Execution state monitoring for business process transparency
- Metrics collection for business performance insights
- Recovery mechanisms for business continuity
- Multi-user execution isolation for enterprise scalability

CRITICAL: These tests focus on BUSINESS LOGIC that ensures AI agents execute
reliably and provide visible failures when business processes encounter issues.
