# UnifiedLifecycleManager Test Coverage Summary

## üöÄ Overview

Created comprehensive unit tests for the `UnifiedLifecycleManager` SSOT class following CLAUDE.md requirements and TEST_CREATION_GUIDE.md specifications.

**File:** `test_unified_lifecycle_manager_real.py`
**Total Tests:** 79 test cases
**Testing Approach:** Tests REAL UnifiedLifecycleManager class with NO MOCKS

## ‚úÖ Business Value Justification (BVJ)

- **Segment:** Platform/Internal - Development Velocity, Risk Reduction
- **Business Goal:** Ensure reliable lifecycle management across all services
- **Value Impact:** Prevents service startup/shutdown issues, resource leaks, and chat interruption
- **Strategic Impact:** Validates SSOT lifecycle consolidation for zero-downtime deployments

- ‚úÖ Follows reports/testing/TEST_CREATION_GUIDE.md strictly
- ‚úÖ NO inheritance from SSotBaseTestCase (uses proper pytest fixtures)

### Mock Components for Testing:
- `MockComponent`: Simulates real services with configurable behavior
