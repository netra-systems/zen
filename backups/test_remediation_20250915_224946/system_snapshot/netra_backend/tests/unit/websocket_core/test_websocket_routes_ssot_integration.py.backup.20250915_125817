Unit Tests for WebSocket Routes SSOT Integration - Golden Path Critical

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
- Business Goal: Ensure WebSocket route consolidation maintains Golden Path
- Value Impact: Route consolidation affects $500K+ ARR WebSocket functionality
- Strategic Impact: MISSION CRITICAL - SSOT routes must preserve all Golden Path features

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the WebSocket routes SSOT integration,
focusing on the route consolidation and compatibility layers.

COVERAGE TARGET: netra_backend/app/routes/websocket.py and websocket_ssot.py
Issue: #727 - WebSocket core coverage gaps

The WebSocket routes SSOT integration is mission-critical because:
1. It consolidates 4 competing route implementations into single SSOT
2. It maintains backward compatibility during SSOT transition
3. It preserves all Golden Path functionality (login â†’ AI responses)
4. It provides mode-based routing for different WebSocket patterns

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- All Golden Path WebSocket events must work correctly
- Backward compatibility must be maintained for existing imports
- Route consolidation must not break any functionality
- Performance must not degrade during SSOT transition
- All modes (unified, factory, isolated) must be supported

Test Strategy:
- Import compatibility testing for route redirection
- Functional testing of SSOT route capabilities
- Golden Path event validation through routes
- Performance testing of consolidated routes
- Error handling and fallback behavior
