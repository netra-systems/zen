# RED TEAM TESTS - TIER 2: MAJOR FUNCTIONALITY FAILURES

## Overview

This directory contains RED TEAM integration tests for Tier 2 of the comprehensive test plan. These tests focus on **MAJOR FUNCTIONALITY FAILURES** that would severely impact user experience and business operations.

## Test Categories (Tests 16-25)

### Core Infrastructure Failures
- **Test 16**: Redis Session Store Consistency
- **Test 17**: ClickHouse Data Ingestion Pipeline  
- **Test 18**: File Upload and Storage
- **Test 19**: Background Job Processing

### Service Coordination Failures
- **Test 20**: Circuit Breaker State Management
- **Test 21**: Transaction Rollback Coordination
- **Test 22**: Error Response Consistency
- **Test 23**: Retry Logic Coordination

### System Resilience Failures
- **Test 24**: Graceful Degradation
- **Test 25**: Memory and Resource Leak Detection

## Testing Philosophy

### Real Services Only
- **NO MOCKS**: All tests use real services, databases, and external dependencies
- **REAL FAILURES**: Tests are designed to fail initially to expose actual integration gaps
- **BUSINESS IMPACT**: Each test maps to specific business value and user impact

### Expected Initial Results
These tests are **DESIGNED TO FAIL** initially. Each failure exposes real integration issues that need to be addressed for production readiness.

### Success Criteria
Tests pass when:
1. Core functionality works under stress
2. Error handling is comprehensive
3. Recovery mechanisms function properly
4. Resource management is effective
5. Cross-service coordination is reliable

## Business Value Justification

### Revenue Impact
- **Free Tier**: Core functionality failures prevent conversion to paid tiers
- **Early/Mid Tier**: Service unreliability causes churn and negative reviews
- **Enterprise**: Major failures break SLAs and damage partnerships

### Platform Stability
- **Resource Leaks**: Cause platform instability and increased infrastructure costs
- **Failed Transactions**: Lead to data inconsistency and user frustration
- **Poor Error Handling**: Results in poor user experience and support burden

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites
- Real PostgreSQL database running
- Real Redis instance available
- Real ClickHouse instance (if enabled)
- File system access for uploads
- Network connectivity for external services

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all Tier 2 tests
pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/tier2_major_failures/ -v

# Run specific test category
pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/tier2_major_failures/test_redis_session_consistency.py -v

# Run with real LLM (when applicable)
pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/tier2_major_failures/ --real-llm -v
```

### Test Configuration
- Uses real service configurations
- Connects to actual databases
- Performs real file operations
- Tests actual resource usage

## Expected Failure Patterns

### Common Initial Failures
1. **Missing Implementation**: Core functionality not implemented
2. **Poor Error Handling**: Exceptions not caught or handled properly
3. **Resource Leaks**: Memory, file handles, or database connections not cleaned up
4. **Race Conditions**: Concurrent operations interfering with each other
5. **Configuration Issues**: Services not properly configured for edge cases

### Recovery Strategies
Each test includes:
- Clear failure documentation
- Suggested fix approaches
- Business impact assessment
- Recovery verification steps

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Success Metrics
- Test pass rate > 90%
- Resource usage within bounds
- Error recovery time < 30 seconds
- Cross-service coordination success rate > 95%

### Critical Alerts
- Any test failure should trigger investigation
- Resource leak detection should trigger immediate cleanup
- Cross-service failures should trigger service health checks

## Contributing

### Adding New Tests
1. Focus on major functionality that impacts users
2. Use real services (no mocks)
3. Include comprehensive business value justification
4. Design for initial failure to expose real issues

### Test Structure
```python
class TestMajorFunctionality:
    """Test major functionality - DESIGNED TO FAIL initially."""
    
    async def test_functionality_fails(self):
        """Test [functionality] (EXPECTED TO FAIL)
        
        Business Value: [explain user/business impact]
        Will likely FAIL because: [list expected issues]
        """
        # Real service usage only
        # Comprehensive failure scenarios
        # Clear success criteria
```
