# RED TEAM Integration Tests

## Overview

This directory contains **RED TEAM** integration tests that are **DESIGNED TO FAIL** initially. These tests expose real vulnerabilities and integration issues in the Netra Apex platform by testing against actual services and databases.

## Design Philosophy

**CRITICAL**: These tests are intentionally designed to fail on first run to prove they are testing real issues, not just passing due to inadequate test coverage.

### Why Tests Are Designed to Fail

1. **Proves Test Validity**: A test that passes immediately might not be testing the right thing
2. **Exposes Real Issues**: Uses real services to uncover actual production vulnerabilities  
3. **No False Confidence**: Prevents the illusion of security through passing but ineffective tests
4. **Forces Implementation**: Failing tests drive the implementation of proper safety measures

## Test Categories

### Tier 1 Catastrophic Tests (Tests 6-10)

#### Test 6: Database Migration Failure Recovery
**File**: `tier1_catastrophic/test_database_migration_failure_recovery.py`

**Designed to Fail Because**:
- Alembic migrations with active connections will block/timeout
- Rollback scenarios often leave partial schema changes
- Schema consistency checks reveal corruption after failed migrations
- Concurrent migrations cause race conditions and version conflicts

**What It Exposes**:
- Migration system lacks proper connection management
- No proper rollback mechanisms for partial failures
- Schema validation gaps after migration failures
- Race condition vulnerabilities in migration processes

#### Test 7: WebSocket Authentication Integration
**File**: `tier1_catastrophic/test_websocket_authentication_integration.py`

**Designed to Fail Because**:
- JWT secret mismatch between auth service and WebSocket handler
- No token expiration checking during active connections
- Invalid tokens may be accepted due to weak validation
- Memory leaks from failed auth attempts

**What It Exposes**:
- WebSocket auth not properly integrated with auth service
- Missing token lifecycle management
- Authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- Resource leaks during auth failures

#### Test 8: Service Discovery Failure Cascades  
**File**: `tier1_catastrophic/test_service_discovery_failure_cascades.py`

**Designed to Fail Because**:
- Services don't handle auth service downtime gracefully
- No circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures
- Health checks don't properly aggregate service states
- Service registry doesn't detect stale services

**What It Exposes**:
- Lack of graceful degradation patterns
- Missing circuit breaker implementations
- Inadequate health check propagation
- Service discovery resilience gaps

#### Test 9: API Gateway Rate Limiting Accuracy
**File**: `tier1_catastrophic/test_api_gateway_rate_limiting_accuracy.py`

**Designed to Fail Because**:
- Rate limit counters have race conditions under concurrent load
- Cross-service rate coordination is missing or broken
- Time windows don't reset properly
- Rate limiting can be bypassed with key variations

**What It Exposes**:
- Non-atomic rate limiting operations
- Missing cross-service rate coordination
- TTL and time window management issues
- Rate limiting bypass vulnerabilities

#### Test 10: Thread CRUD Operations Data Consistency
**File**: `tier1_catastrophic/test_thread_crud_operations_data_consistency.py`

**Designed to Fail Because**:
- Read-after-write consistency issues
- Lost updates during concurrent operations
- API responses don't match database state
- Cascade deletes don't work properly

**What It Exposes**:
- Database transaction isolation problems
- Missing optimistic locking for concurrent updates
- API/database consistency gaps
- Incomplete cascade delete implementations

## Running RED TEAM Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Real Services Required**: These tests require actual running services:
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Redis instance
   - Auth service
   - Backend service

2. **No Mocking**: Tests intentionally use real services to expose actual issues

### Execution

```bash
# Run all RED TEAM tests (expect failures initially)
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/ -v

# Run specific tier
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/tier1_catastrophic/ -v

# Run individual test  
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/tier1_catastrophic/test_database_migration_failure_recovery.py -v

# Run with detailed failure output
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/ -v -s --tb=long
```

### Expected Behavior

**On First Run**: Tests should FAIL, exposing real issues
**After Fixes**: Tests should PASS, confirming vulnerabilities are resolved

## Test Structure

Each test file follows this pattern:

```python
"""
RED TEAM TEST X: [Test Name]

DESIGN TO FAIL: This test is DESIGNED to FAIL initially to validate:
1. [Specific vulnerability 1]
2. [Specific vulnerability 2] 
3. [Specific vulnerability 3]

These tests use real [services/databases] and will expose actual issues.
"""

class TestClassName:
    """
    RED TEAM Test Suite: [Test Name]
    
    DESIGNED TO FAIL: These tests expose real [vulnerability type]
    """
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_specific_failure_scenario(self):
        """
        DESIGNED TO FAIL: [Specific test description]
        
        This test WILL FAIL because:
        1. [Reason 1]
        2. [Reason 2]
        3. [Reason 3]
        """
        # Test implementation that exposes real issues
        
        # THIS WILL FAIL: [Explanation of expected failure]
        assert condition, "Expected failure message explaining the issue"
```

## Integration with CI/CD

### Development Workflow

1. **Run RED TEAM Tests**: Execute tests expecting failures
2. **Analyze Failures**: Each failure reveals a real vulnerability
3. **Implement Fixes**: Address the underlying issues
4. **Verify Fixes**: Tests should pass after proper implementation
5. **Regression Prevention**: Keep tests in suite to prevent regressions

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# Example CI configuration
- name: "RED TEAM Tests (Expect Initial Failures)"
  run: |
    python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/red_team/ \
      --tb=short --continue-on-collection-errors
  continue-on-error: true  # Allow failures initially
```

## Security and Safety

### Production Safety

- Tests are designed for development/staging environments
- Use test databases and services, never production
- Include cleanup mechanisms to prevent data pollution

### Test Isolation

- Each test includes proper setup/teardown
- Tests don't interfere with each other
- Real services are reset between test runs

## Contributing

### Adding New RED TEAM Tests

1. **Identify Real Vulnerability**: Focus on actual production risks
2. **Design to Fail**: Ensure test will fail initially
3. **Use Real Services**: No mocking, test actual integration points
4. **Document Failure Reasons**: Clearly explain why test should fail
5. **Include Fix Validation**: Test should pass after proper implementation

### Test Review Criteria

- [ ] Test uses real services/databases
- [ ] Test is designed to fail initially  
- [ ] Failure reasons are clearly documented
- [ ] Test exposes actual vulnerability
- [ ] Proper cleanup/teardown included
- [ ] Clear documentation of what fix should achieve

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Test Environment Setup**:
- Ensure all required services are running
- Verify database connections and Redis connectivity
- Check service authentication and networking

**Test Execution**:
- Tests should fail initially - this is expected
- Analyze failure messages for vulnerability details
- Implement fixes based on exposed issues

**Service Dependencies**:
- Auth service must be accessible
- Database migrations must be possible
- Redis must support rate limiting operations

**Remember**: These tests are DESIGNED TO FAIL initially. Each failure reveals a real vulnerability that must be addressed to improve system security and reliability.
