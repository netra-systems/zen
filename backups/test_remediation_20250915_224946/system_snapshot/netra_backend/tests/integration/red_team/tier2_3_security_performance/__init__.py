RED TEAM TESTING - Tier 2/3: Security, Performance, and Service Degradation

This tier contains RED TEAM tests that are designed to FAIL initially to expose
real security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and service degradation issues.

Tests 26-40: Security, Performance, and Service Degradation Coverage:
- Input Validation Across Service Boundaries
- Permission Enforcement Consistency  
- SQL Injection Prevention
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
- Content Security Policy Enforcement
- Database Query Performance Under Load
- Connection Pool Scaling
- Memory Usage in Agent Processing
- WebSocket Connection Limits
- Cache Invalidation Timing
- Health Check Endpoint Accuracy
- Metrics Collection Pipeline
- Log Aggregation Consistency
- Environment Variable Propagation
- Secret Management Integration

These tests use REAL services with minimal mocking to expose actual integration issues.
Expected initial result: FAILURE (this exposes real gaps that need to be addressed).

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
- Business Goal: Platform Security, Performance, Reliability
- Value Impact: Security vulnerabilities and performance issues directly impact customer trust and platform reliability
- Strategic Impact: Core security and performance foundation for enterprise AI workload optimization
