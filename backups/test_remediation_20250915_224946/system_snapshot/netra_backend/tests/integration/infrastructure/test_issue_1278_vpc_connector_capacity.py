Integration Tests for Issue #1278 - VPC Connector Capacity Constraints

These tests focus on VPC connector operational limits that Issue #1263 fix didn't address.
Tests simulate VPC connector capacity pressure to reproduce Issue #1278 conditions.

Expected Result: Tests should FAIL initially, exposing VPC connector capacity limits
