"""
WebSocket Message Routing and Delivery Integration Tests

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise) - Core messaging infrastructure
- Business Goal: Reliable message delivery enables chat functionality and real-time AI interactions
- Value Impact: CRITICAL - Message routing failures break chat (90% of platform business value)
- Strategic/Revenue Impact: $500K+ ARR depends on messages reaching the correct users at the right time

CRITICAL ROUTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Messages must reach intended recipients only (user isolation)
2. Message ordering must be preserved for coherent conversations
3. Message delivery must be confirmed and tracked
4. Routing must handle concurrent users without cross-contamination
5. Failed deliveries must be handled gracefully with retries

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Uses REAL WebSocket connections and REAL message routing (NO MOCKS per CLAUDE.md)
2. Tests message routing across multiple concurrent users
3. Validates message ordering preservation during high load
4. Ensures proper error handling and delivery confirmation
5. Tests thread-based message routing isolation

This test validates the core message routing infrastructure that ensures users receive
their AI responses and notifications without interference from other users' sessions.
