"""
Integration Tests for Issue #1278 - Database Connectivity Failures (Non-Docker)

These tests focus on reproducing real database connectivity issues that cause
SMD Phase 3 failures in staging environment. Tests use real database infrastructure
(without Docker) to simulate network timeouts, connection failures, and Cloud SQL
connectivity issues that lead to application startup failures.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal - Staging Environment Stability
- Business Goal: Database Infrastructure Reliability
- Value Impact: Ensures robust database connectivity handling under real network conditions
- Strategic Impact: Prevents $500K+ ARR validation pipeline from failing due to database connectivity issues

Test Strategy:
1. Use real PostgreSQL connections with simulated failure conditions
2. Test Cloud SQL VPC connector timeout scenarios
3. Validate database connection pool behavior under stress
4. Test network partition and recovery scenarios
5. Verify connection timeout handling with real database instances

NO DOCKER DEPENDENCIES: These tests use real PostgreSQL instances to test
actual database connectivity patterns that occur in staging environment.

Expected Behavior (FAILING tests initially):
- Database connections should timeout realistically under network stress
- Connection pools should handle failures gracefully
- Cloud SQL socket connectivity should be resilient
- Real network conditions should be properly simulated
