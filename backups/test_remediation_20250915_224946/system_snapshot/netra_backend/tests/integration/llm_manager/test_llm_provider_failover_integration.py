Test LLM Provider Failover Integration

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
- Business Goal: Ensure service continuity during provider outages
- Value Impact: Maintains chat availability when primary LLM provider fails
- Strategic Impact: Prevents revenue loss from service disruptions

RELIABILITY CRITICAL: Provider failover must work seamlessly to maintain business value delivery.
This validates that LLM operations continue when providers fail, with proper user context preservation.
