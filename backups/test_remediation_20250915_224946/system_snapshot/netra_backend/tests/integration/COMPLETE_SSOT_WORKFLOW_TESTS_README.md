## Test Execution

### Prerequisites

1. **Real Services Required**: All tests use real instances, NO MOCKS
2. **Environment Setup**: Tests use IsolatedEnvironment for proper isolation
3. **Database**: Tests require access to test database (PostgreSQL)
4. **WebSocket**: Tests require WebSocket infrastructure

### Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all SSOT workflow integration tests
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file netra_backend/tests/integration/test_complete_ssot_workflow_integration.py --real-services

# Run specific test
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file netra_backend/tests/integration/test_complete_ssot_workflow_integration.py::TestCompleteSSotWorkflowIntegration::test_complete_user_chat_workflow --real-services

# Run with coverage
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file netra_backend/tests/integration/test_complete_ssot_workflow_integration.py --real-services --coverage
```

### Test Markers

All tests use proper pytest markers:
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Integration test category
- `@pytest.mark.real_services` - Requires real service infrastructure

## Test Structure

### Base Class

Tests inherit from `BaseIntegrationTest` following TEST_CREATION_GUIDE.md patterns:

```python
class TestCompleteSSotWorkflowIntegration(BaseIntegrationTest):
    """Complete SSOT workflow integration tests."""
```

### Test Method Pattern

Each test follows a 5-phase structure:

1. **Phase 1**: Environment and Configuration Setup
2. **Phase 2**: SSOT Component Initialization  
3. **Phase 3**: Workflow Execution Simulation
4. **Phase 4**: Multi-Component Integration
5. **Phase 5**: Complete Workflow Validation

### Business Value Justification (BVJ)

Every test includes comprehensive BVJ documentation:

```python
"""
Test Description

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Target user segments
- Business Goal: Specific business objective
- Value Impact: How it improves user experience
- Strategic Impact: Annual value and revenue impact
"""
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Environment Isolation Issues**
   - Ensure `env.enable_isolation()` is called in setup
   - Use `env.disable_isolation(restore_original=True)` in teardown

2. **WebSocket Mock Issues**
   - Verify `AsyncMock` is properly configured
   - Ensure `send_json` method is mocked correctly

3. **State Manager Issues**
   - Call `state_manager.clear_all_state()` in teardown
   - Verify proper scope and user_id usage

4. **Configuration Manager Issues**
   - Use appropriate ConfigurationScope for each setting
   - Verify ConfigurationSource priority order
