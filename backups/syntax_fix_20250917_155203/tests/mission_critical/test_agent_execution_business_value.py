P0 Mission Critical Agent Execution Business Value Test

MISSION CRITICAL: This test validates the CORE of Netra's value proposition - successful 
agent execution that delivers actionable business insights to users.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise) 
- Business Goal: Core Platform Value Delivery - Agent execution MUST work
- Value Impact: Validates agents execute successfully and deliver actionable business insights
- Strategic Impact: $500K+ ARR depends on agents executing and delivering value through chat

CRITICAL: If this test fails, the entire platform is worthless because:
1. Agents don't execute successfully 
2. Users don't receive actionable insights
3. WebSocket events don't deliver real-time value
4. No business value is generated from AI interactions

This test validates:
- Complete agent execution pipeline (tool dispatcher, execution engine, context isolation)
- All 5 critical WebSocket events are sent during execution
- Agent results contain actionable business insights (cost savings, optimizations, etc.)
- User context isolation works correctly for multi-user scenarios
- Data persistence and result retrieval work end-to-end
- Execution completes within reasonable business timeframe (< 30s)

ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE:
- Uses real services and real agent execution (NO mocks per CLAUDE.md)
- Follows TEST_CREATION_GUIDE.md standards exactly
- Uses SSOT patterns from test_framework/
- Validates business value delivery, not just technical functionality

        2. All 5 WebSocket events are sent during execution  
        3. Agent results contain actionable business insights (cost savings, optimizations, etc.)

        MISSION CRITICAL: Validate user context isolation during agent execution.
        
        Multi-user isolation is critical for business value because:
        1. Prevents data leakage between users
        2. Ensures each user sees only their results
        3. Maintains compliance and security
        4. Enables concurrent execution for multiple users
        
        Business Value: Proper isolation enables serving multiple users
        simultaneously, increasing platform capacity and revenue potential.
