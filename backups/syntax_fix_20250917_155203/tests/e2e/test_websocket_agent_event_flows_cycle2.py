E2E Tests for Complete WebSocket Agent Event Flows - Cycle 2

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
- Business Goal: Ensure complete agent-to-user event delivery in production-like environment
- Value Impact: Users experience seamless real-time AI interaction with full transparency
- Strategic Impact: Core business value delivery - this IS the chat experience customers pay for

CRITICAL: These tests validate the complete business value delivery chain.
If these fail, customers cannot see AI working and will not pay for the service.

E2E AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENT: All tests MUST use real authentication per CLAUDE.md
