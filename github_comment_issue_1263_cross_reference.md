## ðŸ”— Cross-Reference Update: Issue #1184 Resolution

**Related Issue**: Issue #1184 (WebSocket async/await compatibility) has been **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**.

### Connection to Issue #1263

Issue #1263 (database timeout configuration) was identified as a **contributing factor** to the WebSocket failures that led to Issue #1184. The database timeout issues were causing delays in WebSocket initialization, which exacerbated the async/await compatibility problems.

### Resolution Status

âœ… **Issue #1263**: Database timeout configuration fixed (25.0s timeout implemented)
âœ… **Issue #1184**: WebSocket async/await compatibility issues resolved

### Technical Impact

The database timeout fix in Issue #1263 provided a stable foundation that allowed the WebSocket async/await fixes in Issue #1184 to be properly validated. Both issues working together have restored:

- âœ… Staging environment stability
- âœ… WebSocket connection reliability
- âœ… $500K+ ARR real-time chat functionality
- âœ… Production deployment readiness

### Validation Results

With both issues resolved:
- Database connections: âœ… Stable with 25.0s timeout
- WebSocket operations: âœ… 5/5 tests passing
- Integration: âœ… Ready for production validation

The collaborative resolution of both infrastructure issues ensures robust WebSocket functionality for production deployment.
