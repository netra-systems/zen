- **Enhanced Serialization**: Bulletproof message handling with 5+ fallback strategies
- **Connection Pooling**: Reusable connections with LRU eviction
- **Timeout Handling**: <2s response requirement with optimized retry logic

**Key Metrics:**
- **Memory Cleanup**: Automated every 30 seconds
- **Send Timeout**: Reduced to 2.0s for faster response
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with 0.5s base delay
- **Connection Age Limit**: 24-hour maximum connection age

### 2. Enhanced Heartbeat Manager (`websocket_core/heartbeat_manager.py`)

**Thread Safety Improvements:**
- **Async Locks**: Comprehensive locking for heartbeat and stats operations
- **Environment-Aware Config**: Staging (90s timeout), Production (75s), Development (60s)
- **Progressive Health Checks**: Multi-level validation with grace periods
- **Resurrection Logic**: Automatic connection recovery on activity detection
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Orphaned ping detection and removal

**Key Features:**
- **Ping Time Validation**: Outlier detection and dampening (>30s rejected)
- **Clock Skew Handling**: Negative time detection and correction
- **Stale Connection Detection**: 2x timeout threshold for cleanup
- **Activity Tracking**: Sub-100ms rapid activity detection

### 3. Error Recovery Enhancements

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
```python
if failure_count >= self.circuit_breaker_threshold:
    logger.error(f"Circuit breaker activated for {conn_id}")
    self.failed_connections.add(conn_id)
    conn_info["is_healthy"] = False
    asyncio.create_task(self._schedule_cleanup(conn_id, delay=1.0))
```

**Exponential Backoff Retry:**
```python
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(websocket.send_json(message_dict), timeout=self.send_timeout)
        return True
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        delay = self.base_backoff * (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 0.1)
        await asyncio.sleep(delay)
```
