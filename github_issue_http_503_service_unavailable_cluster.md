# New GitHub Issue - HTTP 503 Service Unavailable Cluster

## Issue Details

**Title:** GCP-regression | P0 | HTTP 503 Service Unavailable affecting health checks and WebSocket endpoints

**Labels:** claude-code-generated-issue, P0, regression, service-availability, health-checks, websocket

**Body:**

## Summary
Critical service availability issues affecting core chat functionality and health monitoring. Multiple 503 Service Unavailable errors detected across health check endpoints and WebSocket connections, indicating severe service stress or resource exhaustion.

## Error Details
- **Time Range**: 2025-09-16T02:03:41 UTC to 2025-09-16T03:03:41 UTC
- **Frequency**: 14 documented instances in 1 hour
- **Severity**: P0 CRITICAL
- **Impact**: Core chat functionality and health monitoring compromised

## Affected Endpoints & Failure Counts

### Health Check Failures (6 instances)
```
/health endpoint returning 503 Service Unavailable
Response latencies: 2-12 seconds (indicating service stress)
```

### WebSocket Connection Failures (4 instances)
```
/ws WebSocket endpoint returning 503 Service Unavailable
Chat functionality severely impacted
```

### Direct Cloud Run Health Check Failures (4 instances)
```
Direct Cloud Run health checks failing with 503 responses
Infrastructure-level service availability issues
```

## Performance Indicators
- **Response Latencies**: 2-12 seconds (extremely high)
- **HTTP Status Code**: 503 Service Unavailable
- **Pattern**: Consistent across multiple endpoint types
- **Frequency**: Regular failures over 1-hour window

## Business Impact
- **Core Chat Functionality**: Severely compromised
- **Service Availability**: Intermittent outages
- **Health Monitoring**: Health checks failing
- **WebSocket Connections**: Connection establishment failures
- **Revenue Risk**: $500K+ ARR Golden Path services experiencing degradation
- **User Experience**: Chat interface becoming unreliable

## Technical Analysis

### Service Stress Indicators
- High response latencies (2-12s) suggest resource exhaustion
- 503 responses indicate server unavailability rather than routing issues
- Multiple endpoint types affected suggests systemic issue

### Affected Infrastructure
- Health check endpoints (`/health`)
- WebSocket endpoints (`/ws`)
- Cloud Run service health monitoring
- Load balancer health verification

## Related Context
This may be related to recent infrastructure issues:
- **Issue #1278**: Database timeout & FastAPI lifespan (ongoing)
- **Issue #1021**: WebSocket event structure fixes (recently resolved)
- Recent staging deployment stress

## Root Cause Investigation Required

### Infrastructure Health Check
- [ ] **Cloud Run Instance Status**: Verify service instance health and resource utilization
- [ ] **Memory/CPU Usage**: Check for resource exhaustion or memory leaks
- [ ] **Database Connection Pool**: Verify database connection health
- [ ] **Load Balancer Configuration**: Validate health check thresholds and timeouts

### Service Configuration Review
- [ ] **Health Check Timeout**: Review health check configuration and response time limits
- [ ] **WebSocket Resource Management**: Verify WebSocket connection management
- [ ] **Service Startup Sequence**: Validate deterministic startup completion
- [ ] **Resource Limits**: Review Cloud Run memory and CPU allocations

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] **GCP Error Reporting**: Review detailed error traces for 503 responses
- [ ] **Cloud Run Metrics**: Analyze request latency and error rate metrics
- [ ] **Application Logs**: Deep dive into application-level error patterns
- [ ] **Infrastructure Metrics**: Review underlying infrastructure health

## Immediate Actions Required

### Short-term Stabilization
- [ ] Restart affected Cloud Run services if resource exhaustion confirmed
- [ ] Increase Cloud Run memory allocation if memory issues detected
- [ ] Adjust health check timeouts if startup sequence takes longer
- [ ] Monitor service recovery and error rate reduction

### Long-term Resolution
- [ ] Implement proper resource monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Review and optimize service startup sequence
- [ ] Enhance health check robustness and error handling
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker patterns for downstream dependencies

## Priority: P0 Critical
This represents a critical regression in service availability affecting core business functionality. The Golden Path user flow (login â†’ AI chat responses) is at risk due to these availability issues.

## Escalation Path
1. **Immediate**: Infrastructure team review for resource/configuration issues
2. **Development**: Review recent deployments for regression introduction
3. **Monitoring**: Enhance alerting for 503 patterns and service availability
