# E2E Agent Test Infrastructure Failures - GCP Staging Connectivity and Import Issues

## Summary

Comprehensive analysis of the current e2e test infrastructure reveals critical failures preventing e2e agent test execution. The primary issues center around GCP staging environment connectivity problems, missing test framework dependencies, infrastructure misconfiguration, and Pydantic model field errors.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. GCP Staging Connectivity (WebSocket endpoints returning HTTP 503 and timeout errors)
**Severity**: P0 - Critical/Blocking
**Impact**: Complete e2e test suite non-functional for staging validation

### 2. Import Errors (Missing test framework dependencies and malformed imports)
**Severity**: P1 - High
**Impact**: Individual e2e tests fail even when infrastructure issues are resolved

### 3. Infrastructure Problems (Staging services appear down or misconfigured)
**Severity**: P0 - Critical/Blocking
**Impact**: End-to-end testing infrastructure completely non-functional

### 4. Model Definition Issues (Pydantic model field errors in test tools)
**Severity**: P2 - Medium
**Impact**: Deprecation warnings and technical debt affecting test reliability

## Environment Details

**Target Environment**: GCP Staging
- **GCP Project**: netra-staging
- **Region**: us-central1
- **Backend Service**: netra-backend (Cloud Run)
- **Auth Service**: netra-auth (Cloud Run)
- **Frontend Service**: netra-frontend (Cloud Run)

**Test Infrastructure**:
- **E2E Test Files**: 100+ test files discovered
- **Test Collection Status**: 0 tests collected (all failed collection)
- **Docker Infrastructure**: Missing critical files and compose configurations
- **Configuration Issues**: 5+ pytest configuration problems identified

## Error Details from Test Runs

### Docker Infrastructure Failures
```
ERROR: lstat /Users/anthony/Desktop/netra-apex/docker/dockerfiles: no such file or directory
CRITICAL: Required E2E compose file not found: /Users/anthony/Desktop/netra-apex/docker-compose.alpine-test.yml
ERROR: pull access denied for netra-alpine-test-migration, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'
```

### Import and Dependency Failures
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'TestClient' from 'tests.e2e.harness_utils'
ERROR: Unknown config option: collect_ignore
ERROR: 'mission_critical' not found in `markers` configuration option
WARNING: Redis libraries not available - Redis fixtures will fail
```

### Deprecation Warnings (Pydantic v2 Migration)
```
DeprecationWarning: shared.logging.unified_logger_factory is deprecated
DeprecationWarning: Support for class-based `config` is deprecated, use ConfigDict instead
DeprecationWarning: json_encoders is deprecated (Pydantic)
DeprecationWarning: Importing WebSocketManager from deprecated path
```

## Impact Assessment

**Business Impact**:
- $500K+ ARR functionality cannot be validated through e2e tests
- Complete e2e testing infrastructure non-functional
- Deployment quality assurance compromised
- Development velocity reduced due to testing bottlenecks

**Technical Impact**:
- 0% E2E test functionality
- No validation of critical user journeys
- Staging environment reliability unknown
- CI/CD pipeline confidence reduced

## Five Whys Analysis

### Issue 1: WebSocket endpoints returning HTTP 503 and timeout errors

**Why 1**: Why are WebSocket endpoints returning HTTP 503?
- GCP staging services are not responding or are down

**Why 2**: Why are GCP staging services not responding?
- Cloud Run services may not be properly deployed or configured

**Why 3**: Why are Cloud Run services not properly deployed?
- Recent deployment may have failed or services may be scaled to zero

**Why 4**: Why would recent deployment fail or services scale to zero?
- Missing environment variables, failed health checks, or cost optimization settings

**Why 5**: Why are environment variables missing or health checks failing?
- **Root Cause**: Staging deployment pipeline may have configuration drift from production, or secrets/environment variables are not properly synchronized between environments

### Issue 2: Import errors in test framework dependencies

**Why 1**: Why are there import errors for TestClient in harness_utils?
- TestClient class exists but may not be properly exported or has dependency issues

**Why 2**: Why is TestClient not properly exported?
- Analysis shows TestClient is implemented in harness_utils.py but dependency on requests library may be missing

**Why 3**: Why would requests library dependency be missing?
- E2E test environment may not have all required dependencies installed

**Why 4**: Why would e2e test dependencies not be installed?
- requirements.txt may not include all e2e-specific dependencies or installation step may be skipped

**Why 5**: Why would installation steps be skipped or requirements incomplete?
- **Root Cause**: E2E test infrastructure setup process is not properly integrated into CI/CD pipeline, leading to incomplete dependency installation and environment preparation

### Issue 3: Staging services appearing down or misconfigured

**Why 1**: Why do staging services appear down or misconfigured?
- Health check endpoints are failing or services are not accessible

**Why 2**: Why are health check endpoints failing?
- Services may not be running or network connectivity issues exist

**Why 3**: Why would services not be running or have network issues?
- GCP Cloud Run services may be experiencing scaling issues or VPC connectivity problems

**Why 4**: Why would Cloud Run services have scaling or VPC issues?
- Resource limits, cold start problems, or network security group configurations

**Why 5**: Why would these infrastructure issues persist?
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient monitoring and alerting for staging environment infrastructure health, leading to undetected service degradation and configuration drift

### Issue 4: Pydantic model field errors in test tools

**Why 1**: Why are there Pydantic model field errors?
- Code is using deprecated Pydantic v1 patterns with Pydantic v2 installed

**Why 2**: Why is deprecated Pydantic v1 code being used with v2?
- Migration from Pydantic v1 to v2 was incomplete or not properly tested

**Why 3**: Why was the Pydantic migration incomplete?
- Large codebase with many models makes migration complex and error-prone

**Why 4**: Why wasn't this caught during migration?
- Insufficient test coverage for deprecation warnings or migration testing

**Why 5**: Why was migration testing insufficient?
- **Root Cause**: No systematic approach to library migration testing and deprecation warning monitoring, leading to incomplete migrations and technical debt accumulation

## Relationship to Existing Issues
