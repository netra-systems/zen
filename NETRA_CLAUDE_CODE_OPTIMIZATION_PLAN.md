    def __init__(self, max_tokens: int = 200000):  # Opus 4.1 context window
        self.max_tokens = max_tokens
        self.target_usage = int(max_tokens * 0.7)  # Leave 30% buffer
        
    async def allocate_tokens(self, content_types: Dict[str, int]) -> TokenAllocation:
        """
        Allocate tokens by priority:
        1. Current task context (40%)
        2. Relevant code files (30%) 
        3. Conversation history (20%)
        4. System prompts and tools (10%)
        """
```

### 3.2 Dynamic Content Loading

```python
class DynamicContentLoader:
    """Loads content progressively to optimize token usage"""
    
    async def load_content_on_demand(self, task: TaskContext) -> ContentPlan:
        """
        Phase 1: Essential context only (core files, immediate task)
        Phase 2: Related context if needed (dependencies, similar patterns)

    B --> C[Security Requirements Analysis]
    C --> D[Code Generation Agent] 
    D --> E[Testing Agent]
    E --> F[Documentation Agent]
    F --> G[Integration Agent]
    
    subgraph "Parallel Execution"

## 12. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### 12.1 Technical Risks

**Context Management Complexity:**
- **Risk:** Complex context optimization may introduce bugs or miss important information
- **Mitigation:** Extensive testing, fallback to full context, gradual rollout
- **Monitoring:** Context relevance scoring and user feedback systems

**Integration Stability:**  
- **Risk:** Claude Code integration may break with updates
- **Mitigation:** Version pinning, backward compatibility testing, graceful degradation
- **Monitoring:** Integration health checks and automated testing

### 12.2 Business Risks

**User Adoption:**
- **Risk:** Users may not see immediate value or may resist change
- **Mitigation:** Transparent optimization benefits, opt-in features, clear value demonstration
- **Monitoring:** User engagement metrics and satisfaction surveys

**Competition:**
- **Risk:** Other optimization solutions may emerge
- **Mitigation:** Continuous innovation, strong user experience, patent protection where applicable
- **Monitoring:** Competitive analysis and feature differentiation tracking

### 12.3 Privacy and Security

**Code Privacy:**
- **Risk:** User code analyzed for optimization may contain sensitive information
- **Mitigation:** Local processing options, encryption, strict data handling policies
- **Monitoring:** Security audits and compliance verification

**Data Handling:**
- **Risk:** Optimization data storage and usage may violate privacy expectations  
- **Mitigation:** Clear privacy policies, minimal data retention, user control over data
- **Monitoring:** Privacy compliance audits and user consent tracking

## Conclusion

This comprehensive plan outlines how Netra Apex's multi-agent architecture can be leveraged to create a sophisticated Claude Code optimization platform. The approach focuses on:

1. **Intelligent Context Management** - Reducing token usage through smart context pruning and caching
2. **Multi-Agent Workflows** - Handling complex tasks through specialized agent coordination
3. **Continuous Learning** - Building persistent knowledge that improves over time
4. **Performance Analytics** - Data-driven optimization and improvement
5. **Seamless Integration** - Transparent optimization that enhances rather than disrupts workflows

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 40-60% reduction in token costs for regular users
- Significant improvement in complex task success rates  
- Enhanced developer productivity through intelligent automation
- New revenue stream for Netra Apex platform
- Market leadership in AI development tool optimization

The implementation roadmap provides a clear path from basic optimization to a comprehensive platform that can transform how developers interact with Claude Code, making it more efficient, cost-effective, and powerful.

**Next Steps:**
1. Validate technical feasibility with proof-of-concept
2. Conduct user research to prioritize features
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation with core optimization features
4. Establish partnerships with Claude Code team for optimal integration
5. Develop go-to-market strategy for optimization platform

This optimization platform positions Netra Apex at the forefront of AI development tool enhancement, creating significant value for developers while establishing a new market category in AI workflow optimization.
