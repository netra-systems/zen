- **Merge Conflicts:** Requires conflict resolution before merge
- **No CI Validation:** No automated checks run on PR
- **No Code Review:** No human reviews performed
- **Line Number Drift:** Referenced lines (298, 393, 461, 539) may have shifted

### üî¥ HIGH RISK MITIGATION
- **Conflict Resolution Required:** Must resolve merge conflicts carefully
- **Manual Testing Needed:** Verify fix still works after conflict resolution
- **Staging Re-validation:** Re-test in staging after merge conflict resolution

---

## Quality Assessment

### ‚úÖ POSITIVE INDICATORS
- **Clean Implementation:** Surgical change with clear purpose
- **Extensive Documentation:** Comprehensive validation reports
- **Performance Validated:** 0.155s connection time confirmed
- **Standard Compliance:** Full RFC 6455 WebSocket protocol adherence

- **Missing CI/CD:** No automated validation pipeline

---

## Merge Readiness Assessment

### ‚ùå MERGE BLOCKED - Prerequisites Required

#### Required Actions Before Merge:
1. **üö® CRITICAL - Resolve Merge Conflicts**
   - Carefully merge changes to `websocket_ssot.py`
   - Verify line numbers still align with intended changes
   - Test conflict resolution doesn't break functionality

2. **‚ö° URGENT - Manual Validation**
   - Run TDD test suite after conflict resolution
   - Verify staging deployment still works
   - Confirm WebSocket connections succeed with subprotocol fix

3. **üìã RECOMMENDED - Review Process**
   - Code review of conflict resolution changes
   - Business stakeholder approval for $500K+ ARR critical fix
   - CI/CD pipeline validation if available

#### Post-Merge Requirements:
1. **Production Deployment:** Critical for revenue protection
2. **Monitoring:** WebSocket connection success rate tracking
3. **User Testing:** Validate real-time chat functionality
4. **Analytics:** Monitor Golden Path completion rates

---

## Conflict Resolution Guidance

### Expected Conflict Locations
The conflicts likely occur because the current `websocket_ssot.py` file has been modified since this branch was created. Based on current file content, the actual line numbers may have shifted.

### Current vs PR Expected Lines
**PR expects to change:**
- Line 298, 393, 461, 539

**Current file shows websocket.accept() calls at:**
- Line 398, 499, 573, 657

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Identify all current `await websocket.accept()` calls in the file
2. Add `subprotocol="jwt-auth"` parameter to each call
3. Maintain all other functionality unchanged
4. Test that all WebSocket modes (main, factory, isolated, legacy) work correctly

---

## Recommendation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL WITH IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

**BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION:**
- **P0 Critical Issue:** Affecting $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality
- **High Business Value:** Restores 90% of platform value delivery
- **Low Technical Risk:** Minimal, RFC-compliant change with extensive validation
- **Revenue Impact:** Direct impact on primary revenue-generating user workflow

**ACTION PLAN:**
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Resolve merge conflicts carefully
2. **VALIDATE:** Run comprehensive test suite after conflict resolution  
3. **DEPLOY:** Immediate staging validation and production deployment
4. **MONITOR:** Track WebSocket connection success rates post-deployment

**MERGE CONDITIONS:**
- ‚úÖ Conflicts resolved without breaking existing functionality
- ‚úÖ TDD test suite passes after conflict resolution
- ‚úÖ Staging validation confirms fix works
- ‚úÖ No regressions in WebSocket connectivity

This PR addresses a critical business issue with a clean, well-tested solution and should be prioritized for immediate merge after conflict resolution.
