# JWT Authentication Flow Documentation

## Problem
The complex multi-service authentication system lacks comprehensive visual documentation, making troubleshooting and onboarding difficult.

## Missing Documentation Identified
Based on analysis of issue #930, critical documentation gaps include:

### Missing Visual Documentation:
- [ ] **System-wide JWT authentication flow diagram**
- [ ] **Multi-service authentication sequence diagram**
- [ ] **Environment variable precedence flow chart**
- [ ] **GCP Secret Manager integration architecture diagram**
- [ ] **Service-to-service authentication patterns**

### Missing Written Documentation:
- [ ] **JWT configuration precedence rules**
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide for JWT issues**
- [ ] **Service-specific authentication requirements**
- [ ] **Environment-specific configuration guide**

## Solution: Comprehensive Documentation Suite

### Phase 1: Core Flow Diagrams
Create mermaid diagrams for:

1. **JWT Authentication Flow**
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[User Request] --> B[Service Receives Request]
       B --> C[Extract JWT Token]
       C --> D[Validate Token with JWT Secret]
       D --> E[Allow/Deny Access]
   ```

2. **Multi-Service Authentication Sequence**
   - Frontend → Auth Service → Backend flow
   - WebSocket authentication flow
   - Service-to-service authentication

3. **Configuration Precedence Hierarchy**
   - Environment-specific secrets (JWT_SECRET_STAGING)
   - Generic secrets (JWT_SECRET_KEY)
   - Legacy fallbacks (JWT_SECRET)
   - GCP Secret Manager integration

### Phase 2: Architecture Documentation
- [ ] Service authentication boundaries
- [ ] Secret management architecture
- [ ] Token lifecycle management
- [ ] Cross-service communication patterns

### Phase 3: Operational Documentation
- [ ] Configuration troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Environment setup procedures
- [ ] Security best practices
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup

## Business Impact
- **Segment:** Platform/Internal/Developer Experience
- **Business Goal:** Reduce debugging time and improve system maintainability
- **Value Impact:** Faster issue resolution and easier onboarding
- **Strategic Impact:** Establishes documentation standards for complex systems

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete visual flow diagrams for all authentication paths
- [ ] Written documentation covers all configuration scenarios
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide resolves common JWT issues
- [ ] New team members can understand authentication flow
- [ ] Documentation is kept up-to-date with system changes

```

## Implementation Plan
1. **Assessment**: Review current authentication flows and identify all paths
2. **Design**: Create comprehensive mermaid diagrams
3. **Documentation**: Write detailed explanations for each component
4. **Validation**: Test documentation with real scenarios
5. **Integration**: Link documentation into main project docs

## Related Issues
- **Parent Issue:** #930 (JWT configuration failures)
- **Architecture**: [JWT SSOT Consolidation issue] (consolidation work)
- **Infrastructure**: [JWT Staging Configuration issue] (immediate fix)

## Timeline
- **Priority:** P3 (Important for long-term maintenance)
- **Estimate:** 1 sprint
- **Dependencies:** Understanding of current authentication flows

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in time-to-resolution for JWT-related issues
- Improved developer onboarding experience
- Fewer repeat questions about authentication setup
- Better incident response for authentication failures

## Notes
- Documentation should be created **after** SSOT consolidation is complete
- Focus on practical troubleshooting over theoretical completeness
- Include real-world examples and common error scenarios
- Keep diagrams simple and focused on business value
