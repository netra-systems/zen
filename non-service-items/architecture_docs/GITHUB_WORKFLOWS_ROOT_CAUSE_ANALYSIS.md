# GitHub Workflows Root Cause Analysis and Resolution

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive root cause analysis of GitHub workflow failures and their resolution through local testing with ACT. The primary issue identified was ACT not mounting repository files into containers by default, causing all file-dependent workflow steps to fail.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **CRITICAL: ACT Repository Mount Issue**
- **Problem**: ACT creates empty working directory without `--bind` flag
- **Impact**: All workflows fail to find repository files (requirements.txt, test_runner.py, etc.)
- **Solution**: Configure ACT with `--bind` flag in `.actrc` file

### 2. **HIGH: External GitHub Actions Authentication**
- **Problem**: actions/setup-python, actions/checkout require GitHub authentication
- **Impact**: Cannot use standard GitHub Actions in local ACT environment
- **Solution**: Create ACT-compatible workflows without external dependencies

### 3. **MEDIUM: Complex YAML Syntax Issues**
- **Problem**: Multi-line Python scripts in YAML causing parser errors
- **Impact**: Workflows fail validation before execution (line 211 errors)
- **Solution**: Use heredoc or separate script files for complex scripts

### 4. **LOW: Runner Mapping Issues**
- **Problem**: Custom runners (warp-custom-default) not recognized by ACT
- **Impact**: Workflows use wrong container images
- **Solution**: Map custom runners in `.actrc` configuration

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ACT Configuration File (`.actrc`)

```bash
# ACT Configuration for Local GitHub Actions Testing

# Always bind mount the repository
--bind

# Use Linux AMD64 architecture
--container-architecture linux/amd64

# Default runner image mappings
-P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest
-P ubuntu-22.04=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-22.04
-P ubuntu-20.04=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-20.04
-P warp-custom-default=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest
-P warp-custom-test=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest

# Don't pull images if they exist
--pull=false

# Reuse containers between runs
--reuse
```

### 2. ACT-Compatible Test Workflows

Created simplified workflows that work without external GitHub Actions:
- `.github/workflows/test-smoke-simple.yml` - Basic smoke test workflow
- `.github/workflows/test-act-simple.yml` - Minimal ACT validation workflow

Key features:
- No external action dependencies
- Repository file verification steps
- Environment detection (ACT vs GitHub Actions)
- Simple script execution without complex YAML

### 3. Workflow Script Simplification

**Before (causing errors):**
```yaml
run: |
  python3 -c "
  import sys
  print('test')
  "
```

**After (working):**
```yaml
run: |
  cat > test.py << 'EOF'
  import sys
  print('test')
  EOF
  python3 test.py
```

## Validation Results

### Test Commands
```bash
# List all workflows
act -l

# Test smoke workflow with binding
act push -W .github/workflows/test-smoke-simple.yml --bind

# Dry run test
act push -W .github/workflows/test-act-simple.yml -n

# Full test with secrets
act workflow_dispatch --secret-file .secrets
```

### Results
- ✅ Repository files properly mounted with `--bind`
- ✅ All file verification steps pass
- ✅ Python dependencies install successfully
- ✅ Test runner executes when present
- ✅ Workflows complete without errors

## Best Practices

### For ACT Testing
1. **Always use `--bind` flag** or configure in `.actrc`
2. **Create ACT-specific test workflows** for validation
3. **Test file existence** before dependent steps
4. **Use simple scripts** avoiding complex YAML syntax
5. **Document ACT requirements** in workflow comments

### For Workflow Development
1. **Test locally first** with ACT before pushing
2. **Maintain simplified versions** of complex workflows
3. **Avoid external actions** in ACT-compatible workflows
4. **Use heredoc or files** for multi-line scripts
5. **Include environment detection** for ACT vs GitHub Actions

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Created `.actrc` with proper defaults
2. ✅ Added ACT-compatible test workflows
3. ✅ Updated `learnings.xml` with findings
4. ✅ Simplified complex workflow scripts

### Ongoing Actions
1. Run ACT validation before pushing workflow changes
2. Maintain separate ACT test workflows
3. Regular workflow health checks
4. Document ACT compatibility requirements

## Error Messages Explained

### "No file matched to [**/requirements.txt]"
- **Cause**: ACT not mounting repository files
- **Fix**: Use `--bind` flag

### "authentication required: Invalid username or token"
- **Cause**: External GitHub Actions need authentication
- **Fix**: Use ACT-compatible workflows without external actions

### "yaml: line 211: could not find expected ':'"
- **Cause**: Complex multi-line scripts in YAML
- **Fix**: Use heredoc or separate script files

## Testing Checklist

Before pushing workflow changes:
- [ ] Test with ACT locally: `act push -W workflow.yml`
- [ ] Verify file mounting: Check for repository files
- [ ] Run with dry run: `act -n`
- [ ] Test with different events: `push`, `pull_request`, `workflow_dispatch`
- [ ] Validate YAML syntax: `python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('workflow.yml'))"`

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks
- Review workflow execution logs
- Update ACT to latest version
- Test critical workflows locally

### Monthly Tasks
- Review and update `.actrc` configuration
- Audit workflow complexity
- Update ACT-compatible test workflows

## Conclusion

The root cause analysis revealed that the primary issue was ACT's default behavior of not mounting repository files. The implementation of proper ACT configuration and simplified workflows has resolved all identified issues. Local workflow testing with ACT is now fully functional and should be part of the standard development process.
