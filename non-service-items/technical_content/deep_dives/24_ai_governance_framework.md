# AI Governance Framework: Engineering Trust, Compliance, and Accountability at Scale

## The Governance Imperative in Enterprise AI

Ungoverned AI systems expose organizations to $25 million average regulatory penalties, destroy customer trust through biased decisions, and create existential risks through uncontrolled autonomous actions. While 92% of enterprises recognize AI governance as critical, only 15% have implemented comprehensive frameworks. Organizations with mature AI governance frameworks report 85% reduction in compliance violations, 90% improvement in stakeholder trust, and 70% faster AI deployment through streamlined approval processes. This technical guide reveals the governance architectures, control mechanisms, and accountability frameworks that transform AI from a liability into a trusted enterprise capability.
