# Error Recovery Patterns: Building Resilient AI Systems That Self-Heal

## The Hidden Cost of AI System Failures

AI system failures cost enterprises an average of $5.6 million per year through cascading errors, silent failures, and extended recovery times that compound across automated processes. Unlike traditional software where errors are immediately visible, AI failures often manifest as degraded accuracy or subtle biases that go undetected for weeks. Organizations implementing comprehensive error recovery patterns report 92% reduction in system downtime, 85% faster mean time to recovery, and 70% fewer cascading failures. This technical guide reveals the recovery architectures, failure detection mechanisms, and self-healing strategies that transform brittle AI systems into resilient platforms capable of automatic recovery from any failure mode.
