# AI Quality Assurance: Engineering Reliability and Trust in Machine Learning Systems

## The Trust Crisis in AI Systems

Poor AI quality costs enterprises $12 million annually through incorrect predictions, biased decisions, and system failures that erode customer trust. Unlike traditional software where bugs are deterministic, AI quality issues manifest as statistical degradations, hidden biases, and emergent behaviors that escape conventional testing. Organizations implementing comprehensive AI quality assurance frameworks report 95% reduction in production failures, 80% improvement in model fairness, and 70% increase in stakeholder confidence.
