# Sub-Agent Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to implement the SubAgent specification.

## Phase 1: Core Agent Refactoring

1.  **Update `app/agents/base.py`:**
    *   Add `name` and `description` attributes to the `BaseSubAgent` class.
    *   Add a `run_in_background` method to the `BaseSubAgent` class to allow for asynchronous execution of agents.

2.  **Update `app/agents/supervisor.py`:**
    *   Refactor the `Supervisor` to be more robust and extensible.
    *   The `Supervisor` will be responsible for creating and managing the lifecycle of the sub-agents.
    *   It will use the `run_in_background` method to run the sub-agents concurrently when possible.
    *   It will manage the state of the overall process and provide updates to the user via WebSockets.
    *   The `Supervisor` will be responsible for orchestrating the flow of data between the sub-agents, as defined in the spec.

## Phase 2: Sub-Agent Implementation

1.  **Update Sub-Agent Implementations:**
    *   Update each sub-agent in `app/agents/` to include a `name` and `description`.
    *   Flesh out the `run` method of each sub-agent to be more comprehensive and include the complete prompt template and LLM usage as specified.
    *   Ensure each sub-agent has clear entry and exit conditions.

2.  **Implement `ToolDispatcher`:**
    *   The `ToolDispatcher` will be responsible for providing tools to the sub-agents.
    *   Sub-agents will be able to request tools from the `ToolDispatcher` and use them to perform their tasks.
    *   This will allow for a more modular and extensible system, where new tools can be added without modifying the sub-agents themselves.

## Phase 3: Integration and Testing

1.  **WebSocket Integration:**
    *   Ensure that the `Supervisor` and sub-agents provide detailed updates on their status and progress via WebSockets.
    *   The frontend will use these updates to provide a real-time view of the agent's progress to the user.

2.  **Testing:**
    *   Create a new test file `integration_tests/test_agent_flow.py` to test the end-to-end flow of the agent system.
    *   The test will simulate a user request and verify that the agents run in the correct order and that the final result is correct.
    *   The test will also verify that the WebSocket updates are sent correctly.

## Phase 4: Documentation

1.  **Documentation:**
    *   Create a new documentation file `docs/subagents.md` to describe the new sub-agent architecture.
    *   The document will explain the role of each sub-agent and how they interact with each other.
    *   It will also provide instructions on how to create new sub-agents and tools.
