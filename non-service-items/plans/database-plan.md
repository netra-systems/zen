# Plan for Database Specification

This plan outlines the steps to ensure the database is a complete end-to-end system, as defined in `SPEC/database.txt`.

## 1. Verify Database Separation

- **Action**: Ensure that the production, development, and testing databases are separate.
- **Verification**: Check the configuration files (e.g., `app/config.py`) to confirm that there are distinct database configurations for each environment.

## 2. Schema Verification

- **Action**: Verify that the database schema is defined in `app/db/models` and versioned using Alembic.
- **Verification**:
    - List the contents of `app/db/models` to see the defined models.
    - Check the `app/alembic` directory and `alembic.ini` to confirm Alembic is set up correctly.
    - Review the migration scripts in `app/alembic/versions`.

## 3. Model Verification

- **Action**: Ensure that the models are defined using SQLAlchemy and validated with Pydantic.
- **Verification**:
    - Inspect the model files in `app/db/models` to confirm they use SQLAlchemy.
    - Check the corresponding Pydantic schemas in `app/schemas` and verify that they are used for validation.

## 4. Test Seeding Verification

- **Action**: Verify that the test database is seeded with initial data and that the seeding scripts are idempotent.
- **Verification**:
    - Look for test data seeding scripts, possibly in `app/tests/` or `app/testing_data`.
    - Review the scripts to ensure they can be run multiple times without causing errors.

## 5. End-to-End System Coherence

- **Action**: Ensure the database system works in harmony with the application.
- **Verification**:
    - Run the application's tests to ensure all database interactions are working correctly.
    - Manually test the application's database-related features if necessary.
