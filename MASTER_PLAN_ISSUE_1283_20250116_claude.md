#### Action Items:
1. **System Health Validation**
   ```bash
   # Verify current system status
   python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py

   ```

2. **Infrastructure Verification**
   ```bash
   # Test staging environment connectivity
   curl -f https://staging.netrasystems.ai/health
   # Verify WebSocket connectivity
   python tests/e2e/test_websocket_dev_docker_connection.py
   ```

3. **Golden Path Validation**
   ```bash
   # Ensure primary business value works

#### If Issues Remain (Unexpected):

Create focused sub-issues (see Phase 3)

### Phase 3: Contingency - New Issue Structure (if needed)

**Only if specific, current problems are discovered**

#### Sub-Issue Template:

**Issue Title Format**: `[Staging] Specific Problem - Focus Area`

**Required Elements**:
- **Problem Statement**: Exact error or failure mode
- **Current State**: What specifically doesn't work
- **Expected State**: What should work
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable success conditions
- **Business Impact**: Effect on Golden Path
- **Dependencies**: Links to resolved infrastructure work

#### Example Sub-Issues (if needed):

1. **SSL Certificate Renewal Process**
   - Scope: Automated certificate management
   - Impact: Prevents future SSL failures
   - Priority: P2 (operational)

2. **WebSocket Monitoring Enhancement**
   - Scope: Real-time connection health
   - Impact: Early detection of connectivity issues
   - Priority: P3 (observability)
