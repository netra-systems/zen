## Summary
- Fixed SessionMiddleware log spam with rate limiting implementation
- Enhanced startup orchestrator graceful degradation flow
- Resolves P1 log noise pollution affecting $500K+ ARR monitoring

## Changes Made
- **Rate Limiting**: Added rate limiter to suppress excessive session access warnings
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fixed startup sequence to continue properly in emergency bypass mode
- **System Stability**: Maintained all existing functionality while reducing log spam

## Technical Details
- Modified `netra_backend/app/middleware/gcp_auth_context_middleware.py` with rate limiting
- Fixed `netra_backend/app/smd.py` startup orchestrator flow
- Target: Reduce 100+ warnings/hour to <12 warnings/hour

## Test Plan
- [x] Unit tests for log spam reproduction and prevention
- [x] Integration tests for rate limiting functionality
- [x] System stability validation completed
- [x] Import compatibility verified

## Business Impact
- **P1 Resolution**: Log noise pollution resolved for production monitoring
- **Operational Improvement**: Enhanced visibility without alert fatigue
- **Service Reliability**: Graceful degradation maintains availability

Closes #169
