## Clustered Log Analysis for Issue Processing

### ðŸ”´ CLUSTER 1: WebSocket Import Dependency Failure - Complete Service Failure (P0 CRITICAL)
**Issue Count:** 25 ERROR entries (8.3% of all logs)
**Severity:** Critical - Complete service unavailability
**Business Impact:** Total platform functionality failure

#### Key Log Patterns:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "ImportError",
    "value": "CRITICAL: Core WebSocket components import failed: No module named 'auth_service'. This indicates a dependency issue that must be resolved."
  },
  "location": "netra_backend.app.core.middleware_setup.py lines 799, 852"
}
```

#### Technical Details:
- **Import Failure:** `from netra_backend.app.middleware.uvicorn_protocol_enh` fails
- **Missing Module:** 'auth_service' module not found during WebSocket middleware setup
- **Container Behavior:** Container called exit(3) - 34 occurrences in 1 hour
- **Middleware Setup:** Enhanced middleware setup completely failing

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Dependency Issue:** auth_service module not available in backend container
2. **Build/Deployment Problem:** Missing dependency during container build
3. **Import Path Issue:** Incorrect import path or missing package installation
4. **Container Configuration:** Possible missing service dependencies

#### Recommended Actions:
- [ ] **IMMEDIATE:** Check container build process for auth_service dependencies
- [ ] **IMMEDIATE:** Verify import paths in WebSocket middleware setup
- [ ] **IMMEDIATE:** Validate container has all required Python packages installed
- [ ] **URGENT:** Fix import dependency and redeploy immediately

### ðŸ”´ CLUSTER 2: Auth Database Connection Timeout - Complete Auth Failure (P0 CRITICAL)
**Issue Count:** 12 ERROR entries (4% of all logs)
**Severity:** Critical - Authentication system unavailable
**Business Impact:** Complete authentication failure

#### Key Log Patterns:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "FAIL: AUTH DATABASE: Connection FAILED - Auth database initialization failed: Database connection validation timeout exceeded (15s). This may indicate network connectivity issues or database overload"
  },
  "location": "auth_service.auth_core.database.connection.py lines 67, 72, 126"
}
```

#### Technical Details:
- **Timeout Location:** asyncio.wait_for() timeout in auth database connection
- **Connection Validation:** 15s timeout exceeded during database initialization
- **Service Failure:** Auth service cannot start due to database connectivity
- **Container Restart:** Multiple auth service container restarts

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Database Connectivity:** Auth database unreachable from Cloud Run
2. **Network Issues:** VPC connector or networking problems
3. **Database Overload:** Possible database performance issues
4. **Timeout Configuration:** 15s timeout may be insufficient for cold starts

#### Recommended Actions:
- [ ] **IMMEDIATE:** Check auth database instance status and accessibility
- [ ] **IMMEDIATE:** Verify VPC connector configuration for auth database
- [ ] **URGENT:** Test database connectivity from Cloud Run environment
- [ ] **URGENT:** Increase auth database connection timeout

### ðŸ”´ CLUSTER 3: Complete API Failure - All Endpoints Down (P1 HIGH)
**Issue Count:** 40+ HTTP 500/503 errors
**Severity:** High - Complete API unavailability
**Business Impact:** All user-facing functionality offline

#### Key HTTP Error Patterns:
```
API Endpoints Failing (HTTP 500/503):
- /health (health checks)
- /api/conversations/*
- /api/threads/*
- /api/chat/*
- /api/messages/*
- /api/sessions/*
- /api/execute/tool
- /api/tools/list
```

#### Technical Details:
- **Health Checks:** Multiple 503 errors on /health endpoint
- **Chat APIs:** All chat-related endpoints returning 500 errors
- **Tool Execution:** Tool execution endpoints failing
- **Session Management:** Session APIs completely down

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Upstream Dependency:** Backend service failure cascading to all APIs
2. **WebSocket Issues:** Middleware setup failure affecting all requests
3. **Database Issues:** Auth failures preventing API initialization
4. **Container Issues:** Service restarts causing API unavailability

#### Recommended Actions:
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY:** Resolve WebSocket dependency issues (root cause)
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY:** Fix auth database connectivity
- [ ] **URGENT:** Monitor API recovery after dependency fixes

---

### ðŸŸ¡ CLUSTER 4: Container Instance Failure - Infrastructure Issues (P2 WARNING)
**Issue Count:** 43 "instance could not start" + 34 "exit(3)" entries
**Severity:** Warning - Infrastructure stability
**Business Impact:** Service reliability and startup performance

#### Key Log Patterns:
```
"The request failed because the instance could not start successfully." (43 occurrences)
"Container called exit(3)." (34 occurrences)
```

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Startup Failures:** Container cannot complete initialization
2. **Exit Code 3:** Application error causing container termination
3. **Restart Loops:** Cloud Run continuously attempting to restart failed containers
4. **Resource Issues:** Possible resource constraints or configuration problems

#### Recommended Actions:
- [ ] Check Cloud Run resource allocation and limits
- [ ] Review container startup scripts and dependencies
- [ ] Monitor container logs for detailed startup failure reasons

---

### ðŸŸ¡ CLUSTER 5: Configuration and Monitoring Issues (P3 WARNING)
**Issue Count:** 65 WARNING entries
**Severity:** Warning - Operational quality
**Business Impact:** Development and monitoring capabilities

#### Key Log Patterns:
```
"Sentry SDK not available - install sentry-sdk[fastapi] to enable error tracking" (33 occurrences)
"SERVICE_ID contained whitespace - sanitized from 'netra-backend\n' to 'netra-backend'" (32 occurrences)
```

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Missing Monitoring:** Sentry SDK not installed for error tracking
2. **Configuration Quality:** SERVICE_ID contains trailing whitespace
3. **Data Sanitization:** Automatic cleanup indicates configuration issues

#### Recommended Actions:
- [ ] Install and configure Sentry SDK for error tracking
- [ ] Fix SERVICE_ID environment variable formatting
- [ ] Audit other environment variables for similar issues
