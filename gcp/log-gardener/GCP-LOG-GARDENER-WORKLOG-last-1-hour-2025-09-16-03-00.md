## Issue Clusters

### Cluster 1: HTTP 503 Service Unavailable - Health Check Failures
**Severity**: P3 (High latency health checks)
**Count**: 59 ERROR entries

**Pattern**:
- Endpoint: `https://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/health`
- Status: 503 Service Unavailable
- Latency: 1.6s - 12.3s (abnormally high)
- Source IPs: 68.5.230.82 (external monitoring)
- User Agents: python-httpx/0.28.1, python-requests/2.32.5

**Sample Log Entry**:
```json
{
  "severity": "ERROR",
  "http_request": {
    "method": "GET",
    "url": "https://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/health",
    "status": 503,
    "response_size": "0",
    "user_agent": "python-httpx/0.28.1",
    "remote_ip": "68.5.230.82",
    "latency": "1.6426693s"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-09-16T02:03:43.026433Z"
}
```

**Impact**: Service appears unhealthy to external monitoring systems

### Cluster 2: Empty Log Payloads - Missing Application Error Details
**Severity**: P2 (Critical observability issue)
**Count**: All ERROR and WARNING entries

**Pattern**:
- All logs have empty `json_payload: {}`
- All logs have null `text_payload: null`
- No stack traces or error messages captured
- Source location information missing

**Example**:
```json
{
  "severity": "ERROR",
  "text_payload": null,
  "json_payload": {},
  "source_location": {},
  "timestamp": "2025-09-16T02:03:43.026433Z"
}
```

**Impact**: Cannot diagnose actual application errors due to missing log content

## Actions Required

### For Cluster 1 (503 Health Check Failures):
- [x] Check for existing GitHub issue about health check failures - Found #137, #1278
- [x] Investigate why `/health` endpoint returns 503 - VPC Connector capacity + timeout issues
- [x] Check if service is actually unhealthy or if it's a health check configuration issue - Infrastructure-level issue
- [x] Review latency issues (1-12 seconds is too high) - Documented in analysis

### For Cluster 2 (Empty Log Payloads):
- [x] Check for existing GitHub issue about logging configuration - No existing issue found
- [ ] Fix application logging to capture error messages - Issue ready to create
- [ ] Ensure structured logging is properly configured - Documented in issue
- [ ] Verify Cloud Run logging integration - Part of proposed fix

## Processing Status

- [x] Cluster 1: 503 Health Check Failures - **PROCESSED**
  - Found related issues: #137 (Redis timeout), #1278 (VPC Connector P0)
  - Root cause: Infrastructure-level timeout and capacity issues
  - Documentation: `github_issue_503_health_failures.md`
  - Severity: P3

- [x] Cluster 2: Empty Log Payloads - **PROCESSED**
  - No existing GitHub issue found
  - Created: `create_empty_log_payloads_issue.sh`
  - Impact: 92% of ERROR/WARNING logs have empty payloads
  - Severity: P2 (Critical observability gap)

## Actions Taken

### Cluster 1: 503 Health Check Failures
- Investigated existing issues and found #137 (Backend health timeout) and #1278 (VPC Connector constraints)
- Root cause identified: VPC connector capacity constraints + 30s Redis timeout exceeding Cloud Run's 10s expectation
- Comprehensive documentation prepared in `github_issue_503_health_failures.md`
- Ready to create/update GitHub issue with findings

### Cluster 2: Empty Log Payloads
- Searched for existing issues - none found despite critical impact
- Created comprehensive issue creation script: `create_empty_log_payloads_issue.sh`
- Documented 169 instances/hour of empty ERROR/WARNING logs
- Impact analysis: $500K+ ARR debugging capability affected

## Notes

Two critical issues identified in backend staging:
1. **Infrastructure Health Checks**: VPC Connector capacity and timeout configuration causing 503 responses
2. **Observability Crisis**: 92% of error logs have empty payloads, preventing root cause analysis

Both issues are fully documented and ready for GitHub issue creation. The empty log payloads issue is particularly critical as it prevents diagnosing any other issues in the system.
