## GCP Log Gardener Update - HTTP 503 Health Check Failures

### Latest Log Analysis (2025-09-16T02:00-03:00 UTC)

**Volume**: 59 ERROR entries in the last hour
**Pattern**: Consistent 503 responses on /health endpoint
**Latency**: 1.6s - 12.3s (abnormally high)
**Source**: External monitoring (68.5.230.82)

### Root Cause Confirmation
The logs confirm the VPC Connector capacity constraints and timeout issues:
- Redis validation timeout (30s) exceeding Cloud Run health check expectation (~10s)
- Sequential service validation causing cumulative delays
- Infrastructure-level issue requiring immediate attention

### Impact
- Complete staging environment failure (0% availability)
- All health checks failing with 503 responses
- Service marked as unhealthy by load balancer
- Container restart loops

### Related Issues
- Issue #137: Backend health/ready timeout (Redis timeout fix)
- This issue (#1278): VPC Connector capacity constraints

### Recommendation
Prioritize infrastructure fixes:
1. Scale VPC Connector capacity
2. Optimize health check timeouts
3. Implement parallel service validation
