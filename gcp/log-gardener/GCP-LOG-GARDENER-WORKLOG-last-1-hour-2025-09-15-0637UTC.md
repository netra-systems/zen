# GCP Log Gardener Worklog - Last 1 Hour - 2025-09-15 06:37 UTC

**Focus Area:** Last 1 hour
**Service:** backend (netra-backend-staging)
**Time Range:** 2025-09-15T05:37:00Z to 2025-09-15T06:37:00Z
**Log Collection Time:** 2025-09-15T06:37:17Z
**Timezone:** UTC

## Executive Summary

Found 2 main categories of issues in the backend service logs over the last hour:

1. **High Volume SessionMiddleware Warnings** - Repeated warnings about SessionMiddleware not being installed (100+ occurrences)
2. **WebSocket Race Condition Errors** - Critical startup race conditions causing WebSocket initialization delays

## Log Clusters

### Cluster 1: SessionMiddleware Configuration Issue (P6 - Low Priority)

**Pattern:** Repeated warnings about SessionMiddleware not being installed
**Frequency:** 100+ occurrences in 1 hour (approximately every 20-30 seconds)
**Severity:** WARNING

**Sample Log Entry:**
```json
{
  "jsonPayload": {
    "labels": {
      "function": "callHandlers",
      "line": "1706",
      "module": "logging"
    },
    "message": "Session access failed (middleware not installed?): SessionMiddleware must be installed to access request.session",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-15T06:37:02.925467+00:00"
  },
  "severity": "WARNING"
}
```

**Impact:**
- No functional impact on core services
- Creates log noise
- May indicate configuration drift or missing middleware

### Cluster 2: WebSocket Race Condition During Startup (P3 - Medium Priority)

**Pattern:** Race conditions during WebSocket initialization preventing timely startup
**Frequency:** 2 occurrences in 1 hour
**Severity:** ERROR

**Sample Log Entry:**
```json
{
  "jsonPayload": {
    "context": {
      "name": "netra_backend.app.websocket_core.gcp_initialization_validator",
      "service": "netra-service"
    },
    "labels": {
      "function": "validate_gcp_readiness_for_websocket",
      "line": "1245",
      "module": "netra_backend.app.websocket_core.gcp_initialization_validator"
    },
    "message": "? RACE CONDITION DETECTED: Startup phase 'no_app_state' did not reach 'services' within 2.8s - WebSocket connections will be queued to prevent 1011 errors",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-15T05:48:29.306485+00:00"
  },
  "severity": "ERROR"
}
```

**Key Details:**
- Location: `netra_backend.app.websocket_core.gcp_initialization_validator:1245`
- Function: `validate_gcp_readiness_for_websocket`
- Timeout: 2.8 seconds for startup phase transition
- Mitigation: WebSocket connections are queued to prevent 1011 errors

**Impact:**
- Potential delays in WebSocket connection establishment
- May affect real-time chat functionality during startup
- Could impact user experience during service restarts
