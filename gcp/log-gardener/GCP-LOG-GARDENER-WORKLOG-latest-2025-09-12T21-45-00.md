**Project:** netra-staging  
**Services Analyzed:** backend-staging, netra-backend-staging  
**Analysis Period:** Last 24 hours  

## Executive Summary
Critical JWT configuration issue blocking staging environment functionality. Multiple authentication-related errors and service startup failures detected. All issues processed and tracked in GitHub.

## Discovered Issues

### Issue 1: JWT Secret Configuration Missing - CRITICAL
**Severity:** P0 (Critical - blocking $50K MRR WebSocket functionality)  
**Service:** backend-staging  
**First Occurrence:** 2025-09-12T13:00:09Z  
**Latest Occurrence:** 2025-09-12T16:55:17Z  
**Frequency:** Continuous (multiple instances)  

**Error Details:**
```
ValueError: JWT secret not configured: JWT secret not configured for staging environment. 
Please set JWT_SECRET_STAGING or JWT_SECRET_KEY. This is blocking $50K MRR WebSocket functionality.
```

**Stack Trace Location:**
- `/app/netra_backend/app/middleware/fastapi_auth_middleware.py:696`
- `/app/netra_backend/app/core/configuration/unified_secrets.py:117`
- `/app/shared/jwt_secret_manager.py:164`

**Business Impact:** 
- Complete service initialization failure
- WebSocket functionality blocked
- $50K MRR at risk

### Issue 2: Authentication Errors - HIGH
**Severity:** P1 (High - service authentication failing)  
**Service:** backend-staging  
**Occurrences:** Multiple instances  

**Error Details:**
```
WARNING: The request was not authorized to invoke this service.
WARNING: The request was not authenticated. Either allow unauthenticated invocations or set the proper Authorization header.
```

**Business Impact:**
- API requests failing due to authentication issues
- Service accessibility problems
- Likely symptom of JWT configuration issue

### Issue 3: Critical Service Failures - CRITICAL  
**Severity:** P0 (Critical - service startup failures)  
**Service:** netra-backend-staging  
**Latest Occurrences:** 2025-09-12T20:16:50Z, 2025-09-12T20:16:19Z, 2025-09-12T20:15:49Z  

**Pattern:** Multiple CRITICAL level logs without detailed error messages, indicating potential:
- Service startup sequence failures
- Resource allocation issues
- Configuration validation failures

**Business Impact:**
- Service instability
- Potential user experience degradation

### Issue 4: Widespread Warning Pattern - MEDIUM
**Severity:** P2 (Medium - operational warnings)  
**Service:** netra-backend-staging  
**Pattern:** Continuous stream of WARNING level logs  
**Latest Window:** 2025-09-12T20:16:00Z - 2025-09-12T20:16:53Z  

**Business Impact:**
- Potential performance degradation
