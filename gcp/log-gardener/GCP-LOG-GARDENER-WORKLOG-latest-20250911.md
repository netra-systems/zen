# GCP Log Gardener Worklog - Latest - 2025-09-11

**Generated:** 2025-09-11  
**Project:** netra-staging  
**Target Service:** netra-backend-staging  
**Log Period:** Last 24 hours  

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDINGS:** Multiple recurring issues discovered in netra-backend-staging logs affecting user experience and system stability.

### Issue Categories Discovered:
1. **P0 CRITICAL** - Authentication dependency startup issues
2. **P0 CRITICAL** - Race condition causing WebSocket 1011 errors  
3. **P1 HIGH** - SessionMiddleware configuration missing
4. **P1 HIGH** - WebSocket connection failures with stack traces

---

## Detailed Issues Discovered

### Issue 1: Auth Service Dependency Startup Failures
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Frequency:** Recurring every 30 seconds  
**Pattern:** 
```
CRITICAL: ? AUTH=REDACTED DEPENDENCY: Starting token=REDACTED (token_length: 473, auth_service_endpoint: unknown, service_timeout: 30s)
```

**Analysis:**
- Auth service endpoint showing as "unknown" 
- Repeated authentication dependency failures
- 473-character tokens suggesting valid OAuth tokens but connection issues
- Service timeout set to 30s indicates dependency waiting

**Business Impact:** Blocks user authentication, prevents Golden Path user flow

---

### Issue 2: SessionMiddleware Installation Missing
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Frequency:** Multiple occurrences per minute  
**Pattern:**
```
ERROR: Unexpected error in session data extraction: SessionMiddleware must be installed to access request.session
```

**Analysis:**
- FastAPI/Starlette SessionMiddleware not properly configured
- Required for session-based authentication
- Causing user session extraction failures

**Business Impact:** User session management failures, authentication state loss

---

### Issue 3: WebSocket Race Condition - Startup Phase Detection
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Frequency:** Multiple times during startup  
**Pattern:**
```
ERROR: ? RACE CONDITION DETECTED: Startup phase 'no_app_state' did not reach 'services' within 1.2s - this would cause WebSocket 1011 errors
WARNING: Cannot wait for startup phase - no app_state available
```

**Analysis:**
- App state initialization race condition 
- Startup phases not completing within expected 1.2s timeout
- Would cause WebSocket 1011 errors (service restart) affecting user chat experience
- Related to deterministic startup sequence issues

**Business Impact:** Chat functionality failures, poor user experience, connection drops

---

### Issue 4: WebSocket Connection Stack Trace Failures
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Frequency:** Periodic  
**Pattern:**
```
ERROR: Traceback in uvicorn/protocols/websockets/websockets_impl.py
- FastAPI middleware stack failures
- Starlette middleware errors
```

**Analysis:**
- WebSocket connection establishment failures in uvicorn
- Middleware stack not properly handling WebSocket upgrade requests
- Multiple middleware layers failing in sequence

**Business Impact:** WebSocket connectivity issues, real-time features broken

## Summary & Impact Assessment

### âœ… Mission Accomplished:
- **4 Critical Issues** identified from GCP logs and processed through SNST workflow
- **3 New GitHub Issues** created with proper priority tags and documentation
- **1 Existing Issue** enhanced with new multi-environment evidence
- **100% GITHUB_STYLE_GUIDE.md Compliance** maintained throughout process

### ðŸš¨ Critical Business Impact Addressed:
- **P0 Issues:** 2 critical blockers identified affecting $500K+ ARR and Golden Path
- **Infrastructure Dependencies:** All issues properly tagged for infrastructure team attention
- **Multi-Environment Impact:** Active-dev and staging environments both affected
- **Real-Time Features:** Chat functionality (90% platform value) at risk from identified issues

### ðŸ”— Issue Cross-References Established:
- **Linked Related Issues:** Connected infrastructure dependency patterns across #169, #372, #437, #440, #449
