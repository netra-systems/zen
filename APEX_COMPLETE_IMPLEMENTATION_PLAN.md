# TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Module Boundaries (300 Line Limit)
```python
# GOOD: Focused single-responsibility modules
app/gateway/proxy_core.py         # 250 lines - HTTP proxy logic
app/gateway/interceptor.py        # 200 lines - Request interception
app/gateway/router.py              # 150 lines - Routing decisions

# BAD: Monolithic modules
app/gateway.py                     # 1000+ lines - VIOLATION
```

### 2. Function Design (8 Line Limit)
```python
# GOOD: Composable 8-line functions
def optimize_prompt(prompt: str) -> str:
    tokens = tokenize(prompt)
    compressed = compress_tokens(tokens)
    validated = validate_compression(compressed)
    cached = check_cache(validated)
    if cached:
        return cached
    result = apply_compression(validated)
    return cache_result(result)

# BAD: Monolithic functions
def optimize_prompt(prompt: str) -> str:
    # 50+ lines of logic - VIOLATION
```

### 3. Type Safety (Pydantic Models)
```python
# All data structures use Pydantic
class OptimizationRequest(BaseModel):
    prompt: str
    model: str
    max_tokens: int
    temperature: float
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
    
class OptimizationResult(BaseModel):
    optimized_prompt: str
    savings_dollars: float
    latency_ms: int
    cache_hit: bool
```

## Gateway Implementation Specification

### Core Proxy Flow
```python
# app/gateway/proxy_core.py
async def handle_request(request: Request) -> Response:
    # 1. Intercept
    parsed = parse_llm_request(request)
    
    # 2. Optimize
    optimized = await optimization_engine.process(parsed)
    
    # 3. Execute
    response = await execute_provider_call(optimized)
    
    # 4. Attribute
    savings = attribution_engine.calculate(parsed, optimized)
    
    # 5. Return
    return format_response(response, savings)
```

### Optimization Pipeline
```python
# app/optimizations/pipeline.py
class OptimizationPipeline:
    stages = [
        SemanticCache(),      # 15-25% savings
        PromptCompressor(),   # 10-15% savings  
        ModelRouter(),        # 20-30% savings
        BatchOptimizer(),     # 5-10% savings
    ]
    
    async def process(self, request: LLMRequest) -> OptimizedRequest:
        for stage in self.stages:
            request = await stage.optimize(request)
        return request
```

## Validation Workbench Specification

### Sandbox Orchestration
```python
# app/validation/sandbox_orchestrator.py
class SandboxOrchestrator:
    async def create_validation_job(
        self,
        customer_id: str,
        terraform_config: str,
        workload: Workload
    ) -> ValidationJob:
        # 1. Provision sandbox
        sandbox = await self.provision_sandbox(customer_id)
        
        # 2. Deploy infrastructure
        deployment = await self.deploy_terraform(sandbox, terraform_config)
        
        # 3. Run workload
        results = await self.replay_workload(deployment, workload)
        
        # 4. Calculate BVM
        bvm_cost = self.calculate_bvm(sandbox.resources_used)
        
        # 5. Generate report
        return self.generate_report(results, bvm_cost)
```

## Database Schema Updates

### Usage Tracking
```sql
CREATE TABLE usage_metrics (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    endpoint VARCHAR(255),
    tokens_used INTEGER,
    cost_saved DECIMAL(10,4),
    tier VARCHAR(50),
    optimization_type VARCHAR(100)

    workload_data JSONB,
    results JSONB,
    bvm_minutes INTEGER,
    bvm_cost DECIMAL(10,2),
    status VARCHAR(50)

# RISK MITIGATION

## Technical Risks & Mitigations

### 1. Latency Impact
**Risk**: Gateway adds unacceptable latency
**Mitigation**: 
- Aggressive caching (Redis)
- Edge deployment (Cloudflare Workers)
- Bypass mode for latency-sensitive requests

### 2. Provider API Changes
**Risk**: OpenAI/Anthropic change APIs
**Mitigation**:
- Abstract provider interfaces
- Version detection
- Automatic fallback to passthrough

### 3. Attribution Disputes
**Risk**: Customers dispute savings calculations
**Mitigation**:
- Detailed audit logs
- A/B test data retention
- Third-party verification option

## Business Risks & Mitigations

### 1. Slow Adoption
**Risk**: Customers hesitant to route through proxy
**Mitigation**:
- Start with read-only analytics (The Wedge)
- Gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100% traffic)
- White-glove onboarding for first 50 customers

### 2. Pricing Resistance
**Risk**: 20% performance fee too high
**Mitigation**:
- Guaranteed minimum 5x ROI
- Option for fixed-fee Enterprise tier
- Free tier to demonstrate value
