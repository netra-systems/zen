## Problem Summary
The unit test `test_agent_death_detection_prevents_silent_failures` is failing, indicating that agent death detection validation is broken.

## Business Impact
This is **P0 Critical** because:
- Affects core business functionality (agent reliability)
- Impacts chat functionality which delivers 90% of platform value
- Can lead to silent failures and hung agent scenarios
- Affects user feedback and business metrics collection

## Test Location
- **File**: `netra_backend/tests/unit/agents/supervisor/test_agent_execution_core_business_logic_comprehensive.py`
- **Test**: `test_agent_death_detection_prevents_silent_failures`

## Current Status
- Test is currently failing when running unit tests
- Issue is documented in internal worklog files as P0 Critical
- Agent death detection implementation exists but validation is broken

## Related Documentation
- Documented in `/reports/test_failures_list.md`
- Comprehensive implementation details in `SPEC/learnings/agent_death_detection_critical.xml`
- Tracked in `FAILING-TEST-GARDENER-WORKLOG-agents-20250914_0619.md`

## Expected Behavior
Agent death detection should properly validate and prevent silent failures

## Actual Behavior
Unit test is failing, indicating validation is not working correctly

## Priority Justification
**Business Impact**: Chat functionality delivers 90% of platform value. Agent reliability is core to delivering substantive AI responses to users.

**System Impact**: Silent failures in agent execution can lead to:
- Poor user experience with hung agents
- Loss of business metrics and feedback
- Degraded system reliability
- Customer churn due to unreliable AI responses
