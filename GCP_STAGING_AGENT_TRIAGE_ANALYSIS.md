# GCP Staging Agent Triage Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
**Critical Issue**: Agent requests are being received but not executing properly in GCP staging environment.

## Key Findings

### 1. WebSocket Manager Not Being Set (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: `WebSocket manager set to None for 8/8 agents` appears repeatedly in logs
- **Impact**: Agents cannot send real-time updates to clients
- **Location**: `netra_backend.app.agents.supervisor.agent_registry:set_websocket_manager:266`

### 2. Agent Request Flow Breakdown
The request flow stops after initial handling:
```
14:28:24 - start_agent message received
14:28:24 - MessageRouter processes START_AGENT
14:28:24 - AgentRequestHandler handles message  
14:28:24 - Response sent immediately (turn unknown)
14:28:24 - NO ACTUAL AGENT EXECUTION FOLLOWS
```

### 3. Service Dependency Issues

#### Auth Service Failures
- Continuous errors: `Auth service is required for token validation - no fallback available`
- Occurring every 1-2 minutes suggesting health check failures
- Impact: May prevent proper user context initialization

#### ClickHouse Connection Missing  
- Multiple health check failures for ClickHouse
- Error: `ClickHouse connection required in development mode`
- May affect data persistence and analytics

### 4. WebSocket Infrastructure Problems

#### Heartbeat Timeouts
- Warning: `WebSocket heartbeat timeout` at 14:30:17
- Indicates potential connection stability issues

#### Cleanup Errors
- Error: `'WebSocketManager' object has no attribute 'disconnect_user'`
- Suggests incomplete WebSocketManager implementation

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: WebSocket Manager Not Initialized
The core problem is that the WebSocketManager is being set to `None` during agent registration, which prevents:
1. Agent execution notifications (`agent_started`, `agent_thinking`)
2. Tool execution updates (`tool_executing`, `tool_completed`)  
3. Result delivery (`agent_completed`)

### Why Messages Get Stuck at Triage
1. Triage agent initializes correctly with model configuration
2. But without WebSocketManager, it cannot send updates
3. The system likely short-circuits to avoid null pointer exceptions
4. Returns immediately without executing the agent pipeline

## Critical Code Points to Check

1. **Agent Registry Initialization**
   - File: `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/agent_registry.py:266`
   - Issue: WebSocketManager being set to None

2. **WebSocket Handler Integration**
   - File: `netra_backend/app/websocket_core/handlers.py`
   - Check: AgentRequestHandler initialization and supervisor integration

3. **Supervisor Execution Engine**
   - Verify ExecutionEngine has WebSocketNotifier
   - Check EnhancedToolExecutionEngine wrapping

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix WebSocketManager Initialization
```python
# In agent_registry.py
def set_websocket_manager(self, websocket_manager):
    # MUST NOT be None in production
    if websocket_manager is None:
        logger.error("WebSocketManager is None - agents will not send updates!")
    self.websocket_manager = websocket_manager
    # Ensure all agents get the manager
```

### 2. Verify Startup Sequence
The correct initialization order should be:
1. Initialize WebSocketManager
2. Initialize Supervisor/ThreadService  
3. Register agents with registry
4. **Set WebSocketManager on registry** (THIS IS MISSING)
5. Start WebSocket endpoint

### 3. Add Diagnostic Logging
Add logging to track:
- When WebSocketManager is created
- When it's passed to agent registry
- When agents attempt to send notifications
- Any exceptions during agent execution

## Environment Configuration Issues

### Auth Service Configuration
- Auth service URL may be misconfigured
- Check environment variables for AUTH_SERVICE_URL
- Verify auth service is deployed and healthy

### ClickHouse Configuration  
- ClickHouse appears to be required but not available
- Either provision ClickHouse or disable requirement in staging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify WebSocket Event Flow**
   ```bash
   python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py
   ```

2. **Check Agent Registration**
   ```bash
   python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category integration --filter agent_registry
   ```

3. **Monitor Real-time Logs**
   ```bash
   gcloud logging tail --resource-type=cloud_run_revision \
     --format="value(timestamp,jsonPayload.message)" \
     "resource.labels.service_name=netra-backend-staging"
   ```

## Success Criteria
A successful agent execution should show:
1. `WebSocket manager set to <WebSocketManager instance>` (not None)
2. `agent_started` event sent
3. `agent_thinking` events during processing
4. `tool_executing` for each tool use
5. `agent_completed` with results

## Timeline
- **14:28:17** - WebSocket connection established successfully
- **14:28:24** - Agent request received and acknowledged
- **14:28:24** - Processing stops (no further agent activity)
- **14:30:17** - WebSocket heartbeat timeout (connection degraded)

## Conclusion
The staging environment has a critical initialization issue where the WebSocketManager is not being properly set on the agent registry. This prevents all agent execution and real-time updates. The fix requires ensuring the WebSocketManager is properly initialized and passed to the agent registry during application startup.
