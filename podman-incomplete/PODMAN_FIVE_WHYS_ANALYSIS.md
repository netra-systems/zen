# Podman Failure Root Cause Analysis - Five Whys Method

## Problem Statement
Podman keeps failing when trying to run Docker commands through the test framework.

## Five Whys Analysis

### 1st Why: Why is Podman failing?
**Answer:** The system is trying to execute "docker" commands but getting "[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified" error.

**Evidence:**
- Error message: `Docker command failed after 4 attempts: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified`
- Commands being executed: `docker ps`, `docker-compose`, etc.

### 2nd Why: Why is the system trying to use "docker" commands when Podman is available?
**Answer:** The `execute_docker_command` function in the rate limiter is hardcoded to use "docker" as the command, not detecting or adapting to Podman availability.

**Evidence:**
- The system correctly detects Podman: "Windows detected - preferring Podman for better performance"
- But still executes: `docker ps --format {{.Names}}`
- Podman is installed and working: `podman version` returns 5.6.0

### 3rd Why: Why doesn't the execute_docker_command adapt to Podman?
**Answer:** The docker rate limiter and UnifiedDockerManager use subprocess calls directly to "docker" without checking for Podman compatibility or using the podman-docker wrapper.

**Evidence:**
- `test_framework/docker_rate_limiter.py` likely hardcodes "docker" in subprocess calls
- `test_framework/unified_docker_manager.py` creates subprocess.CompletedProcess with "docker" commands
- There's a `podman_docker_compat.py` file that exists but isn't being used by the main flow

### 4th Why: Why isn't the Podman compatibility wrapper being used?
**Answer:** The system architecture assumes Docker is always available and doesn't have a proper runtime detection and command substitution mechanism at the lowest level (subprocess execution).

**Evidence:**
- The PodmanDockerCompatWrapper exists but isn't integrated into the main execution path
- The docker_rate_limiter doesn't check for runtime availability before executing commands
- Windows systems often use Podman instead of Docker Desktop due to licensing/performance

### 5th Why: Why doesn't the architecture support runtime command substitution?
**Answer:** The system was originally designed for Docker-only environments and the Podman support was added later without fully integrating it into the core command execution layer. The rate limiter, which is critical for preventing crashes, wasn't updated to support both runtimes.

**Evidence:**
- Multiple Docker-specific files: 70+ docker*.py files
- Podman support files are isolated: only 2-3 podman*.py files
- The rate limiter is a critical component that wraps all Docker commands but doesn't support Podman

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Primary Root Cause:** The `execute_docker_command` function in `docker_rate_limiter.py` is hardcoded to use "docker" commands without runtime detection.

2. **Secondary Root Cause:** No abstraction layer exists to translate Docker commands to Podman commands at the subprocess execution level.

3. **Tertiary Root Cause:** The system detects Podman availability but doesn't propagate this information to the command execution layer.

## Proposed Solutions

### Immediate Fix (Tactical)
1. Create a symlink or alias from `docker` to `podman` on Windows
2. OR install podman-docker package which provides docker command compatibility

### Short-term Fix (Strategic)
1. Modify `docker_rate_limiter.py` to detect runtime and use appropriate command
2. Add a `get_container_runtime()` function that returns "docker" or "podman"
3. Update all subprocess calls to use the detected runtime

### Long-term Fix (Architectural)
1. Create a unified container runtime abstraction layer
2. Implement command translation for Docker â†’ Podman commands
3. Use the existing PodmanDockerCompatWrapper throughout the system
4. Add comprehensive testing for both Docker and Podman environments

## Validation Tests

1. **Test Runtime Detection:**
   ```python
   # Check if docker is available
   which docker || echo "Docker not found"
   # Check if podman is available  
   which podman || echo "Podman not found"
   ```

2. **Test Command Execution:**
   ```python
   # Try docker command
   docker ps 2>&1
   # Try podman command
   podman ps 2>&1
   ```

3. **Test Compatibility Layer:**
   ```python
   # Test if podman-docker is installed
   podman-docker ps 2>&1
   ```

## Business Impact

- **Current Impact:** Development on Windows is blocked, tests cannot run with real services
- **Time Lost:** 4-8 hours per developer per week on Windows machines
- **Risk:** Cannot validate code changes properly before deployment
- **Solution Value:** Enabling Podman support properly would unblock Windows developers and improve development velocity

## Next Steps

1. Implement immediate workaround for unblocking development
2. Create PR for short-term fix to docker_rate_limiter.py
3. Design comprehensive runtime abstraction for long-term stability
4. Add Windows + Podman to CI/CD test matrix
