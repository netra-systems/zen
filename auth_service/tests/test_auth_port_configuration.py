Tests for Auth Service Port Configuration Mismatch Issue

This test suite exposes the critical port configuration mismatch where:
- Auth service binds to port 8081 (from AUTH_PORT env var) 
- But internally configures its URL as http://127.0.0.1:8001
- This mismatch prevents startup completion and causes connection failures

Root Cause: Dual configuration sources without validation
- Port binding uses AUTH_PORT correctly  
- URL configuration hardcoded or incorrectly derived

These tests MUST fail initially to demonstrate the issue before fixes are applied.
