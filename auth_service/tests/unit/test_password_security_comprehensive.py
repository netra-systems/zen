Password Security Comprehensive Tests - PRIORITY 2 SECURITY CRITICAL

**CRITICAL**: Comprehensive password policy enforcement testing with security validation.
These tests ensure password security protects Chat user accounts from credential attacks,
preventing unauthorized access to AI conversations and user data.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All tiers - password security affects all user registrations  
- Business Goal: Security, User Protection, Compliance
- Value Impact: Prevents account breaches that could compromise Chat conversations
- Strategic Impact: Password security maintains platform trust and prevents data breaches

ULTRA CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Tests designed to FAIL HARD - no try/except bypassing
- Focus on realistic password attack scenarios
- Password policies must prevent common attack vectors
- ABSOLUTE IMPORTS ONLY (from auth_service.* not relative)

Password Attack Vectors Tested:
- Brute force password attempts
- Dictionary attack patterns
- Password cracking with common patterns  
- Sequential character attacks
- Password reuse and history validation
- Credential stuffing prevention
