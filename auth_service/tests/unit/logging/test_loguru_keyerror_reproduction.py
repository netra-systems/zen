"""
Test Suite for Validating KeyError: 'timestamp' Fix in Auth Service Logging

CRITICAL ISSUE VALIDATION:
This test suite validates that the KeyError: 'timestamp' fix (commit 6926d6ae3) works correctly
in auth service logging. The issue has been FIXED and these tests confirm the solution.

ISSUE BACKGROUND:
The original issue occurred when JSON formatter output was incorrectly passed to Loguru's
logger.add() format= parameter, causing Loguru to interpret "timestamp" as a format field.

FIX IMPLEMENTED:
The fix replaced the problematic format= parameter with a custom json_sink() function that
handles JSON formatting directly, preventing format string parsing errors.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: All tests in this suite should PASS to validate the fix works correctly.

TEST APPROACH:
- Validate that JSON logging works without KeyError in all scenarios
- Test auth service specific logging contexts
- Ensure the fix maintains all original functionality
- Confirm no regression in logging behavior
