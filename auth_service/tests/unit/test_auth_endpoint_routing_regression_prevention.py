"""
Unit tests to prevent auth endpoint routing regressions

Tests that verify all critical auth endpoints exist and are properly routed.
Prevents 404 regressions when backend calls auth service endpoints.

Based on regression analysis of commits:
- c0a9fa551: fix(auth): implement missing auth endpoints to resolve 404 errors  
- e56acbc9a: fix(auth): implement missing /auth/dev/login endpoint

Root cause: Auth endpoints were missing or not properly registered in router,
causing 404 errors when backend attempted to call auth service.
