Test Suite for Issue #487: Institutional Domain Classification Enhancement

This test suite validates the enhancement to support institutional domain classification
for business intelligence and partnership opportunities, specifically addressing
Cornell University and other educational institution patterns.

Business Value:
- Enables academic partnership identification
- Supports institutional tier assignment logic
- Provides business intelligence for educational market expansion
