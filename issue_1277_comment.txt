## ✅ Issue #1277 Resolution Complete

### Summary
The E2E test collection infrastructure issue has been fully resolved. The project root detection mechanism has been successfully fixed and comprehensively tested.

### Implementation Details
- **Core Fix**: Updated `_detect_project_root()` in `tests/e2e/real_services_manager.py` (lines 519-546)
- **Standards Compliance**: Now uses `pyproject.toml` (PEP 518) instead of project-specific files
- **Robust Detection**: Requires both `pyproject.toml` AND service directories (`netra_backend` or `auth_service`)
- **Multiple Fallbacks**: Directory walking, direct path resolution, and CWD fallback mechanisms

### Test Coverage Added
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: `tests/unit/project_root_detection/test_realservicesmanager_project_root_detection_1277.py` (411 lines)
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/e2e_infrastructure/test_e2e_test_collection_validation_1277.py` (501 lines)
- ✅ **Staging Tests**: `tests/e2e/staging/test_staging_e2e_infrastructure_validation_1277.py`

### Business Value Delivered
- **Restored E2E test collection** - No more '0 tests collected' failures
- **Improved reliability** - Uses Python packaging standards
- **Future-proof** - No dependency on project-specific documentation files
- **Development velocity** - Unblocks CI/CD pipeline

### Verification
All implementations have been verified working. Test files executed successfully with proper project root detection.

Closing as complete.
