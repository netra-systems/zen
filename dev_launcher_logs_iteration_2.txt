DEV LAUNCHER - ITERATION 2 LOGS
======================================
Timestamp: 2025-08-26 14:13:21 - 14:17:08
Status: PARTIAL SUCCESS - Backend and Auth Started, Frontend Failed
Duration: ~4 minutes (2 attempts)

ATTEMPT 1 (14:13:21 - 14:13:57): FAILED - PostgreSQL Down
======================================
INITIAL SETUP - SUCCESS:
✅ Circuit breakers created successfully
✅ Secrets populated for development
✅ ServiceDiscoverySystem initialized
✅ ClickHouse Docker container reused successfully
✅ Environment check passed
✅ Pre-checks completed (3.0s, 93.8% time saved)

SERVICE ISSUES IN ATTEMPT 1:
❌ Redis Docker container failed to start (port 6379 already allocated)
❌ PostgreSQL Connection CRITICAL FAILURE (container was stopped)
❌ Emergency exit - some resources may not be cleaned up properly

ATTEMPT 2 (14:15:08 - 14:17:08): PARTIAL SUCCESS
======================================
INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS:
✅ PostgreSQL: Started and healthy (manually started netra-postgres-dev)
✅ ClickHouse: Running and healthy (netra-clickhouse-dev, Up 23+ hours)  
❌ Redis: Docker start failed (port conflict) but Redis service available elsewhere

DATABASE CONNECTIONS:
✅ PostgreSQL: Connected successfully (after manual container start)
✅ ClickHouse: Connected successfully
✅ Redis: Connected successfully (using existing Redis instance)
✅ Database schema up-to-date with 26 tables

SERVICES STARTED SUCCESSFULLY:
✅ Backend Service:
   - Started on port 8000
   - All startup components initialized (7.04s total)
   - 26 database tables present
   - 7 agents registered (triage, data, optimization, actions, reporting, synthetic_data, corpus_admin)
   - Redis connected for sessions
   - ClickHouse tables initialized
   - System Ready: 10/10 successful, 0 degraded, 0 failed
   - Health endpoint responding at /health/

✅ Auth Service:
   - Started on port 8081
   - Circuit breakers created
   - JWT validation cache initialized with Redis
   - Redis connected for session management
   - OAuth configuration loaded
   - Signal handlers configured for graceful shutdown

PERSISTENT ISSUES:
❌ Backend Health Check: 
   - /health/ready returning 503: "Core database unavailable"
   - PostgreSQL readiness check failing (timeout ~3.2s per request)
   - Backend started but database connection issues persist

❌ Frontend Service:
   - Failed to start (not detailed in logs)
   - Frontend startup appears to have been skipped

❌ WebSocket Validation:
   - WebSocket endpoint validation attempts ongoing
   - Connection attempts to main_ws and mcp_ws failing

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The system can start backend and auth services, but there's a disconnect between:
1. Database connection validation (shows success)
2. Backend readiness checks (shows PostgreSQL unavailable)
This suggests a configuration mismatch or connection pool issue rather than database unavailability.
