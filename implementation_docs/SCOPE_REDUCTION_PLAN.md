# Netra Platform: Scope Reduction & Simplification Plan

## Executive Summary
The Netra platform has grown beyond manageable complexity with **1,155 Python files** in the core application (excluding dependencies), violating its own architectural rules (300-line modules, 8-line functions). Despite the corrected count, the codebase still shows significant bloat with 400 test files, 206 service files, and 126 agent files. This plan identifies the "fat" to trim while preserving core functionality.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Architecture Violations (URGENT)
- **config.py**: 448 lines (148 lines over limit)
- **registry.py**: 742 lines (442 lines over limit)  
- **Test files**: 600-860 lines each
- **Countless violations** of the 8-line function rule

### 2. Bloated Subsystems
- **Total Python Files**: 1,155 in core application (not 29K - that was total including dependencies)
  - **app/**: 1,008 files
  - **scripts/**: 95 files  
  - **test_framework/**: 17 files
  - **dev_launcher/**: 19 files
- **Agent System**: 126 files with exotic sub-agents
- **Services**: 206 service files (massive over-engineering)
- **Tests**: 400 test files with custom orchestrators
- **WebSocket**: 15+ files for basic WebSocket handling
- **Error Handling**: 34 separate error/exception files

## Team Assignments (3 Engineers)

### Engineer 1: Core Simplification
**Focus**: Reduce core complexity and enforce architecture rules

#### Week 1-2: Module Splitting & Cleanup
- [ ] Split config.py into 3 modules (<300 lines each):
  - `config_core.py`: Base configuration loading
  - `config_secrets.py`: Secret management  
  - `config_validation.py`: Validation logic
- [ ] Split registry.py into domain-specific registries:
  - `registry_core.py`: Core types only
  - `registry_websocket.py`: WebSocket types
  - `registry_agent.py`: Agent types
- [ ] Remove 50% of error/exception files by consolidation

#### Week 3-4: Service Layer Reduction
- [ ] Consolidate 206 service files to ~50 core services
- [ ] Remove these premature optimizations:
  - Database rollback managers (use transactions)
  - Complex unit of work patterns
  - Over-abstracted repository patterns
- [ ] Merge duplicate functionality

### Engineer 2: Agent System Streamlining  
**Focus**: Simplify agent architecture from 126 files to ~30

#### Week 1-2: Agent Consolidation
- [ ] Remove exotic sub-agents:
  - `actions_to_meet_goals_sub_agent.py`
  - `optimizations_core_sub_agent.py`
  - Complex corpus admin agents
- [ ] Keep only essential agents:
  - Supervisor agent
  - Base worker agent  
  - Essential tool dispatchers
- [ ] Consolidate agent error handling (12+ files → 2)

#### Week 3-4: Agent Communication Simplification
- [ ] Replace complex WebSocket message types (99 types → 15 essential)
- [ ] Remove redundant agent states
- [ ] Simplify agent monitoring (remove "insights", keep basic metrics)

### Engineer 3: Testing & Infrastructure
**Focus**: Reduce test complexity and remove exotic features

#### Week 1-2: Test Framework Simplification
- [ ] Remove custom test framework components:
  - Delta reporters
  - Test orchestrators
  - Test insights/profiling
  - Failure pattern analyzers
- [ ] Keep simple pytest with basic reporting
- [ ] Reduce 400 test files to ~100 focused tests
- [ ] Fix all tests exceeding 300 lines

#### Week 3-4: Feature Removal
- [ ] **Remove/Disable Exotic Features**:
  - Synthetic data generation system (12 files)
  - Complex audit system (can add back if needed)
  - Alert evaluation/notification system
  - ClickHouse query fixer/optimizer
  - Database index optimizer
- [ ] **Simplify WebSocket** (15 files → 5):
  - Keep: connection, validation, basic handlers
  - Remove: batch handlers, recovery managers, heartbeat complexity

## Configuration Changes

### Disable in config (immediate relief):
```python
# Disable these features in config files
ENABLE_SYNTHETIC_DATA = False
ENABLE_AUDIT_SYSTEM = False  
ENABLE_ALERT_MANAGER = False
ENABLE_INDEX_OPTIMIZATION = False
ENABLE_QUERY_FIXER = False
ENABLE_TEST_INSIGHTS = False
ENABLE_DELTA_REPORTING = False
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate (Week 1):
- 30% reduction in startup time
- 40% reduction in memory usage
- Compliance with 300-line module rule

### Month 1:
- **File Count**: 1,155 → ~400 files (65% reduction)
- **Agent Files**: 126 → 30
- **Service Files**: 206 → 50  
- **Test Files**: 400 → 100
- **Complexity**: 70% reduction

### Benefits:
- Faster development cycles
- Easier onboarding
- Reduced cognitive load
- Better maintainability
- Clearer architecture

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Immediate):
1. Disable exotic features via config
2. Split oversized files
3. Remove unused agent sub-systems

### Phase 2 (Week 1-2):
1. Consolidate error handling
2. Simplify WebSocket implementation
3. Remove test framework complexity

### Phase 3 (Week 3-4):
1. Service layer consolidation
2. Database layer simplification
3. Final cleanup and validation

## Success Metrics
- All files ≤300 lines
- All functions ≤8 lines  
- 60% reduction in total files
- 50% reduction in test execution time
- Zero architectural violations

## Rollback Plan
- Git branch protection for safe rollback
- Feature flags for gradual disabling
- Keep removed code in `deprecated/` folder for 30 days

## Notes
- Keep the core multi-agent architecture
- Preserve essential WebSocket functionality
- Maintain PostgreSQL as primary DB (question ClickHouse necessity)
- Focus on "YAGNI" (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle
- Can always add complexity back when actually needed
