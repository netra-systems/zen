# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Frontend Build Caching Issues Fixed

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Docker layer caching issue**: .dockerignore was excluding `.next` directory entirely
2. **Missing BuildKit cache mounts**: Dockerfiles weren't using cache mounts for npm and Next.js build cache
3. **Poor layer ordering**: Source files copied all at once, invalidating cache on any change
4. **Missing TypeScript path mapping**: `@/auth` path not configured in tsconfig.json

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Fixed .dockerignore
- Modified to preserve `.next/cache` directory
- Excluded only `.next/server` and `.next/static` (build outputs)
- This allows Docker to use Next.js build cache

#### 2. Optimized Dockerfiles
**Dockerfile.frontend.optimized:**
- Added `# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1` for BuildKit features
- Added cache mounts for npm cache: `--mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm`
- Added cache mount for Next.js cache: `--mount=type=cache,target=/app/.next/cache`
- Reorganized COPY layers by change frequency (static â†’ dynamic)

**Dockerfile.frontend.staging:**
- Applied same optimizations as above
- Improved layer caching strategy

#### 3. Fixed TypeScript Configuration
- Added `@/auth` path mapping to tsconfig.json
- Resolves module import errors during build

#### 4. Created Deployment Scripts
- `deploy_staging_local.py`: Simplified deployment script supporting Docker and ACT
- Supports cached and no-cache builds
- Provides easy commands for local staging deployment

## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Docker Compose
```bash
# With BuildKit enabled
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
export COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d
```

### Method 2: Using Deployment Script
```bash
# Deploy with Docker Compose (uses cache)
python deploy_staging_local.py docker cache

# Deploy without cache
python deploy_staging_local.py docker no-cache

# Deploy with ACT (GitHub Actions locally)
python deploy_staging_local.py act

# Stop services
python deploy_staging_local.py stop
```

### Method 3: ACT (GitHub Actions Locally)
```bash
# Run staging workflow locally
python run_staging_with_act.py
```

## Performance Improvements
- **First build**: Full build required
- **Subsequent builds with changes**: 
  - npm dependencies cached (saves ~40s)
  - Next.js build cache preserved (saves ~10-20s)
  - Only changed layers rebuilt
- **No changes**: Uses all cached layers (<5s)

## Verification Steps
1. Check BuildKit is enabled: `docker buildx version`
2. Monitor cache usage during build (look for "CACHED" in output)
3. Verify services: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml ps`
4. Access endpoints:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend: http://localhost:8080
   - Proxy: http://localhost:80

## Troubleshooting
- If build fails with module errors: Rebuild without cache once
- If ACT fails: Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- For Windows: Use `set` instead of `export` for environment variables
