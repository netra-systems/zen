# Issue #1176 - Unit Test Failures Status Update

**Current Failing Tests (2025-09-16):**

## 1. Agent Execution Timeout Test
- **Test:** `netra_backend/tests/unit/agents/supervisor/test_agent_execution_core_business_logic_comprehensive.py::AgentExecutionCoreBusinessTests::test_timeout_protection_prevents_hung_agents`
- **Issue:** Test expects `execution_core.websocket_bridge.notify_agent_error.assert_called()` to be called when timeout occurs, but it's not being called
- **Error:** `AssertionError: Expected 'notify_agent_error' to have been called.`
- **Analysis:** The timeout protection mechanism exists but the WebSocket error notification is not being triggered as expected in the test scenario

## 2. Auth Service Business Logic Test
- **Test:** `auth_service/tests/unit/golden_path/test_auth_service_business_logic.py::AuthServiceBusinessLogicTests::test_user_registration_business_rules`
- **Issue:** Test collection/execution error with extensive logging output but fails before actual test execution
- **Error:** Collection error (full traceback shows configuration and setup issues)
- **Analysis:** The test appears to have dependency or configuration issues preventing proper execution

## Status Assessment

**Current Test Infrastructure State:**
- **Agent Core Tests:** Functional but WebSocket bridge notification logic needs investigation
- **Auth Service Tests:** Collection/configuration issues preventing execution
- **System Dependencies:** Multiple deprecation warnings indicating ongoing SSOT migration work

**Impact on Golden Path:**
- Critical business logic tests are failing or not executing
- WebSocket notification system may have gaps in timeout scenarios
- Auth service validation is blocked

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions (Priority 0):**
1. **Five Whys Analysis:** Conduct root cause analysis of WebSocket bridge notification issue
2. **Auth Test Repair:** Fix configuration/dependency issues blocking auth service test execution
3. **Validation:** Ensure fixes don't introduce breaking changes to existing functionality

**Remediation Plan:**
1. Investigate why `notify_agent_error` is not called during timeout scenarios
2. Fix auth service test collection/configuration issues
3. Validate WebSocket bridge timeout notification flow works correctly
4. Ensure SSOT migration compliance doesn't break existing test functionality

**Timeline:**
- Analysis and initial fixes: 24 hours
- Complete remediation and validation: 48 hours

**Status:** Actively investigating and will proceed with systematic remediation following the Five Whys methodology to ensure proper resolution of underlying issues.
