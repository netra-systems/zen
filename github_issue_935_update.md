## âœ… CONFIRMED REPRODUCTION - 2025-09-14

### Test Execution Results
Executed the failing test and confirmed the issue is still active:

```bash
python3 tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py::TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_tool_completed_event_structure
```

### Failure Details
```
AssertionError: tool_completed missing results
assert 'results' in {'correlation_id': None, 'data': {'connection_id': 'main_7009a890', 'features': {'agent_orchestration': True, 'cloud_run_optimized': True, 'emergency_fallback': True, 'full_business_logic': True, ...}, 'golden_path_events': ['agent_started', 'agent_thinking', 'tool_executing', 'tool_completed', 'agent_completed'], 'mode': 'main', ...}, 'server_id': None, 'timestamp': 1757857638.4094255, ...}
```

### Current Event Payload Analysis
The WebSocket server is returning a `connection_established` event instead of a proper `tool_completed` event:

**Received Event:**
```json
{
  "correlation_id": null,
  "data": {
    "connection_id": "main_7009a890",
    "features": {
      "agent_orchestration": true,
      "cloud_run_optimized": true,
      "emergency_fallback": true,
      "full_business_logic": true
    },
    "golden_path_events": ["agent_started", "agent_thinking", "tool_executing", "tool_completed", "agent_completed"],
    "mode": "main"
  },
  "server_id": null,
  "timestamp": 1757857638.4094255,
  "type": "connection_established"
}
```

### Root Cause Identified
- **Issue:** WebSocket server sends `connection_established` events instead of `tool_completed` events
- **Missing Field:** The `results` field is completely absent from the event payload
- **Event Type Mismatch:** Test expects `tool_completed` but receives `connection_established`

### Business Impact Confirmed
- **$500K+ ARR at risk** - Users cannot see tool execution outcomes
- **Golden Path BLOCKED** - Essential feedback loop broken  
- **User Trust Impact** - Tool transparency compromised

### Connection to Issue #1021
This issue is part of the broader WebSocket Event Structure Validation failures tracked in Issue #1021 (P0 Critical). All three failing tests show the same pattern:
- Server returns `connection_established` instead of specific event types
- Required fields missing from event payloads  
- WebSocket event emission not aligned with validation requirements

**Status:** P1 CONFIRMED - Issue reproduced on staging environment, root cause identified

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix WebSocket event emission to send correct event types
2. Ensure `tool_completed` events include `results` field
3. Align with broader WebSocket structure fixes in Issue #1021
