## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL VALIDATION: Staging Test Failures Confirm WebSocket SSOT Violation

### Test Discovery Results - Step 1.1 Complete

**CRITICAL FINDINGS**:
- **Discovered**: 3,733 WebSocket-related test files, 1,379 WebSocket manager specific
- **STAGING FAILURE CONFIRMATION**: Real-time staging tests show WebSocket connection failures validating our SSOT fragmentation diagnosis
- **Production Impact**: WebSocket connection issues directly blocking golden path user flow

### Staging Test Evidence

Latest staging test results show **consistent WebSocket connection failures**:
- `websockets.connect` failing across multiple test scenarios
- Agent pipeline execution blocked by WebSocket issues
- Agent lifecycle monitoring failing due to WebSocket connection problems

This directly confirms our SSOT audit findings that **multiple WebSocket manager implementations are causing race conditions and connection failures**.

### Test Infrastructure Analysis

**Mission Critical Tests Identified**:
- `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py` - Golden path protection
- Multiple SSOT compliance tests for WebSocket manager validation
- Comprehensive event delivery test coverage

**Next Steps**:
- Step 2: Execute test plan for 20% new SSOT validation tests
- Focus on WebSocket connection failure remediation
- Validate SSOT consolidation resolves staging failures

**Business Impact**: Staging failures directly validate the $500K+ ARR risk assessment - golden path is broken in production-like environment.
