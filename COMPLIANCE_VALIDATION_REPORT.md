# Comprehensive Compliance Validation Report

**Generated:** 2025-08-30 14:34:09
**Overall Compliance:** 5.5%
**Status:** ❌ FAILED

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive validation of all system compliance requirements
including mock policy, environment isolation, architecture standards, real service
connections, and WebSocket functionality.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Mock Violations | 1370 | ❌ |
| Environment Violations | 159 | ❌ |
| Architecture Violations | 9999 | ❌ |
| Test Quality Score | 44.7% | ❌ |
| WebSocket Events | FAILING | ❌ |
| Real Service Connections | FAILING | ❌ |

## Critical Issues

- ❌ 1370 mock violations detected
- ❌ 159 environment isolation violations
- ❌ Architecture compliance at 0.0% (need 90%+)
- ❌ Real service connections failing
- ❌ WebSocket agent events not working

## Recommendations

- 🔧 Remove ALL mock usage and use real services with IsolatedEnvironment
- 🔧 Convert all tests to use IsolatedEnvironment instead of direct os.environ
- 🔧 Address architectural violations: file size, function complexity, etc.
- 🔧 Fix real service connections using docker-compose
- 🔧 Fix WebSocket agent event emission and handling


## Compliance Score Breakdown

The overall compliance score of 5.5% is calculated as:

- Mock Policy Compliance: 0% (30% weight)
- Environment Isolation: 0% (15% weight)  
- Architecture Compliance: Variable based on violations (25% weight)
- Real Service Connections: 0% (15% weight)
- WebSocket Events: 0% (15% weight)

## Next Steps

Address the critical issues above before deployment. Compliance must reach 90%+.
