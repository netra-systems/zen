## Merge Strategy Decision

**DECISION:** Use `git merge` (not rebase) to preserve history as specified in instructions
**RATIONALE:** 
- Instructions explicitly state "ALWAYS PREFER GIT MERGE over rebase, rebase is dangerous!"
- Both local and remote changes appear to be documentation/testing focused
- No apparent conflicts expected - different areas of work
- Preserves complete history and context for both branches

## Risk Assessment

**CONFLICT RISK:** LOW
- Local changes: Documentation files in test results and golden path analysis
- Remote changes: Mix of documentation, testing infrastructure, and SSOT fixes
- Likely no file overlap causing merge conflicts

**REPOSITORY SAFETY:** HIGH
- All changes appear to be additive (docs, tests, configs)
- No core system code modifications that could break functionality
- Following explicit instruction to preserve history and stay on current branch

## Merge Execution Plan

1. Execute: `git merge origin/develop-long-lived`
2. Handle any conflicts if they arise (document decisions here)
3. Validate merge success
4. Proceed with atomic commits for current changes
5. Push merged result

## Merge Execution Results

**MERGE STATUS:** ✅ SUCCESS - No conflicts
**MERGE STRATEGY:** `ort` strategy (automatic)
**FILES CHANGED:** 38 files changed, 15439 insertions(+), 12 deletions(-)

### Key Additions from Remote:
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure (Docker, Database, WebSocket integration tests)
- Multiple PR worklog documents and safety assessments
- CI compliance monitoring system
- SSOT enhancements and unified ID manager
- WebSocket 1011 error fixes

## Post-Merge Validation

- [x] Check git status shows clean merge ✅
- [x] Verify all remote changes integrated ✅ (38 files, 15,439 additions)
- [x] Confirm local work preserved ✅ (Both local commits preserved)

## Final Status

**REPOSITORY HEALTH:** EXCELLENT - Clean merge, no conflicts
**LOCAL WORK:** Preserved - both commits maintained
**REMOTE INTEGRATION:** Complete - all 13 remote commits integrated
**NEXT PHASE:** Ready to proceed with atomic commit process for current changes
