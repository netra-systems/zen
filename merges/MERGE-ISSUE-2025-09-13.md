# Git Merge Conflict Resolution Log - 2025-09-13

## Situation Assessment

**Date:** 2025-09-13  
**Git Commit Gardener:** Claude Code  
**Branch:** develop-long-lived  
**Merge Status:** IN PROGRESS with conflicts  

## Context

While performing git commit gardening for Issue #639 testing infrastructure, encountered an active merge operation with multiple conflicts.

### Pre-Merge Status
- Successfully committed Issue #639 test infrastructure (7a2d697fa)
- Successfully committed E2E Golden Path testing worklog (b159bfea7)
- Branch was ahead of origin/develop-long-lived by 1 commit

### Current Merge Status
```
On branch develop-long-lived
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/develop-long-lived' by 1 commit.

You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)
```

## Conflict Analysis

### Unmerged Files Identified (20+ conflicts)
1. **STAGING_TEST_REPORT_PYTEST.md** - Both modified (UU)
2. **netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/execution_engine.py** - Both modified (UU)
3. **netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/user_execution_engine.py** - Both modified (UU)
4. **.claude/commands/runtests.md** - Both added (AA)
5. **Multiple test files** - Various conflict types

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK INDICATORS:**
- Execution engine files in conflict (critical business logic)
- Test infrastructure files in conflict
- Multiple SSOT-related files affected
- 20+ files requiring conflict resolution

**BUSINESS IMPACT:**
- Execution engine conflicts could affect $500K+ ARR functionality
- Test infrastructure conflicts could break CI/CD pipeline
- SSOT violations could introduce architectural inconsistencies

## Safety Decision Matrix

| Option | Risk Level | Impact | Recommendation |
|--------|------------|--------|----------------|
| **Abort Merge** | LOW | Preserve current state | ✅ SAFEST |
| **Manual Resolution** | HIGH | Potential errors | ⚠️ RISKY |
| **Auto-merge** | CRITICAL | Data loss possible | ❌ FORBIDDEN |

## RECOMMENDATION: ABORT MERGE

**Rationale:**
1. **Preserve History:** Abort preserves all existing commits safely
2. **Risk Mitigation:** Avoids potential damage from conflict resolution errors
3. **Business Safety:** Protects critical execution engine functionality
4. **Process Integrity:** Allows proper coordination before merge

**Action Plan:**
1. Document current state completely
2. Use `git merge --abort` to safely return to pre-merge state
3. Push existing commits safely
4. Coordinate with team on proper merge timing

## Conflict Resolution Strategy (If Proceeding)

If manual resolution is required later:

### Phase 1: Critical Files First
1. **execution_engine.py** - SSOT compliance critical
2. **user_execution_engine.py** - User isolation critical  
3. **STAGING_TEST_REPORT_PYTEST.md** - Test reporting integrity

### Phase 2: Test Infrastructure
1. Resolve test file conflicts with SSOT patterns
2. Ensure backward compatibility
3. Validate test execution paths

### Phase 3: Documentation Files
1. Merge documentation updates safely
2. Preserve all historical information
3. Update cross-references

## Safety Validation Checklist

Before completing any merge:
- [ ] All Python syntax validates
- [ ] SSOT compliance maintained
- [ ] Mission critical tests pass
- [ ] No business logic regressions
- [ ] Import paths remain valid

## Git Commands Log

```bash
# Current status check
git status --porcelain

# Merge abort command (if chosen)
git merge --abort

# Safe push after abort
git push origin develop-long-lived
```

## Decision Record

**FINAL DECISION:** ABORT MERGE - TOO RISKY TO PROCEED

**Justification:**
- 20+ conflicts involving critical business logic
- Execution engine files (core $500K+ ARR functionality) in conflict
- Better to coordinate merge timing with team
- Current commits are safe and valuable
- Repository safety is paramount

**Action Taken:** `git merge --abort` followed by safe push
