### Conflict Resolution Details:
**File:** `STAGING_TEST_REPORT_PYTEST.md`
**Conflict Type:** Content inconsistency in test report results

- ✅ Maintained document structure integrity
- ✅ Ensured Executive Summary, Pytest Output, and Coverage Matrix are aligned

consistency across all sections of the test report, showing 0 tests executed throughout
all sections rather than having inconsistent data that would confuse readers.
