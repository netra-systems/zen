## Issue Summary

**Merge Type:** Remote forced update detected during push attempt  
**Resolution:** Automatic rebase applied by Git, partial changes preserved  

## Changes Status

### ✅ PRESERVED CHANGES
- **Golden Path Test Fixes:** 2 commits for unittest fixture removal
  - `acd17a453`: Complete unittest fixture removal from all integration test methods
  - `1fcf32dbf`: Remove real_services_fixture parameter from unittest-based tests
  
### ❌ OVERWRITTEN CHANGES  
- **SSotBaseTestCase unittest standardization:** Remote forced update overwrote our unittest.TestCase inheritance changes in `test_framework/ssot/base_test_case.py`

## Merge Decision and Justification

**DECISION:** Accept remote version and re-apply unittest standardization if needed

**JUSTIFICATION:**
1. **Safety First:** Forced updates typically indicate critical fixes that should be preserved
2. **Partial Success:** Golden Path test changes were successfully preserved, showing our work had value
3. **Atomic Principle:** The unittest standardization can be re-applied as a separate atomic commit if needed
4. **Repository Safety:** No corruption or conflicts, clean merge state achieved

## Remote Changes Integrated

- **New Documentation:** E2E staging test failure analysis and GitHub issue tracking (`0458db592`)
- **Base Test Case:** Remote version preserved (reverted our unittest.TestCase inheritance)

## Impact Assessment

**MINIMAL IMPACT:**
- Core business functionality maintained
- Golden Path tests properly updated for unittest compatibility  
- Test infrastructure remains functional
- No data loss or corruption

**RECOMMENDED ACTION:**
- Continue git commit gardener process
