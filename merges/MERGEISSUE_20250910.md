# Merge Issue Resolution: 2025-09-10

## Situation
Branch `critical-remediation-20250823` has diverged from remote with 13 local commits vs 14 remote commits. Merge conflict detected in:
- `tests/e2e/test_results/ULTIMATE_TEST_DEPLOY_LOOP_GOLDEN_PATH_DATA_AGENT_FOCUS_20250910.md`

## Analysis
- **Local commits**: 13 atomic commits following SPEC/git_commit_atomic_units.xml
- **Remote commits**: 14 commits with ongoing development work
- **Conflict nature**: Test result documentation with concurrent updates

## Decision
**STASH LOCAL CHANGES** and **PULL CLEAN** approach:
1. Stash remaining uncommitted changes
2. Pull remote changes with clean merge
3. Push our 13 atomic commits
4. Re-apply stashed changes in new commit if needed

## Reasoning
- Preserves all atomic commit history
- Avoids complex merge conflicts in documentation files
- Follows CLAUDE.md safety guidelines for merge operations
- Maintains clean git history for repository health

## Implementation
```bash
git stash push -m "WIP: Additional changes post atomic commits 20250910"
git pull origin critical-remediation-20250823 --no-rebase
git push origin critical-remediation-20250823
git stash pop  # If additional work needed
```

## Risk Assessment
- **LOW RISK**: Documentation conflicts only
- **NO CODE CONFLICTS**: Core system files unaffected
- **ATOMIC COMMITS PRESERVED**: All 13 conceptual commits maintained
- **BUSINESS CONTINUITY**: No impact on critical functionality

## OUTCOME: SUCCESS âœ…
- **Merge Completed**: 679be766c successful merge with remote branch
- **Commits Pushed**: All 13 atomic commits successfully pushed to origin
- **Remote State**: Branch synchronized with remote repository
- **Stashed Changes**: Additional WIP changes preserved in stash@{0}
- **Repository Health**: Clean merge, no conflicts, history preserved
