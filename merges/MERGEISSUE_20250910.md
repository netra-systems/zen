# Merge Issue Documentation - September 10, 2025

## Initial State
- **Branch**: critical-remediation-20250823
- **Status**: Branch appeared diverged with 5 local vs 3 remote commits
- **Working Tree**: Initially appeared clean, later found to have 2 modified files

## Merge Analysis
- **Local Only Commits**: 1 commit (e6b765ff7 - "feat(async): complete async database session integration and triage agent updates")
- **Remote Only Commits**: None found
- **Conflict Risk**: Low - no overlapping remote changes

## Merge Strategy Decision
**DECISION**: Use git merge (not rebase) as per CLAUDE.md directive
**JUSTIFICATION**: 
- Safer than rebase for preserving history
- No complex conflicts expected
- Repository health preservation is priority

## Merge Execution
1. **Fetch**: `git fetch origin` - successful
2. **Pull Attempt**: `git pull origin critical-remediation-20250823 --no-rebase`
3. **Result**: "Already up to date" - no new remote commits to merge
4. **Status**: Branch now shows as up to date with origin

## Uncommitted Changes Found
After merge completion, found 2 modified files requiring commits:
- `netra_backend/app/websocket_core/agent_handler.py` - Database session async pattern changes
- `netra_backend/app/agents/triage/unified_triage_agent.py` - Enhanced intent detection keywords

## Atomic Commit Planning
Following SPEC/git_commit_atomic_units.xml:
- **Commit 1**: Database async pattern improvement (WebSocket handler)
- **Commit 2**: Intent detection enhancement (Triage agent)
- **Rationale**: Two separate concepts, independent review/rollback capability

## Safety Measures
- No force operations used
- History preserved intact
- Working on current branch (critical-remediation-20250823)
- Each commit will be tested before proceeding

## Next Steps
1. Create atomic commits for identified changes
2. Push to remote
3. Verify repository health
