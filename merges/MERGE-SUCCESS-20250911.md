# Git Merge Decision Log - 2025-09-11

**Operation:** Git Commit Gardening - PR Worklog Documentation  
**Date:** 2025-09-11  
**Branch:** develop-long-lived  
**Commit:** fc6bd77a7  

## Operation Summary

Successfully committed two PR worklog documentation files as a single conceptual unit per SPEC/git_commit_atomic_units.xml guidelines.

## Files Committed
- `PR-WORKLOG-282-20250911.md` - Safety assessment for PR #282 (enterprise validation fix)
- `PR-WORKLOG-286-20250911-042500.md` - Analysis for PR #286 (UserContextManager implementation)

## Decision Rationale

**Atomic Unit Justification:**
- Both files represent the same conceptual work: PR documentation updates
- Created on same date for related business safety processes
- Follow same documentation format and serve same purpose
- Grouping aligns with git commit atomic principles (concept over file count)

## Safety Checks Performed

✅ **Branch Verification:** Stayed on develop-long-lived as required  
✅ **History Preservation:** Used git merge preference over rebase  
✅ **Conflict Assessment:** No conflicts detected during pull  
✅ **Repository Health:** Working tree clean after operations  
✅ **Push Verification:** Successfully pushed to origin/develop-long-lived  

## Merge Operations

1. **Initial Status:** 2 untracked worklog files on develop-long-lived
2. **Branch Safety:** Corrected accidental branch switch, returned to develop-long-lived  
3. **Staging:** Added both files as single conceptual unit
4. **Commit:** Created atomic commit with proper message format
5. **Sync:** Pulled latest (no conflicts), pushed successfully
6. **Verification:** Confirmed commit in history and repository health

## Branch Management

**No Merge Required:** This was a simple commit operation of new documentation files, not a branch merge. All operations stayed within develop-long-lived branch.

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** MINIMAL  
- Documentation-only changes
- No code changes affecting functionality  
- No merge conflicts encountered
- Clean repository state maintained

## Outcome

✅ **SUCCESS:** PR worklog documentation safely committed and pushed  
✅ **SAFETY:** Repository health maintained, proper branch management  
✅ **COMPLIANCE:** Followed SSOT atomic commit guidelines  

**Next Steps:** Continue monitoring PR safety assessment processes documented in these worklogs.
