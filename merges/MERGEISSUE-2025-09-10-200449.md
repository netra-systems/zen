  - Purpose: KeyError fix verification and validation
  - Impact: Documentation enhancement, no code changes

#### Deleted Files  
- **test_logging_fixes.py** (246 lines)
  - Type: Test file removal
  - Purpose: Test cleanup/consolidation
  - Impact: Reduced test file duplication

### Net Change Impact
- **Lines Added:** +206 (documentation)
- **Lines Removed:** -246 (test cleanup)
- **Net Change:** -40 lines (code reduction)
- **File Count:** -1 file (consolidation)
