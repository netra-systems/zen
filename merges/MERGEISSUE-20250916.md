# Git Merge Conflict Resolution Log

**Date:** 2025-09-16  
**Commit Date:** 2025-09-16  
**Branch:** develop-long-lived  
**Merge Context:** Resolving diverged branches (53 ahead, 72 behind origin)

## Safety Approach

**CRITICAL SAFETY MEASURES:**
- Preserve history - no destructive operations
- Stay on current branch (develop-long-lived)
- Document all decisions with justification
- Prefer GIT MERGE over rebase (as instructed)
- Stop if serious merge problems arise

## Conflicts Identified

Total conflicts: 4 files

### 1. STAGING_TEST_REPORT_PYTEST.md
**Conflict Type:** Different test report results  
**HEAD:** Test passed (100% success rate, 0.20s duration, generated 2025-09-15 18:46:07)  
**Incoming:** Test failed (0% success rate, 24.53s duration, generated 2025-09-15 19:49:08)  

**Analysis:** Both are valid test reports from different runs. The incoming version is more recent (19:49 vs 18:46) and shows actual test failures that need to be visible.

**DECISION:** Accept INCOMING version  
**Justification:** More recent timestamp and shows current test state (failures should be visible for debugging)

### 2. dockerfiles/frontend.staging.alpine.Dockerfile
**Conflict Type:** Flag ordering in npm command  
**HEAD:** `RUN npm ci --legacy-peer-deps --production`  
**Incoming:** `RUN npm ci --production --legacy-peer-deps`  

**Analysis:** Functionally identical, just different flag ordering. Both achieve the same result.

**DECISION:** Accept INCOMING version  
**Justification:** Both work identically, choosing incoming for consistency with merge direction

### 3. netra_backend/tests/unit/websocket_core/test_create_server_message_signature_error.py
**Conflict Type:** Different SSOT compliance testing approaches  
**HEAD:** Complete SSOT consolidation - tests only canonical implementation, eliminates dual imports  
**Incoming:** SSOT validation - tests that both imports reference same function object  

**Analysis:** HEAD represents more complete SSOT compliance (eliminated dual imports entirely), while incoming validates that dual imports point to same object. HEAD shows progression to true SSOT (single source).

**DECISION:** Accept HEAD version  
**Justification:** Represents more mature SSOT implementation with complete consolidation rather than just validation of dual imports

### 4. test_framework/ssot/base_test_case.py
**Conflict Type:** Different async event loop handling strategies  
**HEAD:** Pytest-asyncio context detection with safe_run_async method  
**Incoming:** Threading approach with concurrent.futures for sync/async bridging  

**Analysis:** HEAD uses more sophisticated detection of pytest-asyncio context and avoids conflicts. Incoming uses threading which could introduce complexity. HEAD appears more stable.

**DECISION:** Accept HEAD version  
**Justification:** More sophisticated async handling, better pytest-asyncio integration, avoids threading complexity

## Resolution Commands

```bash
# Resolve conflicts by accepting chosen versions
git checkout HEAD -- test_framework/ssot/base_test_case.py
git checkout HEAD -- netra_backend/tests/unit/websocket_core/test_create_server_message_signature_error.py
git checkout 8f30a7dce68b2b833a9cac45c293de4b00d727cf -- STAGING_TEST_REPORT_PYTEST.md
git checkout 8f30a7dce68b2b833a9cac45c293de4b00d727cf -- dockerfiles/frontend.staging.alpine.Dockerfile
```

## Risk Assessment

**LOW RISK** - All conflicts are in documentation, configuration, or test files. No production code logic affected.

**Risk Factors:**
- Test report changes: Documentation only, no impact
- Dockerfile changes: Functionally equivalent flags
- Test code changes: HEAD version more robust
- Base test case: HEAD version more sophisticated

**Mitigation:**
- All changes are in test infrastructure or documentation
- No breaking changes to production functionality
- Changes align with SSOT compliance goals
- Preserved all staging configuration functionality

## Post-Merge Validation Required

1. **Test Infrastructure:** Verify SSOT base test case works correctly
2. **WebSocket Tests:** Ensure SSOT compliance tests pass
3. **Docker Build:** Confirm frontend dockerfile builds correctly
4. **Test Reports:** Verify test report structure maintained

## Business Value Justification

**Segment:** Platform (Development Infrastructure)  
**Goal:** Stability and SSOT Compliance  
**Value Impact:** Maintains test infrastructure stability while advancing SSOT goals  
**Revenue Impact:** Prevents technical debt that could slow development velocity
