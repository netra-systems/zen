# Merge Conflict Resolution - September 16, 2025

## Files in Conflict
- `reports/MASTER_WIP_STATUS.md`

## Conflict Description
Merge conflict between current branch content and incoming changes from `origin/develop-long-lived`. The incoming branch contains a critical infrastructure crisis status (Issue #1176) indicating test infrastructure problems, while the local branch had a stable production-ready status.

## Resolution Chosen
**KEEP INCOMING CHANGES** - Accept the critical infrastructure crisis status from the remote branch.

## Justification
1. **Safety First**: The incoming changes highlight critical test infrastructure issues (false success reports)
2. **Accuracy**: The crisis status appears to be based on actual findings from Issue #1176
3. **Current State**: The infrastructure crisis status is more recent and reflects actual testing problems
4. **Business Risk**: False success reports in testing infrastructure pose significant risk to $500K+ ARR

## Resolution Details
- Accepted the "Infrastructure Crisis - Issue #1176 Remediation" status
- Kept all critical findings about test infrastructure false success reports
- Maintained the comprehensive remediation documentation
- Preserved the accurate deployment readiness assessment (NOT ready for production)

## Impact Assessment
This resolution ensures accurate system status reporting and prevents deployment of potentially unstable code based on false test success reports.
