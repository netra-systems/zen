- ✅ **Test Infrastructure Integration:** Combined test approaches for comprehensive coverage
- ✅ **WebSocket Reliability:** Preserved both migration and error validation strategies

### Phase 3: Resolution Implementation
```bash
# Resolution approach for each file:
1. websocket_error_validator.py: Enhanced compatibility service preserving both patterns
2. migration_adapter.py: Unified migration strategy with factory isolation
3. websocket_manager_factory.py: SSOT-compliant factory with Golden Path support
4. test_agent_orchestration_execution_comprehensive.py: Comprehensive test combining approaches
```

### Phase 4: Concurrent Development Integration
**Challenge:** Active development continued during merge resolution
**New Developments Detected:**
- Agent execution core enhancements (test_agent_execution_core.py)
- Race condition test suite improvements
- Cache key generation and query optimization modules
- Auth integration and security compliance modules

**Integration Strategy:** Preserve all concurrent developments while completing merge
