# Merge Strategy Document - 2025-09-17

## Current Repository State

- **Current Branch:** develop-long-lived  
- **Local commits ahead:** 54 (including 3 new commits just added)
- **Remote commits behind:** 3 (need to be integrated)

## Recent Local Commits Added

1. **test: add test discovery and runner utilities** (e733942b3)
   - Added test infrastructure utilities for better test management

2. **feat: add current logs analysis utility** (0d186392e)  
   - Added log analysis capabilities for debugging

3. **docs: add git maintenance and GCP log analysis documentation** (65b62d9b4)
   - Added operational documentation

## Merge Strategy

### Pre-Merge Checklist
- [x] All untracked files committed in atomic units
- [x] Working directory clean
- [ ] Remote changes fetched (requires approval)
- [ ] Merge conflicts identified (if any)

### Recommended Merge Command

git pull --no-rebase origin develop-long-lived

**Rationale:** Using --no-rebase to preserve history and avoid dangerous rebase operations as per project guidelines.

### Expected Remote Changes (Based on Previous Analysis)

1. **Documentation Updates**
   - issue_984_resolution_comment.txt - Issue resolution documentation
   - issue_1277_comment.txt - Issue resolution documentation

2. **Code Fixes**
   - netra_backend/app/agents/data_sub_agent/__init__.py - Duplicate import fix
   - tests/mission_critical/test_issue_942_fix.py - Test validation update

### Conflict Resolution Strategy

If conflicts arise:

1. **Documentation Files:** Accept both changes (merge both sets of documentation)
2. **Code Files:** 
   - For import fixes: Accept remote (likely cleaner fix)
   - For test files: Merge both changes if they test different aspects

### Post-Merge Validation

1. Run test suite to ensure no breakage: python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category unit --fast-fail

2. Check critical systems: python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py

3. Verify no duplicate imports: python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** LOW

- All changes appear to be non-breaking
- Documentation updates are additive
- Code fixes are minor corrections
- Test updates improve validation

## Merge Decision Log

**Date:** 2025-09-17  
**Decision:** PROCEED WITH MERGE  
**Justification:** 
- Clean working tree achieved
- All local work committed in atomic units
- Remote changes are minor and non-conflicting
- Risk assessment shows low probability of issues

## Manual Execution Required

Due to approval requirements, the following commands need manual execution:

1. Pull remote changes: git pull --no-rebase origin develop-long-lived

2. If conflicts occur, resolve and commit: git add . && git commit -m merge: resolve conflicts from remote develop-long-lived

3. Push merged changes: git push origin develop-long-lived
