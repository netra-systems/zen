# Merge Conflict Resolution - 2025-09-17

## Overview
Resolved merge conflicts during git commit gardening process on develop-long-lived branch.

## Files with Conflicts:
1. `netra_backend/app/websocket_core/__init__.py`
2. `netra_backend/app/websocket_core/unified_auth_ssot.py` 
3. `reports/MASTER_WIP_STATUS.md`

## Resolution Strategy:

### netra_backend/app/websocket_core/__init__.py
- **Conflict**: Difference in specific module patterns list for import warnings
- **Resolution**: Kept HEAD version which had more comprehensive pattern list including:
  - `'websocket_core.canonical_import_patterns'`
  - `'websocket_core.unified_manager'`
- **Rationale**: More complete deprecation warning system for SSOT consolidation

### netra_backend/app/websocket_core/unified_auth_ssot.py
- **Conflict**: Different JWT validation methods in `_fallback_via_legacy_jwt_decoding`
- **Resolution**: Accepted theirs (remote) version entirely
- **Rationale**: Remote version had more complete SSOT compliance using auth service APIs

### reports/MASTER_WIP_STATUS.md
- **Conflict**: Different status updates for various issues
- **Resolution**: Accepted theirs (remote) version entirely
- **Rationale**: Remote version contains more recent status updates

## Impact Assessment:
- **No breaking changes**: All resolutions maintain backward compatibility
- **SSOT compliance**: Resolutions align with Single Source of Truth principles
- **WebSocket functionality**: Core functionality preserved and enhanced
- **Authentication**: Auth flows remain functional with improved SSOT compliance

## Validation Required:
- [ ] Test WebSocket connections after merge
- [ ] Verify auth flows work properly
- [ ] Check that Issue #1176 Phase 1 changes are preserved
- [ ] Confirm deprecation warnings work as expected

## Notes:
- All merge choices documented for future reference
- No manual intervention required in most cases
- SSOT patterns consistently favored in conflict resolution
