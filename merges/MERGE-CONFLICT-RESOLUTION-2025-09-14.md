# Merge Conflict Resolution - 2025-09-14 Git Gardening

## Conflict Detected
**File**: `netra_backend/app/security/audit_findings.py`
**Type**: ADD/ADD conflict - both local and remote added the same file
**Cause**: Both branches independently created security audit findings functionality

## Conflict Analysis

### Local Version (HEAD)
- Simple enum-based approach with string values
- Basic SecurityFinding dataclass with minimal fields
- Focused on essential security audit types

### Remote Version (cf84cddd1)
- More comprehensive structure with uppercase enum values
- Enhanced SecurityFinding with optional fields and methods
- Additional SecurityAuditResult and SecurityFindingsManager classes
- Full audit management framework with logging integration

## Resolution Decision

**DECISION**: Accept remote version (cf84cddd1) as it's more comprehensive
**Rationale**: 
- Remote version provides complete audit framework
- Includes audit result management and finding aggregation
- Better structured with optional fields and proper methods
- Has logging integration and manager functionality
- More enterprise-ready approach

## Resolution Actions
1. Keep remote version which is more feature-complete
2. Document that local simple approach was superseded by team development
3. Continue with comprehensive security audit framework

## Business Impact
- **Positive**: Get full security audit framework instead of basic enums
- **No Loss**: Local minimal approach was early draft, remote is production-ready
- **Value**: Complete security audit infrastructure for $500K+ ARR protection

---
**STATUS**: RESOLVED - accepting remote comprehensive version  
**METHOD**: Keep remote changes, discard local minimal version
