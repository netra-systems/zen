### Backend pytest.ini Conflict (Lines 127-135)

**Conflict Location:** `/netra_backend/pytest.ini` lines 127-135  
**Nature:** WebSocket testing markers conflict

**HEAD Branch Changes:**
```ini
issue_135: marks tests for Issue #135 basic triage response validation
```

**Incoming Branch Changes:**
```ini
protocol_parsing: marks tests for WebSocket protocol parsing functionality
protocol_negotiation: marks tests for WebSocket protocol negotiation
websocket_auth_protocol: marks tests for WebSocket authentication protocol
websocket_unified_auth: marks tests for WebSocket unified authentication
bug_reproduction: marks tests designed to reproduce specific bugs
```

## Resolution Strategy

### Business Logic Assessment
- **No Business Logic Impact:** These are pytest marker configurations only
- **Testing Enhancement:** Both branches add valuable testing categorization
- **Complementary Changes:** No conflicting or contradictory requirements
- **Safety Level:** HIGH - Pure configuration, no runtime effects

### Resolution Approach: MERGE BOTH SETS

**Rationale:**
1. **Complementary Markers:** issue_135 and Golden Path markers serve different purposes
2. **Enhanced Testing:** More granular test categorization improves CI/CD
3. **No Conflicts:** Different marker names, no naming collisions
4. **Business Value:** Support for both Issue #135 testing and Golden Path validation

### Resolved Configuration

**Root pytest.ini - Issue tracking markers section:**
```ini
# Issue tracking markers  
issue_131: Infrastructure resource validation tests for Issue #131
issue_135: Basic triage response validation tests for Issue #135
issue_144: Golden path database validation tests for Issue #144
issue_143: Infrastructure validation gaps preventing Golden Path verification for Issue #143
infrastructure_validation: Infrastructure validation and configuration gap testing
must_fail_initially: Tests designed to fail initially to reproduce bugs, expected failures for remediation
reproduction_tests: Bug reproduction and validation tests that recreate specific failure scenarios
golden_path_critical: Critical Golden Path end-to-end infrastructure validation tests

# Agent-WebSocket Integration Testing markers
agent_websocket_coordination: Agent-WebSocket coordination and bridge integration tests
agent_execution_flows: Agent execution pipeline and orchestration flow tests
websocket_event_handling: WebSocket event handling and delivery validation tests
edge_cases_error_scenarios: Edge cases, error scenarios and system boundary condition tests
```

**Backend pytest.ini - Testing markers section:**
```ini
issue_135: marks tests for Issue #135 basic triage response validation
protocol_parsing: marks tests for WebSocket protocol parsing functionality
protocol_negotiation: marks tests for WebSocket protocol negotiation
websocket_auth_protocol: marks tests for WebSocket authentication protocol
websocket_unified_auth: marks tests for WebSocket unified authentication
bug_reproduction: marks tests designed to reproduce specific bugs
```

## Safety Validation

- [x] **No Runtime Impact:** Configuration-only changes
- [x] **No Breaking Changes:** All existing markers preserved
- [x] **Backward Compatible:** Existing test runs unaffected
- [x] **Enhanced Functionality:** Better test categorization
- [x] **Business Value:** Supports both Issue #135 and Golden Path initiatives

## Implementation Status - PYTEST RESOLVED

**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED SUCCESSFULLY  
**Risk Assessment:** MINIMAL - Configuration only  
**Action Taken:** Applied merged configuration and staged for commit

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DISCOVERY - ADDITIONAL CONFLICTS FOUND

### HIGH-RISK WebSocket Business Logic Conflicts

**CRITICAL FILES WITH UNRESOLVED CONFLICTS:**
- `netra_backend/app/routes/websocket.py` (3 conflict areas)
- `test_framework/ssot/real_services_test_fixtures.py` (1 conflict area)

### WebSocket Conflict Analysis - HIGH BUSINESS IMPACT

**File:** `netra_backend/app/routes/websocket.py`  
**Business Impact:** CRITICAL - Handles $500K+ ARR chat functionality  
**Conflict Type:** Complex race condition prevention approaches

**HEAD Branch Approach:** "SINGLE COORDINATION STATE MACHINE"  
- Simplified single state machine initialization  
- Direct connection_id generation and state management
- Immediate transition to ACCEPTED state

**Incoming Branch Approach:** "PHASE 2/3 FIX" with HandshakeCoordinator  
- Multi-phase coordinator-based initialization
- Complex handshake coordination system  
- Race condition prevention through HandshakeCoordinator

### Risk Assessment for WebSocket Conflicts

**RISK LEVEL: EXTREME**
- Both approaches modify core WebSocket connection handling
- Different architectural patterns for the same problem
- Business-critical code affecting revenue-generating functionality
- Complex state management changes that could introduce subtle bugs
- Race condition fixes that could create new race conditions if merged incorrectly

### MERGE ABORT DECISION

**DECISION: ABORT MERGE - PRESERVE REPOSITORY SAFETY**

**Justification:**
1. **Business Risk Too High:** $500K+ ARR functionality could be compromised
2. **Architectural Conflict:** Two different approaches to race condition prevention
3. **Complexity Beyond Safe Resolution:** Multiple state machine strategies cannot be safely merged automatically
4. **Insufficient Context:** Need technical review to understand which approach is correct
5. **Gitcommitgardener Safety Mandate:** Repository safety over merge completion

### RECOMMENDED RESOLUTION STRATEGY

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. ‚úÖ Abort merge to preserve working state
2. ‚úÖ Document all conflict details for review
3. ‚úÖ Commit resolved pytest.ini changes separately  
4. ‚úÖ Create detailed technical analysis for team coordination

**STAGED RESOLUTION APPROACH:**
1. **Technical Review:** Team assessment of both WebSocket approaches
2. **Architecture Decision:** Choose single approach based on business requirements
3. **Incremental Integration:** Apply changes in smaller, testable units
4. **Validation:** Full test suite execution before any WebSocket changes

**Next Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Abort merge with `git merge --abort`
2. ‚úÖ Commit pytest.ini resolution separately
3. ‚úÖ Create detailed WebSocket conflict analysis document
4. üìã Schedule technical review for WebSocket conflict resolution
