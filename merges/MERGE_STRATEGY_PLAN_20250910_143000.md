### 🔴 EXPERIMENTAL BRANCHES (SKIP - HIGH RISK)

#### Rindhuja Development Branches
**Risk Assessment: 🔴 HIGH RISK - DO NOT MERGE**

All Rindhuja branches appear to be experimental development work with the following risks:

1. **`rindhuja-29-aug`** - Single commit "docker_updates" - unclear purpose
2. **`rindhuja-03-sept`** - 5 commits including WebSocketState changes, API updates
3. **`rindhuja-sep-01`** - 5 commits with compliance reports and E2E test updates  
4. **`rindhuja-sept-02`** - 5 commits with critical WebSocket changes, request-scoped dependencies
5. **`rindhuja-sept-04`** - 2 commits including merge from critical-remediation + local settings
6. **`rindhuja-sept-10`** - No unique commits

**CRITICAL CONCERNS:**
- Multiple overlapping changes with our SSOT branches
- Experimental nature unclear
- Potential to introduce conflicts or regressions
- No clear business justification
- Risk of destabilizing Golden Path functionality

**RECOMMENDATION:** SKIP ALL RINDHUJA BRANCHES until explicit approval and business case provided.

## MERGE STRATEGY EXECUTION PLAN

### PHASE 1: CRITICAL SSOT CONSOLIDATION (RECOMMENDED)

**Goal:** Safely merge the two critical SSOT branches that contain completed, tested work.

#### Step 1: Update Target Branch
```bash
git checkout develop-long-lived
git pull origin develop-long-lived
```

#### Step 2: Merge critical-remediation-20250823
```bash
git merge critical-remediation-20250823 --no-ff -m "Merge critical-remediation-20250823: WebSocket SSOT Phase 5 completion"
```

#### Step 3: Merge ssot-phase1-e2e-migration-188  
```bash
git merge ssot-phase1-e2e-migration-188 --no-ff -m "Merge ssot-phase1-e2e-migration-188: Complete Phase 1 SSOT migration #188"
```

#### Step 4: Validation
```bash
# Run critical tests
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category smoke --fast-fail

# Push to remote
git push origin develop-long-lived
```

### PHASE 2: EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH EVALUATION (FUTURE)

**Status: ON HOLD - Requires Business Review**

All Rindhuja branches require:
1. Business case justification
2. Conflict analysis with merged SSOT changes  
3. Explicit approval from tech lead
4. Thorough testing plan

---

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION STRATEGY

### Expected Conflicts
Based on file analysis, potential conflicts in:

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Documentation updates (easy resolution)
2. **netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/user_execution_engine.py** - Core execution logic
3. **WebSocket-related files** - Multiple SSOT consolidation changes
4. **Test files** - SSOT test framework migrations

### Resolution Approach
1. **Favor SSOT patterns** - Always choose the more consolidated approach
2. **Preserve business logic** - Maintain core execution engine functionality  
3. **Documentation merge** - Combine documentation changes logically
4. **Test consolidation** - Use SSOT test framework patterns

### Manual Resolution Process
```bash
# If conflicts occur during merge:
git status                          # Review conflict files
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U  # List unmerged files

# For each conflict file:
# 1. Edit manually, favoring SSOT patterns
# 2. Run relevant tests
# 3. Add resolved file

git add [resolved-file]
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts: favor SSOT patterns"
```

## SAFETY MEASURES & ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### Pre-Merge Safety Checklist
- [ ] Working directory is clean
- [ ] develop-long-lived is up-to-date with remote
- [ ] Critical tests are passing on all branches
- [ ] Backup branch created: `git branch backup-develop-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)`

### Rollback Procedures

#### Immediate Rollback (If Merge Goes Wrong)
```bash
# Reset to state before merge
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Or reset to specific commit
git reset --hard [commit-hash-before-merge]

# Force push if already pushed
git push origin develop-long-lived --force-with-lease
```

#### Emergency Rollback (If Issues Discovered Later)
```bash
# Create recovery branch
git checkout -b emergency-rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Reset develop-long-lived to known good state
git checkout develop-long-lived
git reset --hard [known-good-commit]
git push origin develop-long-lived --force-with-lease
```

### Monitoring & Validation

#### Post-Merge Health Checks
```bash
# Critical test suite
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py
python tests/mission_critical/test_no_ssot_violations.py

# Integration validation  
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category integration --fast-fail

# WebSocket functionality
python tests/e2e/test_websocket_dev_docker_connection.py

# System health
python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py
```

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] All mission-critical tests pass
- [ ] WebSocket events work end-to-end
- [ ] No new SSOT violations introduced
- [ ] System architecture compliance maintained
- [ ] Golden Path user flow functional

**Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM**
- Both branches contain completed, tested SSOT work
- Changes are well-documented and understood
- Business value is clear (Golden Path functionality)
- Rollback procedures are established
- No breaking changes expected

### ❌ NO-GO - EXPERIMENTAL BRANCHES
**Risk Level: HIGH**
- Unclear business justification
- Potential conflicts with SSOT work
- Experimental nature increases uncertainty
- Could destabilize Golden Path functionality
- Lack of proper testing and validation
