# Git Commit Gardener - Cycle 10 Merge Conflict Resolution

## ðŸš¨ FIRST MERGE CONFLICT OF SESSION - 2025-09-12

### Conflict Details
- **File**: pyproject.toml
- **Cause**: Both local and remote modified test markers simultaneously
- **Local Changes**: Added comprehensive business test markers (user_isolation, etc.)
- **Remote Changes**: Added "no_skip" test marker
- **Resolution**: Merge both sets of markers to preserve all functionality

### Local Markers Added:
- agent_execution, business_critical, ssot_delegation, execution_tracking
- critical_type_safety, database, id_system, business_requirements
- user_isolation (our specific addition)

### Remote Markers Added:
- no_skip: Tests that should never be skipped

### Resolution Strategy:
Combine all markers to preserve both development streams' work.

**Justification**: Both sets serve different purposes and both should be retained.
