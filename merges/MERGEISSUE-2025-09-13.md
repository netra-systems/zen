## Potential Conflicts Analysis:
**Issue #757 Overlap:** Both local and remote have Issue #757 Configuration Manager work:
- Local: `7221e3865` - Remove deprecated configuration manager duplication
- Remote: `24e887348`, `210e7b136` - Similar Configuration Manager SSOT work

**Risk Assessment:**
- **HIGH RISK**: Configuration Manager changes may conflict
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Test file changes may overlap
- **LOW RISK**: Documentation updates should merge cleanly

## Merge Strategy:
1. Use `git merge --no-ff` (preferred over rebase as per instructions)
2. Handle conflicts carefully, preserving business value
3. Prioritize Golden Path functionality ($500K+ ARR protection)
4. Validate SSOT compliance after merge

## Justification:
- Both branches contain valuable work that should be preserved
- Configuration Manager SSOT work on both sides needs careful integration
- Golden Path and chat functionality must remain operational
- SSOT principles must be maintained throughout merge

## Safety Measures:
- Document all conflict resolution decisions
- Preserve history and only do minimal actions needed
- Stay on current branch (develop-long-lived)
- Stop if any serious merge problems arise
- Validate system health after merge completion

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION DECISIONS:

### Configuration Manager Conflict Resolution:
- **Conflict:** Remote renamed `unified_configuration_manager.py` to `.removed_757_20250913`, local deleted it
- **Decision:** Choose deletion over rename (local approach)
- **Justification:** Complete removal aligns with SSOT consolidation goals better than preservation with .removed suffix
- **Action:** `git rm netra_backend/app/core/managers/unified_configuration_manager.py.removed_757_20250913`

### Files Successfully Merged:
- 28+ files merged automatically without conflicts
- New Golden Path coverage tests added from remote
- State persistence optimizations integrated
- Docker E2E test improvements included
- GCP log gardener worklog preserved

### Business Value Preserved:
- ✅ SSOT consolidation principles maintained
- ✅ Golden Path functionality preserved
- ✅ $500K+ ARR chat functionality protected
- ✅ Configuration management streamlined

**Merge Status:** SUCCESSFUL with documented conflict resolution
**Date:** 2025-09-13
**Merged commits:** 3 local + 11 remote = 14 total commits integrated
