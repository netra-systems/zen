## Key Principles Applied
1. **Atomic Completeness:** Each commit leaves system in stable state
2. **Logical Grouping:** Related changes grouped by business concept
3. **Business Value Alignment:** Each commit includes BVJ justification  
4. **Reviewability:** Each commit reviewable in under 1 minute
5. **Conceptual Unity:** File count irrelevant; conceptual coherence paramount

## Justification for Grouping Decisions

### Single Commits for Multiple Files
- **Auth System Enhancement (5 files):** Single authentication improvement concept
- **WebSocket Auth Tests (5 files):** Unified test suite for one functionality area
- **Issue #561 Resolution (4 files):** Complete resolution documentation set

### Separate Commits for Related Areas
- **Auth System vs WebSocket Auth Tests:** Different implementation stages
- **Documentation vs Infrastructure:** Different purposes and audiences
- **GCP Dependencies vs Database Scripts:** Different infrastructure layers
