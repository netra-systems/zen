# Git Merge Decision Log - 2025-09-12

**Date:** 2025-09-12 19:40 UTC
**Branch:** develop-long-lived
**Merge Type:** Automatic merge during git pull
**Strategy:** ort (Ostensibly Recursive's Twin)
**Git Commit Gardener Session:** Active

## Merge Summary

**Operation:** `git pull origin develop-long-lived`
**Result:** Successful automatic merge
**Merge Commit:** Created during pull operation
**Files Changed:** 24 files changed, 1407 insertions(+), 37 deletions(-)

## Remote Changes Integrated

### New Files Added:
1. `fix_pytest_skip_collection_errors.py` (215 lines) - Test infrastructure improvement
2. `tests/integration/websocket/test_issue_379_confirmation_gaps_integration.py` (601 lines) - WebSocket integration tests
3. `tests/unit/websocket/test_issue_379_timeout_inadequacy_unit.py` (499 lines) - WebSocket unit tests

### Modified Files:
- Multiple test files with path corrections and minor updates
- Shared lifecycle startup integration updates
- WebSocket test improvements and serialization fixes

## Merge Decision Justification

### Why This Merge Was Safe:
1. **No Conflicts:** Git automatically resolved all changes using 'ort' strategy
2. **Separate Concerns:** Our local commit (test documentation) vs remote changes (test infrastructure)
3. **Non-Overlapping Files:** Local changes to test reports, remote changes to test infrastructure
4. **Repository Health:** No risk to overall repo health, all changes are additive improvements

### Conflict Resolution (None Required):
- **Status:** NO CONFLICTS DETECTED
- **Strategy:** Automatic merge successful
- **Manual Intervention:** None required

### Safety Measures Applied:
1. **Preserved History:** No rebasing, maintained full commit history
2. **Atomic Operations:** Local commits remained intact
3. **Branch Safety:** Stayed on develop-long-lived as instructed
4. **Minimal Actions:** Only pulled necessary changes, no aggressive operations

## Files Modified Summary

### Test Infrastructure (Remote):
- Added pytest collection error fixes
- Enhanced WebSocket testing suite
- Improved test path management
- Added Issue #379 WebSocket timeout/confirmation gap tests

### Test Documentation (Local - Our Changes):
- Updated staging test reports
- Added golden path validation worklog
- Documented WebSocket connectivity issues

## Post-Merge Verification Needed

### Immediate Checks:
- [ ] Verify no test regressions from merge
- [ ] Confirm repository structure intact
- [ ] Push merged changes to origin
- [ ] Validate system health after merge

### Risk Assessment: **LOW**
- Changes are in separate domains (test infra vs test docs)
- No business logic conflicts
- All changes are improvements to testing infrastructure
- No breaking changes detected

## Next Actions

1. Push merged changes to origin
2. Verify repository health
3. Continue Git Commit Gardener process
4. Monitor for any post-merge issues
