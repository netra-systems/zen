# Merge Issue Documentation - 2025-09-15

## Merge Context
- **Branch:** develop-long-lived
- **Operation:** git pull origin develop-long-lived
- **Local commits ahead:** 22
- **Remote commits behind:** 14
- **Conflict Status:** ACTIVE MERGE CONFLICT

## Files with Conflicts
1. `tests/unit/golden_path/test_golden_path_business_value_protection.py` - CONTENT CONFLICT

## Files Auto-Merged Successfully
1. `scripts/deploy_to_gcp_actual.py` - AUTO-MERGED (no conflicts)

## Conflict Analysis

### File: tests/unit/golden_path/test_golden_path_business_value_protection.py
- **Conflict Type:** Content conflict in `_simulate_execution_logging` method
- **Issue:** Both local and remote have changes to the same method implementation
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM (test file, not production code)
- **Business Impact:** LOW (affects test infrastructure only)

#### Detailed Conflict Analysis:
1. **Lines 329-336**: Method signature and implementation differ
   - LOCAL (HEAD): `_simulate_execution_logging(correlation_id, 'mixed', mock_core, mock_tracker)`
   - REMOTE: `_simulate_execution_logging(correlation_id, 'mixed')` with instance variable tracking

2. **Lines 356-363**: Method signature and implementation differ
   - LOCAL (HEAD): `_simulate_execution_logging(correlation_id, 'unified', mock_core, mock_tracker)`
   - REMOTE: `_simulate_execution_logging(correlation_id, 'unified')` with instance variable tracking

3. **Lines 433-501**: Complete method reimplementation
   - LOCAL (HEAD): Uses mock objects passed as parameters
   - REMOTE: Uses internal `_track_log` method and instance variables for better testing isolation

#### RESOLUTION CHOICE: REMOTE VERSION
**Justification:**
- Remote version has better test isolation using instance variables
- Remote version has dedicated `_track_log` helper method for consistency
- Remote version separates concerns better (tracking vs mocking)
- Remote version appears more complete and robust for correlation testing
- Local version has parameter dependencies that may be harder to maintain
- Remote version follows better testing patterns for state management

## Resolution Strategy
1. Examine the conflicted file to understand the nature of conflicts
2. Preserve both sets of changes if they don't conflict logically
3. Choose the most comprehensive/recent changes if they do conflict
4. Ensure SSOT compliance and golden path business value protection
5. Document all resolution choices with justification

## Safety Checks Applied
- ✅ Staying on develop-long-lived branch
- ✅ No rebase operations
- ✅ Documenting all merge decisions
- ✅ Working tree was clean before merge
- ✅ Merge conflicts contained to test infrastructure

## Resolution Actions Completed
1. ✅ Examined conflicted file content - `_simulate_execution_logging` method conflicts identified
2. ✅ Resolved conflicts with justification - REMOTE version chosen for better test isolation
3. ✅ Validated resolution - No remaining conflict markers
4. ⏳ Complete merge commit - IN PROGRESS
5. ⏳ Push safely to remote - PENDING

## Merge Resolution Summary
- **File:** `tests/unit/golden_path/test_golden_path_business_value_protection.py`
- **Resolution:** REMOTE version of `_simulate_execution_logging` method adopted
- **Key Changes:**
  - Method signature: `(correlation_id, scenario)` instead of `(correlation_id, scenario, mock_core, mock_tracker)`
  - Added `_track_log` helper method for better test state management
  - Improved test isolation using instance variables
- **Risk Assessment:** LOW - Test infrastructure change only, maintains business logic
