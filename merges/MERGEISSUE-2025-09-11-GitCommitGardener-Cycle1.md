- `COMPREHENSIVE_INFRASTRUCTURE_CONNECTIVITY_TEST_PLAN.md`
- `HOLISTIC_INFRASTRUCTURE_CONNECTIVITY_TEST_EXECUTION_REPORT.md`
- `docs/UNIFIED_INFRASTRUCTURE_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`

**Justification:** Documentation belongs together as single logical unit
**Concept:** Documentation for infrastructure remediation work

#### Commit 3: Infrastructure Test Suite
**Files:**
- `test_auth_connectivity_simple.py`
- `tests/e2e/test_golden_path_auth_e2e.py`
- `tests/integration/test_auth_service_integration.py` 
- `tests/unit/test_auth_service_connectivity_unit.py`

**Justification:** Test suite as atomic unit for infrastructure validation
**Concept:** Comprehensive testing for infrastructure remediation

#### Commit 4: WebSocket Auth Integration
**Files:**
- `netra_backend/app/websocket_core/unified_websocket_auth.py`

**Justification:** Integration of remediation components into existing WebSocket auth
**Concept:** Integration layer connecting infrastructure work to existing systems
