# Git Commit Gardener Merge Decision Log - CRITICAL MERGE REQUIRED

**Date:** 2025-09-10 13:37:00
**Branch:** develop-long-lived
**Gardener Session:** Merge Conflict Resolution

## CRITICAL SITUATION

**Push Rejected:** Remote contains work not present locally
**Conflict Type:** Remote ahead by 1 merge commit bringing Redis SSOT work
**Local Status:** Have critical SSOT remediation fixes that must be preserved

## Remote Analysis

**New Remote Commits:**
- `4b3a48f23` - Merge commit (someone merged Redis SSOT work)
- `a3eb34d21` - Redis import pattern migration plan and tests

**Local Commits to Preserve:**
- `6c1df7a78` - Critical SSOT remediation across core execution infrastructure

## Merge Strategy Decision

**CHOICE: GIT MERGE** (Following critical rule: prefer merge over rebase)

**Reasoning:**
- Both local and remote commits are SSOT-related and complementary
- Local: Core execution engine SSOT fixes 
- Remote: Redis import pattern SSOT work
- No conflicting concepts - both advance same business goal
- Merge preserves complete history and avoids rebase dangers

## Safety Assessment

**Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM
- Both sides working on SSOT consolidation 
- Different component areas (execution engines vs Redis imports)
- Same ultimate goal (SSOT compliance)
- Test suites exist for validation

## Merge Execution Plan

1. `git pull origin develop-long-lived` (creates merge commit)
2. Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur
3. Validate system still works
4. Push merged result

**BVJ for Merge:**
- **Segment:** Platform
- **Goal:** Stability 
- **Impact:** Combines execution engine SSOT fixes with Redis SSOT work
- **Revenue Impact:** Protects $500K+ ARR with comprehensive SSOT compliance
