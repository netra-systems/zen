# Merge Issue Resolution - 2025-09-10 16:18:06

**Issue Type:** Invalid file path during merge  
**Branch:** develop-long-lived  
**Process:** Git Gardener Iteration #3, Step 0b  

## Problem
During `git pull`, encountered merge failure:
```
error: invalid path 'merges/MERGEISSUE:2025-09-10-15:22.md'
Merge with strategy ort failed.
```

## Analysis
- **Root Cause:** File path contains colons (:) which are invalid on Windows file systems
- **Source:** Remote branch has a file with colons in the filename
- **Impact:** Prevents merge completion and repository synchronization

## Resolution Strategy
1. **SAFETY FIRST:** Document issue before any merge resolution attempts
2. **Investigate:** Check remote branch for the problematic file
3. **Resolution:** Use appropriate git commands to handle the file path issue
4. **Verification:** Ensure merge completes successfully without breaking git history

## Safety Protocol Compliance
- âœ… Stayed on develop-long-lived branch
- âœ… Documented merge issue immediately
- âœ… No force operations attempted
- âœ… Git history preservation prioritized

## Detailed Investigation Results

### File Path Issues
- `merges/MERGEISSUE:2025-09-10-15:22.md` - Invalid colon in filename (Windows incompatible)
- `merges/MERGEISSUE:20250910.md` - Invalid colon in filename (Windows incompatible)

### Repository State Issues
- **Branch Divergence:** Local has 41 commits, remote has 18 different commits
- **Untracked Files:** 40+ untracked files in working directory would be overwritten
- **File Types:** Mix of backup files (.backup_pre_factory_migration), documentation, and scripts

### Critical Decision Point
This represents a SERIOUS repository state issue that goes beyond simple merge conflicts:
1. **Windows/Linux incompatibility** due to colon characters in filenames
2. **Massive working directory pollution** with untracked files
3. **Significant branch divergence** indicating possible parallel development

## Safety Protocol Assessment
ðŸš¨ **STOP CONDITION REACHED**

This situation requires manual intervention and is beyond the scope of automated gardening:
- Repository safety is at risk
- Automated merge resolution could cause data loss
- Working directory state is unclear

## Recommendations
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Document current state completely
2. **MANUAL REVIEW:** Human review of branch divergence required
3. **CLEANUP:** Working directory needs manual cleanup before merge
4. **COMPATIBILITY:** Remote files with colons need renaming on source

**Decision Log:** STOPPING automated process. Human intervention required for repository safety.
