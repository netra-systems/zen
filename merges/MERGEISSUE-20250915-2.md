## Conflict Analysis

### File: websocket_manager_factory.py
- **Conflict Type:** Modify/Delete conflict
- **Issue:** File deleted locally as part of legacy cleanup, but modified remotely
- **Context:** Remote appears to have made fixes while we removed legacy code
- **Business Impact:** LOW (WebSocket factory deprecation vs remote fixes)

## Resolution Strategy
1. ✅ Examined remote version - 1000+ lines of enterprise resource management
2. ✅ Analyzed business impact - Contains revenue protection and enterprise user priority
3. ✅ DECISION: PRESERVE REMOTE VERSION
4. ✅ Justification: Critical enterprise features not replicated in current SSOT patterns
5. ✅ Business Impact: Revenue protection ($500K+ ARR) and resource exhaustion recovery

## RESOLUTION DECISION: PRESERVE REMOTE VERSION

### Business Justification:
- **Enterprise Features:** 20-manager limits, graduated cleanup, zombie detection
- **Revenue Protection:** Enterprise user priority during resource exhaustion
- **Business Value:** Protects $500K+ ARR customers during high load
- **Resource Management:** Comprehensive health monitoring and automatic recovery
- **Golden Path Protection:** Maintains chat functionality under extreme load

### Technical Justification:
- Remote version has substantial new functionality (1000+ lines)
- Contains mission-critical business protection features
- Enterprise-grade resource management not present in current SSOT
- Health monitoring and graduated cleanup strategies are valuable
- Automatic recovery mechanisms prevent system failure

### Risk Assessment:
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM - Reintroducing file we deleted
- **Mitigation:** File appears well-documented and follows SSOT patterns
- **Business Risk:** HIGH if we lose enterprise protection features
- **Technical Debt:** ACCEPTABLE - Well-structured enterprise code
