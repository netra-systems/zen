# Git Commit Gardener Merge Decision Log

**Date:** 2025-09-10 13:33:00
**Branch:** develop-long-lived
**Gardener Session:** Cycle 2 - Ongoing SSOT Work

## Change Analysis Summary

**Total Changes:** 
- 2 modified files (execution engine consolidation + OAuth test refinement)
- 1 new E2E test file (Golden Path execution tests)
- 1 new documentation file (Service ID SSOT test plan summary)
- All changes continuing the SSOT consolidation theme

## Logical Grouping Decision

Following SPEC/git_commit_atomic_units.xml, these changes represent **ONE COHESIVE CONCEPT**:

**"SSOT Execution Engine Consolidation Implementation Phase"**

### Reasoning (Per Spec Guidelines):
- **Single Concept:** All files implement execution engine SSOT consolidation
- **Dependency Chain:** E2E tests validate the consolidated execution engine
- **Feature Coherence:** Complete implementation of execution engine consolidation with testing
- **Test Coupling:** Implementation must be committed with validation tests

### Files Analysis:
1. **Core Implementation:** `execution_engine_consolidated.py` (89 new lines)
2. **E2E Validation:** `test_golden_path_execution.py` (32,659 bytes comprehensive test)
3. **OAuth Test Refinement:** Minor test improvement (4 lines)
4. **Documentation:** Service ID SSOT test plan summary

### Spec Compliance Check:
- ✅ **Atomic Completeness:** Complete consolidated execution engine with tests
- ✅ **Logical Grouping:** All serve execution engine SSOT consolidation goal
- ✅ **Business Value Alignment:** Prevents execution engine fragmentation
- ✅ **Concept Over File Count:** Single concept across multiple files
- ✅ **Reviewability:** "Consolidated execution engine implementation with E2E validation"

## Commit Strategy Decision

**SINGLE COMMIT** - All changes represent the implementation phase of execution engine SSOT consolidation.

**BVJ (Business Value Justification):**
- **Segment:** Platform
- **Goal:** Stability + Performance 
- **Impact:** Eliminates execution engine fragmentation, ensures consistent agent processing
- **Revenue Impact:** Protects Golden Path reliability for $500K+ ARR chat functionality

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM - Core execution engine changes, but with comprehensive E2E tests

## Alternative Considered

**REJECTED:** Separating implementation from tests
**Reason:** Violates dependency chain principle - consolidated engine needs its validation tests
