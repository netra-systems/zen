- **Time:** 16:45:54 UTC
- **Type:** Automatic merge using 'ort' strategy

## Pre-Merge State
- Local commits ahead: 7 commits
- Remote commits behind: 4 commits

## Files Modified in Merge
### Auto-merged files (no conflicts):
1. `netra_backend/app/startup_module.py` - Added central_logger import
2. `netra_backend/app/websocket_core/unified_emitter.py` - Added central_logger import

### Files Added from Remote:
- Multiple central logger import fix files and reports
- 38 files received missing central_logger imports
- Documentation and fix scripts for issue #1304

## Merge Justification
**Decision:** Accepted automatic merge using 'ort' strategy
**Reasoning:**
1. The changes were non-conflicting - adding missing imports to files
2. The central_logger imports are critical for staging environment logging
3. No functional code changes, only import additions
4. Automatic merge correctly integrated both sets of changes

## Verification
- Merge completed successfully
- No manual intervention required
- All files properly integrated
