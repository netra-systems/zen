- **Latest Commit:** `52ac0f46b` - fix: ensure WebSocketNotifier validation and improve E2E test mock setup
- **Status:** Up to date with origin/develop-long-lived
- **Health:** EXCELLENT - All SSOT compliance validation complete

#### Branch Merge Analysis

**1. feature/ssot-workflow-orchestrator-remediation**
- **Merge Base:** `d42cef064` (already at common ancestor)
- **Status:** NO MERGE NEEDED - Already synchronized
- **Reason:** Branch is at merge base with main, no unique commits to merge

**2. fix/llm-manager-factory-pattern-issue-224**  
- **Merge Base:** Same as feature branch via PR #237
- **Status:** NO MERGE NEEDED - Already integrated via pull requests
- **Reason:** Changes already merged through PR workflow

**3. ssot-unified-test-runner-remediation**
- **Status:** NO MERGE NEEDED - All commits already in develop-long-lived
- **Reason:** All SSOT test runner remediation work integrated

**4. redis-ssot-phase1a-issue-226**
- **Status:** ALREADY MERGED - Integrated in Iteration 8
- **Documentation:** Redis SSOT Phase 1A completed successfully

### FINAL MERGE DECISION: NO MERGES REQUIRED

**RATIONALE:**
1. All feature branches are either at common ancestors or already merged
2. develop-long-lived contains the most recent and complete work
3. All SSOT remediation work has been successfully integrated
4. System is in optimal state for final completion
