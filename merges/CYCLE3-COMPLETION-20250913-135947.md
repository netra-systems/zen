**Mission:** Complete staged commits and push safely to origin

## CYCLE 3 EXECUTION SUMMARY

### âœ… SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED

   - **Business Value:** Platform stability through improved test infrastructure
   - **Files Modified:** `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_event_delivery_failures.py`

2. **Async Context Creation Fix**
   - **Commit:** `50382ef4b` - "fix(tests): Add missing await for async create_isolated_execution_context"
   - **Changes:** Added missing `await` for async execution context creation
   - **Business Value:** Platform stability through proper async testing patterns
   - **Files Modified:** Related to execution context testing

- **Issue #449 Coverage:** Comprehensive middleware conflict tests already in place
- **Test Framework:** Improved execution context isolation for multi-user scenarios

### Development Velocity
- **Clean Repository:** All ahead commits pushed successfully
- **No Blocking Issues:** Repository in clean, deployable state
- **Safety First:** All operations followed non-destructive protocols

## CYCLE 3 DELIVERABLES âœ…

1. âœ… **Staged Commit Completion:** WebSocket event delivery test enhancements committed
2. âœ… **Issue #449 Verification:** FastAPI middleware test confirmed already committed
3. âœ… **Safe Push Operation:** All ahead commits pushed to origin successfully
4. âœ… **Repository Synchronization:** Clean working tree, up-to-date with origin
5. âœ… **Documentation:** Complete record of all operations and decisions

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions
- No immediate actions required
- Repository is in stable, deployable state
