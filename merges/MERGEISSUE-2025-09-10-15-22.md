# Git Merge Issue Documentation

**Date:** 2025-09-10 15:22
**Commit:** Cycles 5-6 (2 commits requiring remote sync)
**Branch:** develop-long-lived

## Merge Situation

**Local State:**
- 2 new commits ready to push:
  1. `f5c3f9980` - "test: add comprehensive WebSocket SSOT compliance and security test suite" (6 files, 3,091 lines)
  2. `74de41176` - "test: update test infrastructure and WebSocket client improvements" (2 files, 7 lines)

**Remote State:**
- Remote branch moved ahead: `6c8f9b582..80125b2ea`
- Need to pull remote changes before pushing

## Merge Strategy Decision

**Chosen Approach:** Git Pull (Merge)
- **Reasoning:** Following process instructions to prefer merge over rebase
- **Safety:** Both local commits are complete test additions/improvements, low conflict risk
- **Content:** Our changes are isolated test files, remote changes likely on different areas

## Merge Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** LOW
- **Local Changes:** Primarily new test files in isolated directories
- **Change Type:** Test infrastructure additions and improvements
- **Conflict Probability:** Very low (new files + test report updates)

## Merge Execution Plan

1. Execute `git pull` to merge remote changes
2. Resolve any conflicts if they occur (expect none)
3. Push merged result
4. Verify all 5 total commits are in remote history

## Justification

Following CLAUDE.md process requirements:
- Prefer git merge over rebase ✓
- Document merge choices and justification ✓  
- Preserve history and minimal actions ✓
- Repository safety first ✓

## Expected Outcome

Clean merge with all commits preserved:
- Previous commits: Cycles 1, 3, 4 (3 commits) ✓
- New commits: Cycles 5-6 (2 commits) pending
- Total expected: 5 git commit gardener commits
