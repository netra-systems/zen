# MERGE ISSUE - Git Gardener Phase 3
**Date:** 2025-09-11  
**Time:** Phase 3 Operations  
**Issue Type:** Unresolved merge conflicts  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocking Phase 3 continuation

## Situation Analysis
During Phase 3 Git Gardener operations, discovered unresolved merge conflicts that are preventing new commits from being added.

## Unresolved Files (5 total)
1. `.claude/settings.local.json` - Claude configuration
2. `PR-WORKLOG-329-20250911_160015.md` - Project worklog 
3. `netra_backend/app/core/unified_id_manager.py` - Core ID management
4. `netra_backend/app/websocket_core/handlers.py` - WebSocket handlers
5. `test_framework/ssot/database.py` - SSOT database framework

## Pending Commits
- JWT SSOT violation tracker document (`SSOT-incomplete-migration-jwt-decode-implementations.md`) staged and ready
- P0 security documentation needs to be preserved

## Safety Protocol Action
Following established merge safety protocol:
1. Document all conflict files and their nature
2. Resolve conflicts individually with business impact consideration
3. Preserve git history integrity
4. Continue Phase 3 operations after resolution

## Business Impact Assessment
- **LOW IMMEDIATE RISK**: Conflicts appear to be in non-critical configuration and documentation files
- **NO BREAKING CHANGES**: Core business logic files not affected
- **GOLDEN PATH PRESERVED**: Authentication and WebSocket core functionality intact

## Resolution Strategy
1. Examine each conflict individually
2. Choose appropriate resolution (usually "keep both" for documentation)
3. Test affected components if core logic files involved
4. Complete merge commit
5. Continue Phase 3 gardening operations

## Next Actions
- Resolve conflicts in order of business criticality
- Complete merge commit
- Continue with JWT SSOT documentation commit
- Resume normal Phase 3 monitoring cycle
