## VALIDATION RESULTS

### Critical Tests Status
**Mission Critical WebSocket Tests:** ‚ùå EXPECTED FAILURE - Docker not available  
- Tests require Docker services which are not running in this environment
- This is expected and does not indicate merge issues

### Smoke Tests Status  
**Unified Test Runner:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL FAILURE - Expected without Docker
- Syntax validation: ‚úÖ PASSED (4591 files checked)
- Test structure: ‚úÖ PASSED  
- Service tests: ‚ùå FAILED (Docker required)

### System Health Check ‚úÖ
- [x] **Branch Status:** Successfully on develop-long-lived
- [x] **Remote Push:** Changes successfully pushed to origin
- [x] **Commit History:** All commits preserved with proper merge structure
- [x] **File Integrity:** All critical files merged without data loss
