**Date:** 2025-09-16  
**Time:** 01:32 UTC  
**Branch:** develop-long-lived  
**Gardener Session:** 1 of 3 (max)

## Merge Situation Analysis

### Pre-Merge Status
- **Current Branch:** develop-long-lived
- **Local Position:** 1 commit ahead of origin/develop-long-lived
- **Working Tree:** Clean
- **Local Commit:** bb28a3485 - "docs: add GCP staging deployment troubleshooting analysis"

### Remote Branch Status
- **Remote HEAD:** 0b8812c90 - "a"  
- **Relationship:** Linear history, no divergence
- **Conflict Risk:** NONE (we're adding new files only)

### Merge Decision Rationale

**NO MERGE CONFLICTS DETECTED:**
- We are ahead by exactly 1 commit with new files only
- No existing files were modified in our commit
- Remote branch has not advanced since our base commit
- Linear history maintained

**ACTIONS TAKEN:**
- ✅ Created atomic commit following SPEC/git_commit_atomic_units.xml
- ✅ Verified clean working tree state
- ✅ Confirmed linear history (no complex merges needed)
- ✅ Prepared for safe push operation

**MERGE STRATEGY:** 
- **Chosen:** Fast-forward (no explicit merge needed)
- **Justification:** We are ahead with linear history, no conflicts possible
- **Alternative Considered:** 3-way merge (unnecessary - no divergence)
- **Safety Level:** HIGH - adding documentation files only
