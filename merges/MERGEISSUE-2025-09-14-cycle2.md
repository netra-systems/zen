### Merge Decision Justifications

#### Why Stash-Merge-Pop Strategy
- **Safety First:** Avoids complex manual conflict resolution
- **Preservation:** Maintains all local development work
- **Clean History:** Results in clean merge commit without conflict markers
- **Standard Practice:** Well-established git workflow for diverged branches

#### Risk Assessment
- **LOW RISK:** No complex conflicts encountered
- **VALIDATED:** All remote changes appear to be standard SSOT documentation updates
- **BUSINESS SAFE:** No critical code changes in merged files

## Post-Merge Status
- **Branch Status:** 6 commits ahead of remote (local commits preserved + new merge)
- **Working Directory:** Clean merge with local changes properly reapplied
- **Next Steps:** Continue systematic commit gardening of local changes

## Merge Commit Details
