## Merge Decision Process
**Date/Time:** 2025-09-12
**Context:** Git commit gardener process handling merge conflicts safely

### Pre-Merge Analysis
- Remote fetch completed successfully
- No obvious remote commits showing in log comparison
- Attempting safe merge with git pull strategy

### Actions Taken
1. Created this log file to track all merge decisions
2. About to execute: git pull origin develop-long-lived
3. Will use merge strategy (not rebase) for safety per instructions

### Merge Strategy Justification
- Using merge over rebase as per safety instructions
- Will preserve all commit history 
- Any conflicts will be resolved manually with full documentation

## Merge Execution Log

### Merge Outcome: SUCCESS - NO CONFLICTS
- **Result:** "Already up to date" - no actual merge needed
- **Analysis:** The push rejection appears to have been a temporary synchronization issue
- **Action:** No merge conflicts to resolve
- **Next Step:** Retry push operation

### Lessons Learned
