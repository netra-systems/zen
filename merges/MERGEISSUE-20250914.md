# Git Merge Strategy Document - 2025-09-14

## Merge Situation Analysis

**Branch Status:** develop-long-lived has diverged
- Local commits: 2 commits ahead
- Remote commits: 9 commits behind
- Current branch: develop-long-lived

## Remote Changes Analysis
Recent remote commits focus on:
- SSOT (Single Source of Truth) consolidation work
- WebSocket manager improvements and cleanup
- Test discovery and planning improvements
- Documentation updates for WebSocket patterns
- Import registry updates

## Local Changes Analysis
- **Modified File:** `scripts/claude-instance-orchestrator.py`
  - Added 2 new InstanceConfig entries for ssotgardener commands
  - Changes: `/ssotgardener websockets or auth` and `/ssotgardener tests`
  - These appear to be legitimate development additions

- **Untracked Files:**
  - Various analysis and documentation files
  - New integration test file
  - JWT secret generation script

## Merge Strategy Decision

**Approach:** Safe merge using `git pull` with merge commit
**Justification:**
1. Both local and remote changes appear to be legitimate development work
2. Local changes to orchestrator are additive and unlikely to conflict
3. Remote SSOT work is complementary to local orchestrator improvements
4. Merge commit preserves full history and context

## Merge Execution Plan

1. Stage current local changes first
2. Pull remote changes with merge strategy
3. Handle any conflicts if they arise
4. Verify merge integrity
5. Organize and commit untracked files in logical units

## Risk Assessment: LOW
- No overlapping file modifications detected
- Both sets of changes appear complementary
- All changes align with project's SSOT and testing initiatives
