# Merge Resolution Log

**Date:** 2025-09-15 22:58:21
**Branch:** develop-long-lived
**Operation:** Safe merge from origin/develop-long-lived
**Result:** SUCCESS

## Situation Analysis

**Initial State:**
- Local branch: develop-long-lived (19 commits ahead)
- Remote branch: origin/develop-long-lived (79 commits ahead)
- Status: Diverged branches requiring merge

**Conflict Details:**
- **File:** `temp_issue_body.md`
- **Type:** Content conflict between local closure and remote investigation details
- **Severity:** Minor - documentation conflict only

## Resolution Strategy

**Approach Used:** git merge (NOT rebase) to preserve history
**Resolution Method:** Manual conflict resolution preserving both perspectives

### Conflict Resolution Details

**File:** `temp_issue_body.md`
**Local Version (HEAD):** Issue marked as closed with "no further action required"
**Remote Version:** Detailed investigation requirements and technical context

**Resolution Decision:**
- Preserved local closure status (issue is resolved)
- Converted remote investigation details to "Historical Investigation Details"
- Marked all acceptance criteria as completed
- Added resolution summary showing completed actions

**Justification:**
- Local state indicates issue has been resolved
- Remote investigation details provide valuable historical context
- Combined approach preserves both resolution status and technical context
- No information loss, maintains audit trail

## Safety Verification
