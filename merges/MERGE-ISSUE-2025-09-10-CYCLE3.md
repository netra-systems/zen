# Git Merge Issue Documentation - CYCLE 3 - 2025-09-10

## Overview - Emergency Merge Conflict During Git Gardener Process
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Process:** Git Commit Gardener CYCLE 3 - Unexpected merge conflict
**Branch:** develop-long-lived  
**Conflict Files:**
- `STAGING_TEST_REPORT_PYTEST.md`
- `netra_backend/tests/unit/golden_path/test_agent_result_validation_business_logic.py`

## Situation Assessment
- **Context**: During CYCLE 3 atomic commit process, merge conflict appeared
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Conflicts are in test/documentation files, not core business logic
- **Safety Status**: Repository history preserved, working directory has unmerged paths

## Conflict Analysis

### File 1: STAGING_TEST_REPORT_PYTEST.md
**Nature:** Documentation conflict - both sides likely updating test reports
**Risk:** LOW - Documentation file, no business logic impact

### File 2: test_agent_result_validation_business_logic.py  
**Nature:** Test file conflict - likely test improvements from both sides
**Risk:** MEDIUM - Business logic test file, need to preserve test coverage

## Resolution Strategy
**DECISION: Resolve conflicts preserving both sides' improvements**

### Safety Considerations:
- ✅ **Repository Safety**: No core business logic conflicts
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Preserve test functionality from both sides  
- ✅ **Documentation**: Merge documentation improvements
- ✅ **Git Gardener Continuity**: Resume CYCLE 3 after resolution

## Next Actions:
1. Examine conflicts in detail
2. Resolve preserving valuable changes from both sides
3. Test conflict resolution
4. Continue CYCLE 3 atomic commits
5. Document resolution outcomes
