# MERGE DECISION LOG - CYCLE 11
**Date:** 2025-09-09 16:08:14
**Branch:** critical-remediation-20250823  
**Cycle:** 11
**Agent:** Git Commit Gardener

## SITUATION
- Local branch has 1 new commit ahead of remote: `1499f1a96` (staging test report timestamp update)
- Remote has ~30 new commits that were pushed by other developers/processes
- Divergent branches requiring merge decision

## REMOTE CHANGES ANALYSIS
Remote includes significant testing infrastructure additions:
- Comprehensive race condition test suites
- WebSocket lifecycle and state machine tests  
- Agent execution authorization and result delivery validation
- Multi-user state machine isolation integration tests
- GCP timing tests and performance analysis
- Authentication flow enhancements

## MERGE STRATEGY DECISION
**CHOSEN:** git pull --rebase origin critical-remediation-20250823

**RATIONALE:**
1. Local change is minimal (just timestamp update in documentation)
2. Remote changes are substantial testing infrastructure (mission critical)
3. Rebase will cleanly apply our small change on top of the comprehensive test suite
4. No conceptual conflicts expected between timestamp update and test infrastructure
5. Maintains clean linear history for the gardener process

## RISK ASSESSMENT
- **LOW RISK**: Documentation timestamp change unlikely to conflict with test code
- **HIGH VALUE**: Remote changes contain critical race condition and WebSocket tests
- **BUSINESS ALIGNMENT**: All changes support platform stability (CLAUDE.md compliance)

## EXECUTION PLAN
1. Execute git pull --rebase
2. Verify no conflicts on simple documentation change
3. Test that rebase completed successfully
4. Push the rebased commits
5. Verify final state

## FALLBACK
If rebase fails due to unexpected conflicts:
- Abort rebase: `git rebase --abort`  
- Switch to merge strategy: `git pull --no-rebase`
- Document any conflicts in follow-up log
