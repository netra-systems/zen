# Merge Resolution Documentation

**Date:** 2025-09-13 20:29:00 UTC
**Type:** Remote branch merge (develop-long-lived)
**Agent:** Git Commit Gardener
**Compliance:** SPEC/git_commit_atomic_units.xml

## Merge Situation

### Local Commits (4 commits ahead):
- `ad0cbea4e` - feat(ssot): Complete Step 1 DatabaseManager test discovery and planning
- `da12e90c1` - refactor(tests): Fix DeepAgentState import path to follow SSOT patterns
- `3dd1700de` - feat: Update SSOT agents issue #917 with critical findings
- `d46a5dde4` - docs(tests): Achieve 100% pass rate in staging environment testing

### Remote Commits (12+ commits ahead):
- `97f01a00f` - docs: Update SSOT Configuration Manager progress
- `5c87ecb8b` - test(auth): Add comprehensive auth service initialization tests
- `ad302c4c3` - feat: Create comprehensive SSOT validation tests for Issue #929
- `7557b78d4` - fix(imports): Migrate DeepAgentState imports (DUPLICATE WORK)
- Multiple merge commits and development activities

### Overlap Analysis

**DUPLICATE WORK DETECTED:**
1. **DeepAgentState Import Migration:**
   - Our: `da12e90c1` - "Fix DeepAgentState import path to follow SSOT patterns"
   - Remote: `7557b78d4` - "Migrate DeepAgentState imports from agents.state to schemas.agent_models"
   - **RESOLUTION:** Accept remote version as authoritative, our local changes may conflict

2. **Test Infrastructure Updates:**
   - Both branches have extensive test file modifications
   - Potential conflicts in test framework imports and patterns

## Pre-Merge Assessment

### Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Extensive file modifications on both sides
- 200+ test files modified locally from continuous development
- DeepAgentState import conflicts expected

### Strategy: MERGE (Not Rebase)
Following SPEC requirements:
- Use git merge to preserve commit history
- Document all conflict resolutions
- No destructive operations

## Merge Execution

### Step 1: Pull and Merge
```bash
git pull origin develop-long-lived --no-rebase
```

### Step 2: Conflict Resolution Strategy

**For DeepAgentState Conflicts:**
- ACCEPT: Remote version (schemas.agent_models import)
- REASON: Remote appears to be more comprehensive migration

**For Test File Conflicts:**
- EVALUATE: Each conflict individually
- PRESERVE: Local test improvements where possible
- ALIGN: With SSOT patterns from remote

**For Documentation Conflicts:**
- MERGE: Content from both sides where compatible
- PRESERVE: All tracking and worklog information

### Step 3: Validation
- Run mission critical tests post-merge
- Verify no SSOT compliance regressions
- Confirm WebSocket events still functional

## Expected Conflicts

1. **DeepAgentState imports** - Accept remote
2. **Test file modifications** - Case-by-case evaluation
3. **Documentation updates** - Merge compatible content
4. **Configuration changes** - Preserve both approaches

## Business Impact

**PROTECTED:**
- All local commits represent active development work
- SSOT compliance improvements preserved
- Test infrastructure enhancements maintained

**AT RISK:**
- Potential test collection conflicts
- Import path consistency issues
- Continuous development workflow interruption

## Merge Decision Log

All merge decisions will be documented here during execution with full justification for each resolution choice.
