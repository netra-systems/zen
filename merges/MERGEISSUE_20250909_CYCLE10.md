## Status Assessment
This conflict was NOT present at the start of CYCLE 10. This suggests either:
1. The conflict emerged during the gardener process
2. Background processes modified the repository 
3. The conflict was masked and became visible during commit attempt

## Safety Actions Taken
1. **STOP COMMIT OPERATIONS** - No further commits until conflict resolved
2. **LOG ISSUE** - This report documents the conflict for tracking
3. **PRESERVE WORK** - Current staged changes preserved
4. **ALERT PROTOCOL** - Issue flagged for immediate attention

## Recommended Resolution
1. Resolve the merge conflict in the test file
