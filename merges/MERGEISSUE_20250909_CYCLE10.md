# MERGE ISSUE DETECTED - CYCLE 10
**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Time:** During CYCLE 10 commit operations  
**Branch:** critical-remediation-20250823  
**Issue:** Unresolved merge conflict detected  

## Conflict Details
**Unmerged Files:**
- `netra_backend/tests/unit/agents/test_agent_execution_orchestration_comprehensive.py`

**Error Message:**
```
error: Committing is not possible because you have unmerged files.
hint: Fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm <file>'
hint: as appropriate to mark resolution and make a commit.
fatal: Exiting because of an unresolved conflict.
```

## Status Assessment
This conflict was NOT present at the start of CYCLE 10. This suggests either:
1. The conflict emerged during the gardener process
2. Background processes modified the repository 
3. The conflict was masked and became visible during commit attempt

## Safety Actions Taken
1. **STOP COMMIT OPERATIONS** - No further commits until conflict resolved
2. **LOG ISSUE** - This report documents the conflict for tracking
3. **PRESERVE WORK** - Current staged changes preserved
4. **ALERT PROTOCOL** - Issue flagged for immediate attention

## Current Repository State
**Staged Changes:**
- .coveragerc (coverage configuration)
- config/test_config_unified.ini (unified test config)

**Unstaged Changes:**
- netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/agent_execution_core.py (WebSocket enhancements)

**Untracked Files:**
- tests/integration/test_database_connection_pooling_performance.py (performance test)

**Conflict Status:**
- ‚ùå UNRESOLVED MERGE CONFLICT in test file

## Recommended Resolution
1. Resolve the merge conflict in the test file
2. Resume commit operations only after conflict resolution
3. Re-run git status to verify clean state
4. Continue with CYCLE 10 atomic commits

## Impact Assessment
- **Repository Safety:** PROTECTED - No commits made during conflict
- **Work Progress:** PRESERVED - All changes are staged/available
- **Gardener Process:** PAUSED - Awaiting conflict resolution

**Next Action:** Manual conflict resolution required before continuing CYCLE 10
