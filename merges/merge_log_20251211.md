# Git Commit Gardener - Merge Log
**Date**: 2025-12-11
**Branch**: develop-long-lived
**Agent**: Git Commit Gardener

## Situation Analysis
- Branch is 2 commits behind origin/develop-long-lived
- Modified files causing conflict during pull
- Changes include test reports, prerequisites validator, and test orchestration improvements

## Merge Conflict Details
**Conflicting File**: `STAGING_TEST_REPORT_PYTEST.md`
- **Cause**: Both local and origin have modified this test report
- **Local changes**: Updated test results with 7 tests, 6 passed, 1 failed (85.7% pass rate)
- **Origin changes**: Unknown - need investigation

## Resolution Strategy
1. **Examine origin version** to understand their changes
2. **Compare conflicting content** to identify actual differences
3. **Preserve meaningful test data** from both versions if valuable
4. **Choose MERGE over rebase** (safer approach as per instructions)
5. **Document all decisions** for transparency

## Safety Measures
- Using git merge (not rebase) for safety
- Preserving both local and origin work where possible
- Full documentation of all decisions
- Staying on develop-long-lived branch throughout

## Next Actions
- Check origin version of conflicting file
- Resolve conflicts preserving maximum value
- Continue with atomic commit grouping
