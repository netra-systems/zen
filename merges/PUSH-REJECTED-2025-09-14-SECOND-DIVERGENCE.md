# Push Rejected - Second Divergence 2025-09-14

## Situation
**Time**: Post-merge completion  
**Issue**: Remote has moved again while resolving first merge  
**Status**: Need second merge operation  

## Analysis
After successfully completing merge of 190 remote commits and resolving conflicts, the remote branch has received additional commits during our merge resolution process.

## Current State  
- **Local**: 14 commits ahead (12 original + 1 merge commit + 1 documentation commit)
- **Remote**: New commits added during our merge process
- **Action Required**: Safe pull to integrate latest changes

## Safety Assessment
**Risk Level**: LOW
- All local work is committed and documented
- Merge documentation preserved
- No conflicts expected (different timing)

## Execution Plan
1. Execute `git pull` to get latest remote changes
2. Resolve any new conflicts (unlikely)  
3. Push integrated result
4. Document outcome

## Business Impact
**None** - This is normal in active development environment with multiple contributors

**Status**: READY FOR SECOND MERGE  
**Confidence**: HIGH
