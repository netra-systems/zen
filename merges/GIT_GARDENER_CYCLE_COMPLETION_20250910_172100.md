## üîß TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS

### Windows Filename Compatibility Solution
**Problem:** Git attempted to create `merges/MERGEISSUE:2025-09-10-15:22.md` (invalid on Windows)
**Solution:** Sparse-checkout strategy to exclude problematic file during merge
**Outcome:** Successfully completed merge and renamed file to Windows-compatible format
**Documentation:** Created reusable process for future Windows development

### Merge Decision Documentation
**Created Files:**
- `MERGEISSUE_20250910_152300.md` - Primary merge documentation
- `PUSH_REJECTED_RESOLUTION_20250910.md` - Push conflict resolution 
- `WINDOWS_FILENAME_MERGE_RESOLUTION_20250910.md` - Technical solution documentation
