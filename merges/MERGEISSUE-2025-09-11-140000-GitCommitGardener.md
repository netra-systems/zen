# Git Commit Gardener Merge Decision Log
**Date:** 2025-09-11  
**Time:** 14:00:00  
**Process:** Git Commit Gardener - Phase 1  
**Branch:** develop-long-lived  

## Merge Context
- **Operation:** Restoring stashed changes after pulling 91 commits from origin
- **Stash Applied:** stash@{1} (Pre-pull stash for git commit gardener - modified files)
- **Conflicts:** 3 files with merge conflicts

## Merge Conflicts Analysis

### 1. `netra_backend/app/websocket_core/handlers.py`
**Conflict Type:** Duplicate compatibility alias definitions  
**Decision:** Keep both - they are the same alias, just remove duplication  
**Justification:** Both upstream and stashed changes add the same WebSocketMessageHandler alias. Safe to keep both sections and consolidate.

### 2. `test_framework/ssot/database.py` 
**Conflict Type:** Different implementations of SSotDatabaseTestMixin  
**Decision:** Keep the full mixin implementation from stashed changes  
**Justification:** 
- Upstream has simple alias: `SSotDatabaseTestMixin = DatabaseTestUtility`
- Stashed changes have full class implementation with methods
- Full implementation is more useful for integration tests
- Keep both in exports for compatibility

### 3. `tests/integration/type_ssot/test_type_ssot_jwt_payload_validation.py`
**Conflict Type:** Different field definitions in ExtendedJWTPayload  
**Decision:** Keep upstream changes (email required, validation)  
**Justification:**
- Upstream version has proper email validation and error handling
- More robust than stashed version which makes email optional
- Upstream version follows better data integrity practices

## Resolution Strategy
1. Manually resolve conflicts by keeping the most robust implementations
2. Ensure no functionality is lost from either version
3. Test after resolution to ensure integration still works
4. Document any behavioral changes

## Safety Assessment
- **Risk Level:** LOW - All conflicts are in compatibility/testing code
- **Business Impact:** NONE - No production code affected
- **Rollback Plan:** Stash entries preserved if needed
