**Timestamp:** 2025-09-15 22:40:54
**Branch:** develop-long-lived
**Operator:** Claude Code (git safety specialist)

## Merge Conflicts Detected
Found 3 files with "UU" (unmerged, both modified) status indicating merge conflicts:

1. `STAGING_TEST_REPORT_PYTEST.md`
2. `temp_issue_body.md`
3. `test_framework/ssot/base_test_case.py`

## Analysis and Resolution Decisions

### 1. STAGING_TEST_REPORT_PYTEST.md
**Conflict Type:** Unmerged file (UU status)
**Content Analysis:**
- Contains staging test report with 1 failed test
- Backend health check failing with 503 Service Unavailable
- Test execution took 24.53 seconds
- Report appears complete and well-formed

**Resolution Decision:** ACCEPT AS-IS
**Justification:** This is a legitimate test report documenting actual test failures. The content is coherent and provides valuable debugging information. No conflicting content detected in file review.

### 2. temp_issue_body.md
**Conflict Type:** Unmerged file (UU status)
**Content Analysis:**
- Contains resolution summary for validate_token import issue
- Documents Five Whys analysis and fix applied
- Shows backward compatibility shim added
- Status marked as RESOLVED ✅

**Resolution Decision:** ACCEPT AS-IS
**Justification:** This appears to be a complete issue resolution document. The content is well-structured and documents a resolved authentication issue. The file appears to be legitimate temporary documentation that should be preserved.

### 3. test_framework/ssot/base_test_case.py
**Conflict Type:** Unmerged file (UU status)
**Content Analysis:**
- Contains SSOT BaseTestCase implementation (1507 lines)
- Critical SSOT infrastructure file
- Provides unified test base classes
- Contains both sync and async test support
- Extensive unittest compatibility layer

**Resolution Decision:** ACCEPT AS-IS
**Justification:** This is a core SSOT infrastructure file that appears complete and functional. The content includes proper SSOT documentation, comprehensive test utilities, and essential compatibility layers. No obvious conflict markers or broken content detected. This is mission-critical infrastructure that must be preserved.

## Safety Validation
- ✅ All three files appear to have complete, coherent content
- ✅ No obvious git conflict markers (<<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>) found in file contents
- ✅ Files contain legitimate, functional code/documentation
- ✅ SSOT compliance maintained in test infrastructure
- ✅ No destructive operations required

## Risk Assessment
**Risk Level:** LOW
- All files contain legitimate content that appears complete
- No code conflicts requiring manual merging
- SSOT infrastructure preserved
- Test reports and documentation maintained

## Next Actions
1. Mark all three files as resolved by adding them to staging
2. Create atomic commits following SPEC guidelines
3. Validate commits don't break system
4. Document commit strategy in separate log
