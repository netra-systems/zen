- Each commit represents single conceptual unit (WebSocket fix, test validation, documentation)
- Related changes kept conceptually separate (different domains: protocol, testing, process)
- All commits reviewable in under 1 minute
- No mixed concerns or broken states
- Proper BVJ (Business Value Justification) included in all commits
- FIVE WHYS methodology referenced for technical fixes

## Repository Safety 

✅ **Safety Measures Applied:**
- Stayed on develop-long-lived branch (no branch switching)
- Used safe git operations (no rebase, no force-push)
- All commits tested and functional before committing
- Working tree clean at completion
- Sequential atomic commits without conflicts

## Git Flow Execution

1. ✅ **Analysis Phase:** Identified 1 modified file + 2 untracked files
2. ✅ **Conceptual Grouping:** Applied SPEC principles for 3 distinct atomic units
3. ✅ **Safe Execution:** Add → Commit → Push workflow for each concept
4. ✅ **Verification:** All commits pushed successfully, working tree clean

## Technical Details

- **Total Commits:** 3 atomic commits
- **Total Changes:** 1 modified file + 2 new files (367 total lines)
- **WebSocket Fix:** Protocol negotiation logic improved (priority reordering)
- **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive auth import validation without dependencies
- **Documentation:** Process tracking for git commit gardener operations
- **Merge Conflicts:** None encountered
- **Push Status:** All commits successfully pushed to remote
- **Working Tree:** Clean (only untracked tests/reports/ directory remains)

## Next Steps

- **Monitoring Status:** Ready for next cycle (waiting for new changes)
- **Repository State:** Clean and ready for development
- **Branch Status:** Up to date with origin/develop-long-lived
- **Safety Status:** All operations completed safely without repository damage
- **Continuation:** Continue monitoring for additional changes

## Business Impact Summary

1. **WebSocket Reliability:** Fixed protocol negotiation ensuring chat functionality works
2. **Auth Validation:** Added comprehensive testing preventing startup failures  
3. **Process Quality:** Documented git gardener cycle maintaining development standards

All changes directly support the core business goal: users login → get AI responses (Golden Path).
