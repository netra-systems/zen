# Git Commit Gardener Merge Decision Log

**Date:** 2025-09-10 13:36:00
**Branch:** develop-long-lived
**Gardener Session:** Cycle 3 - CRITICAL REMEDIATION IMPLEMENTATION

## Change Analysis Summary

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION PHASE DETECTED**

**Total Changes:** 
- 6 modified core implementation files (execution engines, tool dispatcher, database)
- 2 new test/documentation files
- All changes implementing actual SSOT remediation fixes to core system

## Logical Grouping Decision

Following SPEC/git_commit_atomic_units.xml, these changes represent **ONE CRITICAL CONCEPT**:

**"SSOT Remediation Implementation - Core System Fixes"**

### Reasoning (Per Spec Guidelines):
- **Single Concept:** All files implement actual SSOT violation fixes in core components
- **Atomic Completeness:** Complete remediation of SSOT violations across execution layer
- **Dependency Chain:** Execution engine fixes require tool dispatcher and database alignment  
- **Critical System Stability:** Core changes that must be atomic for system stability
- **Business Critical:** Direct fixes to Golden Path execution infrastructure

### Files Analysis:
1. **Core Execution Fixes:**
   - `execution_engine.py` - Core execution engine SSOT compliance
   - `user_execution_engine.py` - User execution context fixes
   - `execution_engine_factory.py` - Factory pattern SSOT compliance
2. **Infrastructure Fixes:**
   - `unified_tool_dispatcher.py` - 58 new lines of SSOT compliance
   - `database/__init__.py` - 35 lines removed (SSOT consolidation)
3. **Documentation:**
   - Configuration bypass remediation completion tracking
   - Performance validation tests
   - Baseline failure documentation

### Spec Compliance Check:
- ✅ **Atomic Completeness:** Complete SSOT remediation across execution layer
- ✅ **System Stability:** All interdependent core fixes in single atomic commit
- ✅ **Business Value Alignment:** Direct fixes to $500K+ ARR Golden Path infrastructure
- ✅ **Critical Priority:** Core system changes that prevent cascade failures
- ✅ **Reviewability:** "Core SSOT remediation implementation" concept

## Commit Strategy Decision

**SINGLE ATOMIC COMMIT** - These are interdependent core system fixes that must be committed together to maintain system stability.

**CRITICAL JUSTIFICATION:**
- Core execution engine changes affect tool dispatcher behavior
- Tool dispatcher changes affect database interaction patterns  
- All components must be aligned to prevent runtime failures
- Golden Path stability depends on these components working together

**BVJ (Business Value Justification):**
- **Segment:** Platform (affects ALL users)
- **Goal:** Stability (CRITICAL) 
- **Impact:** Fixes core SSOT violations that block Golden Path user flows
- **Revenue Impact:** PROTECTS $500K+ ARR by fixing execution engine fragmentation

**Risk Assessment:** HIGH - Core system changes, but all tested with comprehensive test suite

## Alternative Considered

**REJECTED:** Separating by component (execution vs tools vs database)
**Reason:** Would create intermediate broken states violating atomic completeness principle

**REJECTED:** Multiple small commits per file
**Reason:** Breaks dependency chain - these components are interdependent for Golden Path

## Safety Measures

- Complete test suite already exists from previous commits
- Documentation tracking shows remediation phase completion
- Changes are fixing violations, not adding new features
- Emergency fallback patterns maintained per documentation
