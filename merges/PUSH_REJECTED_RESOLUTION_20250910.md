# Push Rejected Resolution - 2025-09-10 17:20:00

## Issue: Remote Contains New Work
**Time:** 2025-09-10 17:20:00  
**Operation:** `git push origin develop-long-lived`  
**Error:** Remote contains work that we do not have locally

## Analysis
- Successfully completed local merge of 29 remote commits with 9 local commits
- During merge process, additional commits were pushed to remote
- Need to integrate latest remote changes before pushing

## Resolution Strategy
1. **FETCH:** Get latest remote changes
2. **MERGE:** Integrate new remote work with our merged state  
3. **DOCUMENT:** Record any new merge decisions
4. **PUSH:** Complete the push operation

## Safety Considerations
- Our local work is complete and merged successfully
- Windows encoding utilities are working properly
- WebSocket SSOT consolidation is integrated
- Any new conflicts should be minimal since we already handled the major integration

## Next Actions
1. Fetch latest remote changes
2. Merge with automatic merge commit
3. Document any conflicts or decisions
4. Push successfully

**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Resolving push rejection
