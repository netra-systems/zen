# Git Merge Decision Log - Iteration 14
**Date:** 2025-09-10 20:18  
**Commit Gardener Session:** Iteration 14 (8 atomic commits)  
**Branch:** develop-long-lived  

## Merge Situation
**Issue:** Remote contains work not present locally during push attempt  
**Local State:** 7 commits ahead of last successful push  
**Decision:** Use git merge (never rebase per user instructions)

## Iteration 14 Commits Being Merged
1. **WebSocket Error Validator SSOT compatibility** - 136e33010
2. **Golden Path test infrastructure enhancements** - cb1866c39  
3. **Issue #261 ExecutionResult API test plan documentation** - 64a1be9b2
4. **Issue #263 validation infrastructure** - 605cbd7f4
5. **ExecutionResult API test suite for Golden Path validation** - 02baad671
6. **Issue #263 interface compatibility validation** - 2c62a593d
7. **Plus additional ExecutionResult API remediation** - d9b447262

## Business Value of Local Commits
- **P0 CRITICAL:** Issue #261 ExecutionResult API fixes enabling $500K+ ARR Golden Path validation
- **HIGH:** Issue #263 SSOT base class compatibility improvements
- **CRITICAL:** Golden Path test infrastructure enhancements for business value validation

## Merge Strategy
- **Method:** git pull (merge) - following user's explicit "ALWAYS prefer GIT MERGE over rebase" guidance
- **Safety:** Repository history preservation maintained  
- **Documentation:** This log documents merge reasoning and business justification

## Expected Outcome
Successful integration of remote changes with local atomic commits while preserving:
- All 8 iteration 14 commits with business value justification
- Complete commit history and attribution
- No rebase usage (dangerous per user guidance)

## Execution
```bash
git pull origin develop-long-lived  # Will create merge commit
git push origin develop-long-lived  # Push merged result
```

**Commit Gardener Process:** Continues monitoring after successful merge
**Safety Priority:** Repository integrity and history preservation over convenience
