### Mission Critical Test Suite
```bash
# Core validation suite - MUST PASS before deployment
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py
python tests/mission_critical/test_no_ssot_violations.py
python tests/mission_critical/test_orchestration_integration.py
python tests/mission_critical/test_docker_stability_suite.py
```
