# Master Work In Progress Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-06  
**Status:** Active Development

## ðŸš¨ Critical TODOs

### Test Coverage Recreation (HIGH PRIORITY)
**627 corrupted test files were deleted on 2025-01-06**  
See [DELETED_TESTS_COVERAGE_RECORD.md](./DELETED_TESTS_COVERAGE_RECORD.md) for full list

#### Immediate Coverage Gaps:
1. **WebSocket Agent Communication** - Critical for chat functionality
2. **Agent Registry & Handoffs** - Core agent orchestration
3. **Triage Decision Logic** - Business logic routing
4. **Flow Transitions** - Workflow state management

#### Phase 1: Critical Coverage (Week 1)
- [ ] Recreate WebSocket agent communication tests
- [ ] Recreate agent handoff and registry tests
- [ ] Recreate triage decision logic tests
- [ ] Recreate flow transition tests

#### Phase 2: Business Logic (Week 2)
- [ ] Recreate action feasibility tests
- [ ] Recreate optimization value tests
- [ ] Recreate report completeness tests
- [ ] Recreate data helper clarity tests

#### Phase 3: Corpus Operations (Week 3)
- [ ] Recreate corpus creation and validation tests
- [ ] Recreate upload and indexing handler tests
- [ ] Recreate CRUD operation tests
- [ ] Recreate parser and validator tests

## Current System Health

### Test Suite Status
- **Deleted Files:** 627 corrupted test files removed
- **Reason:** Files contained REMOVED_SYNTAX_ERROR markers and commented-out code
- **Impact:** Significant test coverage gaps need addressing
- **Priority:** HIGH - Critical functionality lacks test coverage

### Known Issues
1. Test coverage significantly reduced after cleanup
2. WebSocket agent events lack comprehensive testing
3. Agent orchestration tests need recreation
4. Business logic validation tests missing

## Development Priorities

1. **Stabilize Core Systems** - Per CLAUDE.md directive
2. **Recreate Critical Test Coverage** - Focus on user-facing functionality
3. **Maintain Working System** - No new features until tests restored
4. **WebSocket Events** - Ensure chat functionality fully tested
