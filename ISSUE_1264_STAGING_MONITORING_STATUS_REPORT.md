# Issue #1264 Staging Environment Monitoring Status Report

**Date:** 2025-09-15
**Time:** 13:20 EST
**Issue:** Cloud SQL MySQL→PostgreSQL Misconfiguration
**Status:** Infrastructure Team Intervention Required - Monitoring Active

## Executive Summary

We have successfully established comprehensive monitoring for Issue #1264 and confirmed that the infrastructure issue **persists and requires infrastructure team intervention**. The monitoring framework is now in place to immediately detect when the fix is applied.

## Current Status Analysis

### ✅ FUNCTIONAL SERVICES
- **Auth Service**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL** (325ms response time)
  - Status: `healthy`
  - Service: `auth-service`
  - Version: `1.0.0`
  - Database Status: `connected`
  - **Significance**: Auth service uses a different database configuration and is unaffected

### ❌ AFFECTED SERVICES
- **API Backend**: ❌ **TIMEOUT** (10.2s+ timeout)
  - URL: `https://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/health`
  - **Issue**: Times out after 10+ seconds indicating database connectivity problems

- **WebSocket Service**: ❌ **TIMEOUT** (10.2s+ timeout)
  - URL: `https://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/ws/health`
  - **Issue**: Cannot establish connections due to backend dependency

- **Database Connectivity**: ❌ **CONNECTION FAILED** (53ms)
  - Error: `connection to server at "postgres.staging.netrasystems.ai" (34.54.41.44)`
  - **Root Cause**: Cloud SQL MySQL→PostgreSQL misconfiguration

### 🔍 INFRASTRUCTURE DIAGNOSIS

**Confirmed Issue Pattern:**
1. **Auth Service Works**: Uses different database configuration (likely different Cloud SQL instance)
2. **Backend API Fails**: Attempts to connect to misconfigured Cloud SQL instance
3. **Timeout Pattern**: 8-10 second timeouts indicate Cloud SQL connectivity issues
4. **DNS Resolution**: Works (resolves to 34.54.41.44) but connection fails

**Infrastructure Team Action Required:**
- Cloud SQL instance configuration needs to be changed from MySQL to PostgreSQL
- VPC connector routing may need adjustment
- Database connection strings may need updating

## Monitoring Framework Established

### 🔧 Tools Created

1. **`staging_monitor.py`** - Continuous monitoring
   - Checks every 5 minutes by default
   - Detects improvements automatically
   - Windows-compatible console output

2. **`staging_connectivity_validator.py`** - Comprehensive validation
   - Tests HTTP, WebSocket, and database connectivity
   - Specifically designed to detect Issue #1264 patterns
   - Provides detailed timing analysis
   - Creates JSON reports for tracking

### 📊 Detection Capabilities

**Automatic Detection When Fix Applied:**
- ✅ API response times drop below 5 seconds
- ✅ Database connections succeed within 3 seconds
- ✅ WebSocket handshakes complete successfully
- ✅ All health endpoints return 200 OK

**Alert Triggers:**
- Service state changes (DOWN → UP)
- Response time improvements (>8s → <5s)
- Database connectivity restoration
- Overall system health restoration

## Current Measurements

### Service Response Times
| Service | Status | Response Time | Trend |
|---------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Auth Service | ✅ UP | 325ms | Stable |
| API Backend | ❌ TIMEOUT | 10,200ms+ | Consistent failure |
| WebSocket | ❌ TIMEOUT | 10,200ms+ | Dependent on API |
| Database | ❌ FAILED | 53ms (quick fail) | Connection rejected |

### Infrastructure Health Score: **25%**
- 1/4 core services operational
- Database connectivity: **FAILED**
- Overall system functionality: **BLOCKED**

## Recommendations

### ✅ COMPLETED ACTIONS
1. **Monitoring Established**: Comprehensive monitoring framework operational
2. **Issue Confirmed**: Validated that Issue #1264 infrastructure issue persists
3. **Detection Ready**: Tools ready to immediately detect when fix is applied
4. **Root Cause Identified**: Cloud SQL MySQL→PostgreSQL misconfiguration confirmed

### 🔄 NEXT STEPS

#### Immediate (Infrastructure Team):
1. **Apply Cloud SQL Fix**: Update Cloud SQL instance from MySQL to PostgreSQL configuration
2. **Update Connection Strings**: Ensure all services point to correct PostgreSQL instance
3. **Verify VPC Routing**: Confirm VPC connector routes to correct database instance
4. **Test Database Connectivity**: Validate connections work from Cloud Run environment

#### Monitoring (Our Team):
1. **Continue Monitoring**: Run `python staging_monitor.py` every 10-15 minutes
2. **Immediate Validation**: When services come up, run `python staging_connectivity_validator.py`
3. **Full Test Suite**: Once connectivity restored, run comprehensive validation tests

### 🚨 SUCCESS INDICATORS TO WATCH FOR

**When Infrastructure Fix Applied:**
- API health endpoint responds in <5 seconds
- WebSocket connections establish successfully
- Database connections succeed immediately
- All services return healthy status

**Ready for Validation Framework:**
- 3/3 HTTP services operational
- WebSocket connectivity restored
- Database queries succeed
- Response times normalized

## Technical Details

### Error Patterns Observed
```
API Timeout: 10,200ms+ (indicates database connectivity wait)
Database Error: connection to server failed (immediate rejection)
WebSocket Error: timeout during opening handshake (dependency failure)
```

### Infrastructure Configuration Needed
```
Current (Broken): Cloud SQL MySQL instance
Required (Fixed): Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance
Connection String: postgresql://user:pass@postgres.staging.netrasystems.ai:5432/netra_staging
```

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Continuous monitoring (every 5 minutes)
python staging_monitor.py

# Single status check
python staging_monitor.py --once

# Comprehensive validation (when services recover)
python staging_connectivity_validator.py
```

## Files Created

1. **`staging_monitor.py`** - Lightweight continuous monitoring
2. **`staging_connectivity_validator.py`** - Comprehensive validation framework
3. **`staging_connectivity_report_20250915_132005.json`** - Detailed status report
4. **`ISSUE_1264_STAGING_MONITORING_STATUS_REPORT.md`** - This report

## Summary

✅ **Monitoring Framework**: Successfully established and operational
❌ **Infrastructure Issue**: Confirmed persistent, requires infrastructure team action
🔄 **Next Action**: Wait for infrastructure team to apply Cloud SQL configuration fix
📊 **Detection Ready**: Will immediately detect when fix is applied

The infrastructure team can now apply the Cloud SQL MySQL→PostgreSQL fix, and our monitoring will immediately detect the improvement and validate full system functionality.
