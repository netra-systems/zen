# Issue #1292 Resolution Execution Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-16
**Status:** READY FOR EXECUTION
**Script:** `execute_issue_1292_resolution.sh`

## Overview

Based on comprehensive analysis in the untangle report and master plan, Issue #1292 "Tangled auth websockets agents integration confusion" has been resolved through architectural clarity and broken down into 5 focused, actionable sub-issues implementing industry-standard ticket-based authentication.

## Root Cause Resolution

**Problem:** Browser WebSocket protocol prevents Authorization headers during upgrade requests (RFC 6455 compliance), but the system accumulated 6 competing authentication workarounds instead of accepting this fundamental constraint.

**Solution:** Industry-standard ticket-based authentication that works within WebSocket protocol limitations.
