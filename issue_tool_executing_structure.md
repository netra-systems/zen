## üö® P1 CRITICAL: Tool Executing Event Missing Tool Name - User Tool Transparency Broken

**Discovered By:** Failing Test Gardener Processing  
**Business Impact:** CRITICAL P1 - Tool execution events missing tool_name field, users cannot see what tools are being used  
**Revenue Risk:** $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality compromised  
**Test:** `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py::TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_tool_executing_event_structure`

## üîç PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

**Test Failure:** `test_tool_executing_event_structure` - AssertionError: tool_executing missing tool_name  
**Location:** `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`  
**Error:** `assert 'tool_name' in received_event`  
**Category:** failing-test-regression-high-websocket-tool-executing-structure-validation  

### Critical Business Impact
- **Tool Transparency Broken:** Users cannot see which tools AI is using on their behalf
- **Trust Impact:** Users lose visibility into AI problem-solving approach
- **Golden Path Disrupted:** Essential tool execution transparency missing from chat flow
- **AI Value Proposition:** Tool usage is core to demonstrating AI capabilities to users

## üìä TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Test Execution Results (2025-09-14)
```
AssertionError: tool_executing missing tool_name
assert 'tool_name' in received_event
```

### Current Event Payload Analysis
**Received Event:**
```json
{
  "correlation_id": null,
  "data": {"connection_id": "main_cea7ce8d", "...": "..."},
  "server_id": null, 
  "timestamp": 1757857637.180978,
  "type": "connection_established"
}
```

### Expected Event Structure
The test expects `tool_executing` events to contain:
```json
{
  "type": "tool_executing",
  "tool_name": "search_tool",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "user search term",
    "max_results": 10
  },
  "execution_id": "uuid-string",
  "user_id": "mission_critical_user",
  "thread_id": "test_thread",
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```

### Root Cause Identified
- **Event Type Mismatch:** Server sends `connection_established` instead of `tool_executing`
- **Missing Required Field:** `tool_name` field completely absent from event payload
- **No Tool Information:** Event contains no tool execution details for user transparency

## üéØ BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Primary Impact: Tool Transparency Completely Broken ($500K+ ARR Risk)
- **No Tool Visibility:** Users cannot see which tools AI is executing (search, analysis, etc.)
- **Trust Erosion:** Users can't verify AI is using appropriate tools for their requests
- **Value Demonstration:** Tool usage is key to showing AI's problem-solving capabilities
- **Chat Experience:** Tool transparency is core to 90% of platform value (substantive AI interactions)

### Secondary Impact: Development & Production Risk
- **Mission Critical Test Suite:** Core business tool transparency validation compromised
- **Regression Detection:** Future tool execution visibility issues may go unnoticed
- **Production Risk:** Tool transparency failures could reach users, reducing trust

## üîó RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING ISSUES

### Related Issues  
- **Issue #1021 (P0):** "CRITICAL: WebSocket Event Structure Validation Failures - Golden Path Blocker" (comprehensive)
- **Issue #973 (P1):** "failing-test-regression-p1-websocket-event-structure-validation" (general WebSocket)
- **Issue #935 (P1):** "failing-test-regression-p1-tool-completed-missing-results" (tool_completed specific)
- **Issue #1038 (P1):** "failing-test-regression-high-websocket-agent-started-structure-validation" (agent_started specific)

### Issue Coordination
This issue provides **specific focus** on the tool_executing event structure failure, while:
- **Issue #1021** provides comprehensive P0 tracking of all 3 failures
- **Issue #973** covers broader WebSocket event validation issues
- **Same root cause pattern** as other WebSocket event structure issues

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION NEEDED

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **WebSocket Event Routing:** Why does server return `connection_established` instead of `tool_executing`?
2. **Tool Event Generation:** Are tool_executing events properly created with tool_name field?
3. **Tool Execution Flow:** Is tool execution properly triggering WebSocket events?
4. **Event Serialization:** Are tool_name fields being stripped during transmission?

### Investigation Commands
```bash
# Run specific failing test
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py::TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_tool_executing_event_structure

# Check tool_executing event generation
grep -r "tool_executing" netra_backend/app/websocket_core/
grep -r "tool_executing" netra_backend/app/agents/
grep -r "tool_name" netra_backend/app/tools/

# Validate tool execution WebSocket integration
grep -r "EnhancedToolExecutionEngine" netra_backend/app/agents/
grep -r "UnifiedToolExecutionEngine" netra_backend/app/agents/
```

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Definition of Done
- [ ] `tool_executing` events contain required `tool_name` field
- [ ] Events include tool execution details: tool_name, parameters, execution_id
- [ ] Test `test_tool_executing_event_structure` passes consistently
- [ ] Users can see which tools AI is executing in real-time via WebSocket
- [ ] Event type is correctly `tool_executing` (not `connection_established`)

### Validation Requirements
- [ ] Tool name accurately reflects the actual tool being executed
- [ ] Event structure validation passes in strict mode for tool_executing events
- [ ] Tool parameters and execution context included for user transparency
- [ ] No regression in other WebSocket event types
- [ ] Integration with tool execution engine and WebSocket event emission

## üö® PRIORITY JUSTIFICATION

**P1 Classification Rationale:**
- **Business Critical:** Tool transparency is essential for user trust in AI capabilities
- **User Experience:** Users need to see what tools AI uses to solve their problems
- **Revenue Risk:** $500K+ ARR depends on users seeing substantive AI tool interactions
- **Golden Path Component:** Tool execution visibility is core to AI value demonstration
- **Trust Building:** Users need transparency into AI problem-solving approach

**Immediate Attention Required:** Tool execution transparency is fundamental to AI platform value proposition.

---

**Coordination Note:** This issue should be coordinated with Issue #1021 (P0) for comprehensive WebSocket event structure resolution and aligned with broader tool execution transparency requirements.
