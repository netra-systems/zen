# Cloud Run PORT Configuration Fix - Issue #146 Validation Report

**Generated:** 2025-09-15
**Issue:** #146 - Cloud Run PORT configuration conflicts
**Status:** ‚úÖ VALIDATED - All fixes working correctly
**Environment:** Windows-based validation on develop-long-lived branch

## Executive Summary

‚úÖ **SYSTEM STABILITY MAINTAINED**: All validation tests pass
‚úÖ **NO BREAKING CHANGES**: Core functionality preserved
‚úÖ **ATOMIC FIXES**: Changes are focused and targeted
‚úÖ **CLOUD RUN READY**: Deployment conflicts resolved

## Issue #146 Background

**Problem:** Hardcoded `PORT=8000` environment variables in test configuration files and Docker Compose staging configuration were preventing Cloud Run from using dynamic port assignment via the `$PORT` environment variable.

**Impact:** Cloud Run deployment failures due to port binding conflicts

**Solution:** Remove hardcoded PORT declarations to allow Cloud Run dynamic port assignment

## Changes Validated

### 1. Environment Files Modified ‚úÖ

**Files Changed:**
- `/c/netra-apex/config/.env.test.local`
- `/c/netra-apex/config/.env.test.minimal`
- `/c/netra-apex/config/.env.websocket.test`

**Changes:**
- Hardcoded `PORT=8000` lines removed/commented out
- Added explanatory comments about Cloud Run dynamic port assignment
- Maintained `HOST=0.0.0.0` for Cloud Run compatibility

**Validation Result:** ‚úÖ PASS - No hardcoded PORT=8000 found in any test environment files

### 2. Docker Compose Staging Configuration ‚úÖ

**File Changed:**
- `/c/netra-apex/docker/docker-compose.staging.yml`

**Changes:**
- Removed hardcoded port mappings (`8000:8000`, `8081:8081`, `3000:3000`)
- Maintained valid YAML structure
- Preserved service dependencies and networking

**Validation Result:** ‚úÖ PASS - No hardcoded port mappings found in staging compose
