**SSOT Violation:** Multiple agent registry implementations causing execution failures
- Incomplete migration from legacy singleton patterns to factory-based execution
- WebSocket event delivery failures due to registry fragmentation
- Golden Path user flow interrupted by agent execution failures

## Progress Tracking

### ‚úÖ Step 0: SSOT AUDIT - COMPLETE
- [x] Discovered critical AgentRegistry SSOT violation
- [x] Created GitHub issue #1080
