**Status:** üîç Step 0: Discovery Complete

## Critical SSOT Violation Summary

**Business Impact:** Users cannot complete core value proposition - login ‚Üí get AI responses

**SSOT Violation:** Multiple agent registry implementations causing execution failures
- Incomplete migration from legacy singleton patterns to factory-based execution
- WebSocket event delivery failures due to registry fragmentation
- Golden Path user flow interrupted by agent execution failures

## Progress Tracking

### ‚úÖ Step 0: SSOT AUDIT - COMPLETE
- [x] Discovered critical AgentRegistry SSOT violation
- [x] Created GitHub issue #1080
- [x] Identified business impact: $500K+ ARR affected
- [x] Priority: P0 - Golden Path blocking

### ‚úÖ Step 1: DISCOVER AND PLAN TEST - COMPLETE
- [x] 1.1: Discover existing tests protecting against breaking changes
- [x] 1.2: Plan new tests for SSOT validation and violation reproduction

#### Key Findings:
**Excellent existing test coverage discovered:**
- 169 mission critical tests protecting $500K+ ARR 
- Comprehensive WebSocket integration tests (587 related files)
- Robust factory pattern and multi-user isolation tests
- Complete Golden Path E2E validation on staging

**Planned new test suites (20% new tests):**
- **Violation Reproduction Tests:** `test_agent_registry_ssot_violation_reproduction.py` (must fail initially)
- **Compliance Validation Tests:** `test_agent_registry_ssot_compliance_validation.py` (must pass after fix)
- **Enhanced Existing Tests:** Leverage 60% existing robust infrastructure

**Strategy:** Non-Docker tests only (unit, integration non-docker, E2E staging GCP)

### üîÑ Step 2: EXECUTE TEST PLAN - PENDING  
- [ ] Execute new SSOT violation reproduction tests
- [ ] Execute new SSOT compliance validation tests
- [ ] Validate test failures/passes as expected

### ‚è≥ Next Steps
- [ ] Step 3: Plan SSOT remediation strategy
- [ ] Step 4: Execute remediation plan
- [ ] Step 5: Test fix loop validation
- [ ] Step 6: PR and closure

## Files Under Investigation
- Agent registry implementations across multiple locations
- WebSocket integration with agent systems  
- Factory pattern implementations for multi-user isolation

## Evidence of Impact
- Staging environment logs show agent registration conflicts
- Mission critical tests designed to fail until resolved
- Golden Path user flow interrupted by agent execution failures
