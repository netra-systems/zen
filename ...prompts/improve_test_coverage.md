## User Experience Critical Paths
20. **Typing Indicator Accuracy** - No tests for "agent is typing" indicator reliability
21. **Message Edit/Delete Propagation** - Missing tests for real-time message modification
22. **Presence Detection** - No tests for user online/offline status accuracy
23. **Multi-Tab Synchronization** - Missing tests for chat sync across browser tabs
24. **Mobile Responsiveness** - No tests for chat behavior on mobile connections

## Agent Communication Quality
25. **Streaming Response Chunking** - Missing tests for smooth token-by-token streaming
26. **Tool Progress Updates** - No tests validating granular tool execution progress
27. **Agent Context Switching** - Missing tests for chat context preservation during agent handoffs
28. **Error Message Clarity** - No tests validating user-friendly error messages
29. **Agent Timeout Handling** - Missing tests for graceful long-running agent timeouts
