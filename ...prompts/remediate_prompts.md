E2E Test Results Summary - Staging Environment

  ❌ Critical Failures Detected

  1. WebSocket Agent Events Suite (Mission Critical)
  - ✅ Component tests passed (12/12)
    - WebSocket notifier methods working
    - Tool dispatcher integration functional
    - Agent registry integration working
  - ❌ CRITICAL: Real WebSocket validation failed
    - No required agent events received (expected: agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, tool_completed, agent_completed)
    - Only received acknowledgment events
    - Business Impact: Core chat functionality ($500K+ ARR) not working properly

  2. Database Connection Tests
  - ❌ Failed to establish database connections
  - Unable to run database category tests
  - Impact: Data persistence layer unavailable

  3. Smoke Tests
  - ❌ Basic smoke tests failing
  - Indicates fundamental system issues in staging environment

  Key Issues Identified:

  1. WebSocket Event Pipeline Broken: The critical WebSocket events required for agent-user communication are not being transmitted properly
   in staging
  2. Database Connectivity: Test database connections failing, preventing data-driven tests
  3. Environment Configuration: Staging environment appears misconfigured for test execution
  4. Pytest Collection Errors: File I/O errors during test collection indicate potential environment issues

  Recommendations:

  1. Immediate: Fix WebSocket event transmission in staging - this is blocking core business value
  2. High Priority: Verify staging database configurations and connectivity
  3. Medium Priority: Investigate pytest collection issues on Windows environment
  4. Monitoring: Add staging environment health checks before test execution

  The staging environment is currently not operational for the core chat functionality that delivers business value to users.
