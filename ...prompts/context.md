CAREFULLY generate a master "CONTEXT" document for the overall system. things that are most important of how the
  system (all 6 services) relate together. assumptions. business expecations. critical paths. key goals. confusing
  stuff. especially focus on things that take a long time to "discovery" just reading each file. CAREFULLY NAVIGATE
  WAY AROUND CODEBASE, EXISTING READMES AND INDEXES, EXISTING XMLS ETC. TO GENERATE THIS. SAVE YOUR PROCESS AND
  LEARNINGS AND CREATE A SPEC FOR THIS OVERALL PROCESS
