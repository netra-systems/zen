PROVE and AUDIT every aspect of REPORT if it is True or False with clear EVIDENCE.
REPORT:
  I've completed a deep audit and fix of the critical WebSocket initialization issue using the 5 Whys methodology:

  Root Cause

  The service factory was creating SupervisorAgent instances with None dependencies (including the critical
  AgentWebSocketBridge), violating the deterministic startup principle. This broke 90% of the chat functionality.

  Fix Implemented

  1. service_factory.py: Changed functions to raise NotImplementedError instead of creating incomplete services
  2. agent_service.py: Fixed fallback methods that were also creating agents without dependencies
  3. mcp/service_factory.py: Fixed WebSocket fallback to properly error instead of creating broken services

  Result

  - Service factory no longer creates services with None dependencies
  - Clear error messages guide to use properly initialized services from app.state
  - Deterministic startup ensures all critical services have proper dependencies
  - WebSocket bridge is guaranteed to be initialized during startup

  The fix ensures that services requiring the AgentWebSocketBridge are only created during the deterministic startup
   sequence with all required dependencies, preventing the chat-breaking initialization failure.

For every FALSE item spawn agent to finish the job correctly.
After run tests and prove again it is now complete
REPORT:

No imports found. Let me finalize the todo:

● Complete! BaseExecutionInterface has been fully removed from the codebase.

  Summary of all changes:

  1. ✅ Removed all references from data_sub_agent module (17+ files)
  2. ✅ Removed temporary MRO analysis files that were importing it
  3. ✅ Renamed the Protocol in executor.py from BaseExecutionInterface to AgentExecutionProtocol
  4. ✅ Cleaned all comments and docstrings across the entire agents directory
  5. ✅ Updated test files to remove references

  Final verification:

  - No import statements for BaseExecutionInterface remain
  - 100% removed
  - The codebase now correctly reflects single inheritance architecture without BaseExecutionInterface
