Testing coverage is getting better
Gap is actual real system improvement
e.g. we are confirming that the existing system works for certain items
BUT the overall robustness of system itself isn't really stepping up as much as it could/needs to
Rather do some more general defensive items there (within reason eg. no fake fallbacks)
then keep "fixing" the limitations of current state with tests
