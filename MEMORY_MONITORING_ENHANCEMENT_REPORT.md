## Integration Points

### Service Startup Integration
Memory monitoring is now integrated into the service startup workflow:

1. **Pre-flight Check** ‚Üí Validates memory before starting services
2. **Startup Monitoring** ‚Üí Monitors memory during docker-compose operations  
3. **Health Check Monitoring** ‚Üí Continuous monitoring during health validation
4. **Final Reporting** ‚Üí Memory status when all services are healthy

### Health Check Integration
Enhanced the `wait_for_services()` method with periodic memory monitoring:

- Memory checks every 10 seconds during health validation
- Emergency warnings if memory usage becomes critical
- Final memory report when services become healthy
- Timeout analysis with memory correlation

# Memory monitoring runs automatically during service operations
success = await manager.start_services_smart(['backend', 'postgres', 'redis'])
```

### 2. Manual Memory Check
```python
# Get current memory status
snapshot = manager.monitor_memory_during_operations()
if snapshot:
    print(f"Memory usage: {snapshot.system_memory.percentage:.1f}%")
    print(f"Threshold: {snapshot.get_max_threshold_level().value}")
```
