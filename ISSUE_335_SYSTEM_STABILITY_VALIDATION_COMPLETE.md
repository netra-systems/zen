```

**Result**: The enhanced `safe_websocket_close` function correctly handles both connected and disconnected states without exceptions.

### 2. System Import Validation ✅ **PASSED**

**Test Executed**: Critical system component imports
```bash
PASS: Enhanced safe_websocket_close function imports successfully
PASS: WebSocketManager imports successfully
PASS: Configuration system imports successfully
SUCCESS: Core WebSocket functionality intact - no breaking changes detected

### 5. Integration Testing ✅ **NO REGRESSIONS**

**Import Dependencies**: All related WebSocket infrastructure imports working
- WebSocket core utilities ✅
- WebSocket manager factory ✅
- Configuration system ✅
- Auth integration ✅

**Result**: No integration regressions detected - all systems maintain compatibility.

## Enhanced Functionality Details

### Production Race Condition Handling

**Enhanced Logic**:
```python
# Pre-close state validation prevents unnecessary operations
if hasattr(websocket, 'client_state'):
    if client_state == WebSocketState.DISCONNECTED:
        return  # Skip close - already disconnected

# Production error categorization
recoverable_errors = [
    "Need to call 'accept' first",
    "WebSocket is not connected",
    "Connection is already closed",
    "Cannot send to a closing connection",
    "Cannot send to a closed connection"
]
```

**Cloud Run Optimizations**:
- Timeout-related disconnection handling
- Load balancer connection drop resilience
- Infrastructure update tolerance

### Production Debugging Enhancement

**Enhanced Context Logging**:
```python
logger.warning(f"Unexpected {error_type} during WebSocket close (code: {code}, attempted: {close_attempted}): {e}")
if hasattr(websocket, 'client_state'):
    current_state = _safe_websocket_state_for_logging(websocket.client_state)
    logger.debug(f"WebSocket client_state during error: {current_state}")
```
