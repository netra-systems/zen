- **CLAUDE.md Policy:** All PRs must target `develop-long-lived` as working branch
- **Risk Level:** HIGH - Violates established branch safety policy
- **Required Action:** Change target branch before merging

### Conflict Status - CRITICAL BLOCKER 🚨

### Business Impact (from PR Description)
- **Issue #321:** Critical bug fix enabling production deployment
- **Issue #276:** 278x performance improvement for Golden Path tests
- **Combined Value:** $500K+ ARR protection through faster, more reliable deployment

### 🚨 RED FLAGS AND CONCERNS

1. **WRONG TARGET BRANCH** ⚠️
   - PR targets `main` instead of `develop-long-lived`
   - Violates CLAUDE.md working branch policy
   - Must be corrected before merge consideration

2. **MERGE CONFLICTS** 🚨
   - Cannot be merged in current state
   - Conflicts must be resolved first
   - Risk of introducing breaking changes

3. **MASSIVE SCOPE** ⚠️
   - 100,967 additions across 100 files
   - High risk for introducing regressions
   - Requires thorough review despite "atomic" claim

4. **NO CI VALIDATION** ⚠️
   - No checks reported on source branch
   - Cannot verify code quality or test passage
   - Deployment readiness unknown

5. **NO REVIEWS** ⚠️
   - No code review approval yet
   - Large scope requires careful review
   - Business impact claims need verification

### Safety Assessment for Merge
- **MERGE READINESS:** ❌ NOT READY
- **PRIMARY BLOCKERS:**
  1. Wrong target branch (main vs develop-long-lived)
  2. Merge conflicts present
  3. No CI validation
  4. No code review approval
  5. Massive scope requires careful validation

### Required Actions Before Merge Consideration
1. **Change Target Branch:** From `main` to `develop-long-lived`
2. **Resolve Merge Conflicts:** Address all conflicting files
3. **CI Validation:** Ensure all checks pass
4. **Code Review:** Get approval from reviewers
5. **Scope Validation:** Verify "atomic" claims match actual changes

### Next Steps for prmergergit Process
- **CANNOT PROCEED with current merge:** Critical blockers present
- **Recommendation:** Address target branch and conflicts first
- **Alternative:** Consider decomposition into smaller, safer PRs
- **Priority:** Fix policy violation (wrong target branch) immediately
