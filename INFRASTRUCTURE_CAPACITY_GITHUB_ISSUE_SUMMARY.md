**File**: `INFRASTRUCTURE_CAPACITY_REMEDIATION_GITHUB_ISSUE.md`

**Key Features**:
- Follows @GITHUB_STYLE_GUIDE.md formatting requirements
- Business-focused title emphasizing $500K+ ARR impact
- Clear current vs expected behavior comparison

### 2. GitHub Issue Creation Script
**File**: `create_infrastructure_capacity_github_issue.sh`

**Features**:
- Uses `gh` CLI to create issue with proper labels
- Includes all required metadata (labels, assignees, milestone)
- Full issue body with markdown formatting
- Automated execution with confirmation messages

## Issue Content Overview

### Business Impact Section
- **Revenue Impact**: $500K+ ARR pipeline blocked
- **Customer Impact**: Validation and demonstrations impossible
- **Technical Impact**: Golden Path user workflow non-functional

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Based On**: Comprehensive Five Whys analysis completed
- **Core Issue**: Infrastructure provisioned for dev workloads, not production scale
- **Evidence**: 95% reproducible failure patterns documented

### Technical Details
```yaml
Key Infrastructure Problems:
  VPC_Connector: Overwhelmed (3 instances â†’ need 5-50 instances)
  Database: 5+ second responses (should be <500ms)
  Redis: 100% connectivity failure to 10.166.204.83:6379
  Cloud_Run: Resource exhaustion (need 4GB RAM, 2 vCPU, 600s timeout)
```

### Remediation Plan (4 Phases)
1. **Phase 1 (0-4h)**: Emergency VPC connector scaling - P0 CRITICAL
2. **Phase 2 (4-8h)**: Database configuration fixes - P0 CRITICAL
3. **Phase 3 (8-16h)**: Cloud Run resource scaling - P1 HIGH
4. **Phase 4 (16-24h)**: Monitoring implementation - P1 HIGH

### Success Criteria
- Agent execution: <30s (from current 120+s)
- Database response: <500ms (from current 5+s)
- Redis connectivity: 100% (from current 0%)
- Golden Path completion: 95% (from current 0%)

## Labels and Metadata

**Labels Applied**:
- `P0` (Critical Priority)
- `infrastructure-dependency` (Area)
- `business-critical` (Type)
- `claude-code-generated-issue` (Generated)

**Assignees**: Infrastructure Team (Primary), Development Team (Supporting)
**Milestone**: Production Readiness - Q4 2025

## How to Create the Issue

### Option 1: Using the Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Make script executable (if needed)
chmod +x create_infrastructure_capacity_github_issue.sh

# Execute the script
./create_infrastructure_capacity_github_issue.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Creation
1. Copy content from `INFRASTRUCTURE_CAPACITY_REMEDIATION_GITHUB_ISSUE.md`
2. Use GitHub web interface or `gh` CLI
3. Apply labels: `P0`, `infrastructure-dependency`, `business-critical`, `claude-code-generated-issue`
4. Assign to infrastructure team
5. Set milestone to "Production Readiness - Q4 2025"

### Option 3: GitHub CLI Command
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[CRITICAL] Infrastructure Capacity Crisis Blocks $500K+ ARR Agent Execution Pipeline" \
  --label "P0,infrastructure-dependency,business-critical,claude-code-generated-issue" \
  --assignee "@infrastructure-team" \
  --milestone "Production Readiness - Q4 2025" \
  --body-file INFRASTRUCTURE_CAPACITY_REMEDIATION_GITHUB_ISSUE.md
```

## Validation and References

### Supporting Documentation
- **Five Whys Analysis**: `COMPREHENSIVE_FIVE_WHYS_INFRASTRUCTURE_ANALYSIS_2025-09-16.md`
- **Detailed Remediation Plan**: `ISSUE_1278_COMPREHENSIVE_INFRASTRUCTURE_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`
- **SSOT Compliance**: Maintains 98.7% compliance during all fixes

### Post-Creation Actions
1. **Infrastructure Team**: Begin Phase 1 (VPC connector scaling) immediately
2. **Development Team**: Prepare Phase 2 configuration updates
3. **GCP Support**: Engage for any infrastructure blocks during P0 phases
4. **Business Team**: Timeline for revenue pipeline restoration (24 hours)

## Business Value

### Immediate Business Recovery
- **$500K+ ARR Pipeline**: Restoration within 24 hours
- **Customer Demonstrations**: Functional after Phase 2 (8 hours)
- **Revenue Validation**: Full capability after Phase 3 (16 hours)

### Long-term Prevention
- **Capacity Planning**: Infrastructure-business alignment
- **Monitoring**: Proactive issue detection
- **Architecture**: Production-ready infrastructure standards
