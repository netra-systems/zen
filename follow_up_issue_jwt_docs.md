# Follow-up Issue: JWT Token Validation Flow Documentation

**Title:** Add Mermaid diagram for JWT token validation flow
**Priority:** Low
**Type:** Documentation Enhancement
**Related:** Issue #1174 (Resolved)

## Description

Following the successful resolution of Issue #1174 (Authentication Token Validation Failure), we should create visual documentation to help developers understand the JWT token validation flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Create Mermaid Diagram:** Visual flow showing complete JWT token validation process
2. **Document Edge Cases:** Include the edge cases that were fixed in Issue #1174
3. **Security Patterns:** Show security validation points and error handling paths
4. **Location:** Place in appropriate documentation location (suggested: `docs/auth/token_validation_flow.md`)

## Technical Details

The diagram should illustrate:
- Token reception and initial validation
- Timing precision handling (microsecond-level precision fixes)
- Required claims validation
- Error propagation and logging
- SSOT pattern with auth_service as sole JWT handler
- Silent failure prevention mechanisms

## Business Value

- **Segment:** Developer Experience
- **Business Goal:** Maintainability and team efficiency
- **Value Impact:** Reduces onboarding time for new developers working on auth
- **Strategic Impact:** Enables faster debugging and reduces auth-related support burden

## Implementation Approach

1. Review the implemented test cases from Issue #1174 resolution
2. Map the validation flow based on `auth_service/auth_core/core/token_validator.py`
3. Include error scenarios and recovery paths
4. Document the security considerations

## Priority Rationale

This is marked as **Low Priority** because:
- Issue #1174 is fully resolved with comprehensive tests
- The system is production-ready and secure
- This is a developer experience enhancement, not a functional requirement
- Can be completed in a future sprint when capacity allows

## Files to Reference

- `auth_service/auth_core/core/token_validator.py` (main implementation)
- `auth_service/tests/test_token_validation_security_cycles_31_35.py` (test scenarios)
- `ISSUE_UNTANGLE_1174_20250116_Claude.md` (comprehensive analysis)
- `MASTER_PLAN_ISSUE_1174_RESOLUTION.md` (resolution documentation)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Mermaid diagram created and reviewed
- [ ] Documentation includes all edge cases from Issue #1174
- [ ] Team can use diagram for debugging and onboarding
- [ ] Documentation is linked from main auth architecture docs
