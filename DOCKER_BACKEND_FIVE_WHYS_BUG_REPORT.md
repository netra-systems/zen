# Docker Backend Container - Five Whys Bug Analysis Report
Date: 2025-09-02
Environment: Development Docker Container

## Executive Summary
This report documents critical issues identified in the backend Docker container through Five Whys root cause analysis. Each issue impacts system stability, performance, or maintainability.

---

## Issue 1: High Memory Usage (87.80% of 1GB limit)

### Problem Statement
Backend container consistently uses 899.1MiB of its 1GB memory limit, creating OOM risk.

### Five Whys Analysis
1. **Why is memory usage at 87.80%?**
   - Because the container is running multiple Gunicorn workers with high baseline memory consumption
   
2. **Why are workers consuming so much memory?**
   - Because each worker loads the entire application context including all singleton services
   
3. **Why do singletons consume excessive memory?**
   - Because WebSocket bridges and agent registries maintain global state for all users
   
4. **Why is global state maintained?**
   - Because the system uses deprecated singleton patterns instead of request-scoped isolation
   
5. **Why aren't request-scoped patterns used?**
   - **ROOT CAUSE:** Legacy architecture wasn't designed for multi-tenant isolation

### Impact
- High risk of OOM kills under load
- Cannot scale horizontally effectively
- Memory leaks accumulate over time

### Recommended Fix
1. Implement request-scoped dependency injection
2. Migrate from singleton to per-user WebSocket emitters
3. Increase memory limit to 2GB as interim measure
4. Implement memory profiling and monitoring

## Issue 2: Deprecated WebSocket Implementation

### Problem Statement
Multiple deprecation warnings for websockets.legacy affecting 4+ components.

### Five Whys Analysis
1. **Why are deprecation warnings appearing?**
   - Because the system uses websockets.legacy which is deprecated in v14.0
   
2. **Why is legacy WebSocket code still used?**
   - Because Uvicorn's WebSocket implementation hasn't been updated
   
3. **Why hasn't the implementation been updated?**
   - Because it requires significant refactoring of WebSocket bridge architecture
   
4. **Why is refactoring complex?**
   - Because WebSocket state is tightly coupled with singleton patterns
   
5. **Why is tight coupling present?**
   - **ROOT CAUSE:** No abstraction layer between WebSocket protocol and business logic

### Impact
- Future breaking changes when websockets library removes legacy support
- Security vulnerabilities in deprecated code
- Performance degradation from legacy protocol handling

### Recommended Fix
1. Create WebSocket abstraction layer
2. Migrate to modern websockets implementation
3. Decouple WebSocket handling from business logic
4. Implement WebSocket connection pooling

---

## Issue 3: Incomplete Startup Fixes (4/5 Applied)

### Problem Statement
Startup sequence consistently reports "Only 4/5 startup fixes applied" warning.

### Five Whys Analysis
1. **Why are only 4/5 fixes applied?**
   - Because one startup fix consistently fails or is skipped
   
2. **Why does the fix fail?**
   - Because it depends on external services not yet initialized
   
3. **Why aren't services initialized?**
   - Because startup phases have race conditions
   
4. **Why do race conditions exist?**
   - Because there's no proper dependency graph for initialization
   
5. **Why is there no dependency graph?**
   - **ROOT CAUSE:** Startup sequence uses hardcoded phases instead of declarative dependencies

### Impact
- Unpredictable initialization state
- Potential missing functionality
- Difficult debugging of startup issues

### Recommended Fix
1. Implement declarative dependency graph
2. Add startup phase validation
3. Create retry logic for failed fixes
4. Add detailed logging for skipped fixes

## Issue 4: Singleton WebSocket Bridge Memory Leak Risk

### Problem Statement
AgentWebSocketBridge creates singleton that shares state between users with deprecation warnings.

### Five Whys Analysis
1. **Why is singleton pattern deprecated?**
   - Because it creates security and memory leak risks by sharing state
   
2. **Why does shared state cause issues?**
   - Because WebSocket events from one user can leak to another
   
3. **Why can events leak between users?**
   - Because there's no user context isolation in the bridge
   
4. **Why is isolation missing?**
   - Because the original design assumed single-user operation
   
5. **Why was single-user assumed?**
   - **ROOT CAUSE:** System architecture predates multi-tenant requirements

### Impact
- Security vulnerability: cross-user data leakage
- Memory leaks from accumulated event handlers
- Cannot safely serve multiple concurrent users

### Recommended Fix
1. Implement per-user WebSocket emitter factory
2. Add user context to all WebSocket operations
3. Create session-scoped WebSocket connections
4. Add memory cleanup on disconnect

---

## Issue 5: Schema Validation Warnings

### Problem Statement
Extra database tables not defined in models causing validation warnings.

### Five Whys Analysis
1. **Why are there extra tables?**
   - Because auth service creates tables not tracked by backend models
   
2. **Why aren't auth tables in backend models?**
   - Because services use separate database schemas
   
3. **Why do services share the same database?**
   - Because they weren't designed for microservice isolation
   
4. **Why isn't there proper isolation?**
   - Because the database architecture is monolithic
   
5. **Why is architecture monolithic?**
   - **ROOT CAUSE:** Services evolved from monolith without proper boundary definition

### Impact
- Schema drift between services
- Migration conflicts
- Difficulty tracking database changes

### Recommended Fix
1. Implement database schema namespacing
2. Create shared model definitions
3. Add cross-service schema validation
4. Consider database-per-service pattern

---

## Issue 6: Deprecated Agent Registry Pattern

### Problem Statement
AgentRegistry deprecated due to WebSocket state sharing between users.

### Five Whys Analysis
1. **Why is AgentRegistry deprecated?**
   - Because it maintains global state unsafe for multi-user operation
   
2. **Why does it maintain global state?**
   - Because agents are registered as singletons at startup
   
3. **Why are agents singletons?**
   - Because the factory pattern wasn't implemented initially
   
4. **Why wasn't factory pattern used?**
   - Because the system was designed for single-instance agents
   
5. **Why were single-instance agents assumed?**
   - **ROOT CAUSE:** Original requirements didn't include user isolation

### Impact
- Agent state corruption between users
- Cannot scale agent operations
- Memory accumulation from stale agents

### Recommended Fix
1. Implement AgentInstanceFactory
2. Create per-request agent instances
3. Add agent lifecycle management
4. Implement agent pooling for performance

---

## Issue 7: Missing ClickHouse Health Check Dependency

### Problem Statement
Backend starts before ClickHouse is confirmed healthy, causing connection errors.

### Five Whys Analysis
1. **Why does backend start early?**
   - Because ClickHouse health check wasn't in depends_on initially
   
2. **Why was it missing?**
   - Because ClickHouse was added after initial Docker setup
   
3. **Why wasn't dependency updated?**
   - Because there's no dependency validation process
   
4. **Why is validation missing?**
   - Because Docker Compose doesn't enforce runtime dependencies
   
5. **Why aren't dependencies enforced?**
   - **ROOT CAUSE:** No automated testing of service dependencies

### Impact
- Startup failures when ClickHouse is slow
- Connection pool exhaustion from retries
- Inconsistent analytics data

### Recommended Fix
1. Add ClickHouse to depends_on with health check
2. Implement connection retry with backoff
3. Add service dependency validation tests
4. Create startup dependency diagram
