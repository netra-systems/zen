## ðŸ”— Related Issues Linked to ExecutionEngine Module Missing

**Connecting Issue #915 to Related ExecutionEngine Issues:**

This issue is part of a broader SSOT ExecutionEngine consolidation effort. **Related Issues:**

- **Issue #909** - SSOT-regression-agent-execution-engine-multiplicity-blocking-golden-path
- **Issue #884** - SSOT-incomplete-migration-multiple-execution-engine-factories-blocking-ai-responses
- **Issue #859** - SSOT-incomplete-migration-Multiple Execution Engine Implementations Blocking Golden Path
- **Issue #835** - failing-test-active-dev-P2-deprecated-execution-factory

**Pattern Analysis:**
All these issues stem from the same root cause: **ExecutionEngine SSOT consolidation** where the old direct import paths were deprecated in favor of the new UserExecutionEngine with factory methods.

**Coordination Required:**
The 69 files needing import path updates in this issue should be coordinated with the broader SSOT consolidation tracked in the related issues above to prevent duplicate work and ensure complete migration.

**Priority Justification:**
P1 - High priority maintained because this directly impacts supervisor agent functionality and Golden Path user flows, with $500K+ ARR dependency on reliable execution engine operations.
