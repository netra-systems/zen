ISSUE_1=$(gh issue create \
    --title "🚨 P0: Fix WebSocket Manager async/await pattern violations in production" \
    --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Priority: P0 CRITICAL - Emergency Production Hotfix
**Timeline**: 24-48 hours
**Revenue Impact**: $500K+ ARR functionality affected

## Problem Statement
Production systems continue experiencing async/await pattern violations in WebSocket manager instantiation, despite documented resolution in #1184.

**Error**: `object _UnifiedWebSocketManagerImplementation can't be used in 'await' expression`

**Production Evidence**:
- GCP Logs: Error occurring as of 2025-09-15 12:26 IST
- Frequency: Multiple occurrences per hour in staging environment
- Affected Files:
  - `netra_backend.app.routes.websocket_ssot:1651`
  - `netra_backend.app.routes.websocket_ssot:954`

## Root Cause
```python
# INCORRECT (causing production failures)
manager = await get_websocket_manager(user_context=ctx)

# CORRECT (should be used instead)
manager = get_websocket_manager(user_context=ctx)
# OR
manager = await get_websocket_manager_async(user_context=ctx)
```

## Scope - EMERGENCY ONLY
- **IN SCOPE**: Direct pattern fixes to eliminate production errors
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: Architectural changes, test improvements, documentation updates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Zero production occurrences of `can't be used in 'await' expression` errors
- [ ] All instances of `await get_websocket_manager()` replaced with correct patterns
- [ ] Production staging environment stability confirmed
- [ ] No regression in existing WebSocket functionality

## Implementation Plan
1. **Audit Production Files**: Scan for `await get_websocket_manager()` patterns
2. **Pattern Replacement**: Replace with correct sync or async patterns
3. **Validation**: Test in staging environment
4. **Deployment**: Emergency production deployment if needed

## Business Impact
- **Golden Path**: Direct impact on users login → AI responses flow
- **Revenue**: $500K+ ARR functionality restoration
- **Customer Experience**: Elimination of WebSocket communication failures

## Related Issues
- Original Issue: #1184 (to be closed after decomposition)
- Architectural Follow-up: TBD (Phase 2)
- Test Alignment: TBD (Phase 3)
- Documentation: TBD (Phase 4)

# Phase 2: Create WebSocket Factory Simplification Issue (P1)
print_status "Creating Phase 2: WebSocket Factory Simplification Issue..."
ISSUE_2=$(gh issue create \
    --title "♻️ P1: Simplify WebSocket factory patterns and remove legacy implementations" \
    --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Priority: P1 - Architectural Cleanup
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Prerequisite**: Emergency hotfix from Phase 1 must be completed

## Problem Statement
WebSocket factory patterns have accumulated complexity through SSOT migration, creating developer confusion and maintenance burden.

**Current Issues**:
- Dual sync/async factory functions coexisting
- Legacy compatibility layers obscuring correct patterns
- 36+ import patterns consolidated but still complex
- Multiple WebSocket manager implementations

## Root Cause Analysis
From Issue #1184 investigation:
- **SSOT Migration Debt**: Extensive consolidation left complexity artifacts
- **Backward Compatibility**: Compatibility layers creating pattern confusion
- **Factory Pattern Evolution**: Multiple patterns introduced over time
- **Developer Confusion**: Unclear which pattern to use when

## Scope - Architectural Simplification
- **IN SCOPE**: Factory pattern unification and legacy removal
- **IN SCOPE**: Clear developer guidelines for WebSocket instantiation
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: Emergency production fixes (handled in Phase 1)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Single, clear WebSocket manager instantiation pattern
- [ ] Legacy factory patterns completely removed
- [ ] Developer documentation updated with clear usage examples
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] SSOT compliance improved (currently 98.7%)

## Implementation Plan
1. **Pattern Analysis**: Document all current factory patterns and usage
2. **Consolidation Strategy**: Design single, clear factory approach
3. **Legacy Removal**: Systematically eliminate deprecated patterns
4. **Migration Guide**: Create developer migration documentation
5. **Validation**: Comprehensive testing of unified pattern

## Technical Requirements
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Preserve multi-user isolation functionality
- Ensure async/await patterns are clearly distinguished
- Update all import patterns in canonical_import_patterns.py

## Success Metrics
- **Code Complexity**: Reduced cyclomatic complexity in WebSocket module
- **Developer Experience**: Clear, unambiguous instantiation patterns
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for WebSocket factory logic
- **Test Coverage**: All patterns covered by integration tests

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: Phase 1 emergency hotfix completed
- **Coordination**: Phase 3 test alignment for validation
- **Integration**: User context factory and authentication service

## Related Issues
- Emergency Fix: (Phase 1 issue)
- Test Alignment: TBD (Phase 3)
- Documentation: TBD (Phase 4)
- Original Issue: #1184

ISSUE_3=$(gh issue create \
    --title "🔧 P1: Align test environment async behavior with production WebSocket patterns" \
    --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Priority: P1 - Test Infrastructure
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Can run in parallel with Phase 2**

## Problem Statement
Critical disconnect exists between test validation and production behavior for WebSocket async/await patterns.

**Evidence**:
- Tests validate fixes that don't reflect production patterns
- Production failures occur despite comprehensive test suite passing
- 5/5 specialized tests reportedly passing while production shows errors
- Async/await patterns behave differently in test vs production environments

## Root Cause Analysis
From Issue #1184 investigation:
- **Environment Mismatch**: Test infrastructure doesn't replicate production async context
- **Mock Limitations**: Test mocks may not accurately represent production behavior
- **Async Context Differences**: Test runners vs production async event loop behavior
- **Validation Gap**: Tests pass but production patterns remain incorrect

## Scope - Test Infrastructure Improvement
- **IN SCOPE**: Test environment async behavior alignment
- **IN SCOPE**: Production pattern validation in test suite
- **IN SCOPE**: Enhanced WebSocket test utilities
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: Production code fixes (handled in Phase 1)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tests that pass locally also pass in production-like environments
- [ ] Test failures accurately predict production failures
- [ ] WebSocket async/await patterns validated in test environment
- [ ] No false positives in test validation
- [ ] Enhanced test coverage for production scenarios

## Implementation Plan
1. **Gap Analysis**: Compare test vs production async execution contexts
2. **Test Environment Enhancement**: Modify test infrastructure to match production
3. **Validation Improvement**: Add tests that detect async/await pattern violations
4. **Production Simulation**: Create test scenarios that replicate production conditions
5. **Regression Prevention**: Ensure future similar issues are caught by tests

## Technical Requirements
- Use real services in integration tests (no mocks for WebSocket validation)
- Replicate production async/await execution context in tests
- Add specific tests for `await get_websocket_manager()` pattern violations
- Validate WebSocket manager factory patterns in production-like scenarios

## Test Framework Integration
- Leverage existing `/test_framework/ssot/websocket_test_utility.py`
- Enhance unified test runner for production pattern validation
- Integrate with mission-critical test suite
- Use real WebSocket connections for validation

## Success Metrics
- **Test Accuracy**: Zero false positives in WebSocket pattern validation
- **Production Prediction**: Test failures accurately predict production issues
- **Developer Confidence**: Team confidence in test validation results
- **Regression Prevention**: Future async/await issues caught before production

## Dependencies
- **Test Framework**: Existing SSOT test infrastructure
- **WebSocket Utilities**: Production WebSocket manager patterns
- **Coordination**: Phase 1 for correct production patterns
- **Integration**: Phase 2 for simplified factory patterns

## Validation Plan
1. **Current Issue Reproduction**: Test should fail for known production patterns
2. **Fix Validation**: Test should pass after Phase 1 fixes
3. **Regression Testing**: Test should catch future similar issues
4. **Production Verification**: Test results should match production behavior

- Emergency Fix: (Phase 1 issue)
- Architecture: (Phase 2 issue)
- Documentation: TBD (Phase 4)
