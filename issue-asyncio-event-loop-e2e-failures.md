# Asyncio Event Loop Errors Causing E2E Test Failures

## Summary
E2E tests are failing with `RuntimeError: This event loop is already running` errors, preventing validation of critical business functionality worth $500K+ ARR.

## Description
Multiple E2E tests encounter asyncio event loop conflicts that prevent proper test execution. These failures block validation of:
- WebSocket golden path functionality
- Redis-WebSocket integration
- Agent execution pipelines
- User authentication flows

## Technical Details

### Error Pattern
```
RuntimeError: This event loop is already running
    at asyncio.run()
    at test execution framework
```

### Affected Tests
- E2E staging tests: 100% failure rate
- WebSocket event validation tests
- Agent orchestration tests
- Authentication journey tests

### Business Impact
- **Potential Revenue at Risk**: $500K+ ARR from chat functionality
- **Customer Impact**: Cannot validate production readiness
- **Development Velocity**: Blocks deployment confidence

### Evidence Files
- `STAGING_TEST_REPORT_PYTEST.md` - 0% pass rate on critical tests
- `tests/e2e/staging/test_gcp_redis_websocket_golden_path_simple.py` - All tests failing
- Asyncio-related learning files in `SPEC/learnings/asyncio_nested_loop_deadlock.xml`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] E2E tests run without asyncio event loop conflicts
- [ ] Test execution framework properly manages event loops
- [ ] Staging environment tests achieve >95% pass rate
- [ ] Golden path functionality validated end-to-end

## Priority
**Critical (P0)** - Blocks production deployment validation
