- Consider merging PR #436 after conflict resolution
- Maintain branch safety protocols

## Safety Protocol Notes
- **NEVER change branches during active work**
- **ALWAYS verify branch before major operations**
- **DOCUMENT all branch state changes**
- **MAINTAIN develop-long-lived as working branch**
