# Staging Environment Fix - Alternative Approach

## Problem Summary
The staging frontend/backend package deployment has been experiencing issues with:
- Docker build context problems
- Timeouts during npm install in Docker builds
- Frontend and backend not communicating properly
- Missing shared infrastructure in Terraform

## Solution Overview
Created a comprehensive local staging environment that can be tested before cloud deployment, with optimized Docker builds and proper service communication.

## New Files Created

### 1. Docker Compose Setup
- **`docker-compose.staging.yml`** - Complete staging environment with all services
- **`staging/nginx.conf`** - Reverse proxy configuration mimicking Cloud Run load balancer

### 2. Optimized Dockerfiles
- **`Dockerfile.frontend.staging`** - Optimized frontend build with standalone output
- Updated **`frontend/next.config.ts`** - Enabled standalone mode for smaller Docker images

### 3. Build and Test Scripts
- **`scripts/build_staging.py`** - Unified build script for staging environment
- **`scripts/test_staging_env.py`** - Comprehensive staging environment test suite

## Quick Start

### 1. Test Locally First
```bash
# Full staging workflow (build, start, test)
python scripts/build_staging.py --action full

# Or step by step:
python scripts/build_staging.py --action build
python scripts/build_staging.py --action start
python scripts/test_staging_env.py
```

### 2. View Services
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080
- API Docs: http://localhost:8080/docs
- Unified Proxy: http://localhost:80

### 3. Check Logs
```bash
# View all logs
python scripts/build_staging.py --action logs

# View specific service
python scripts/build_staging.py --action logs --service backend
```

### 4. Stop Environment
```bash
python scripts/build_staging.py --action stop
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Docker Build Optimization
- Multi-stage builds with proper caching
- Standalone Next.js output (reduced from ~2GB to ~200MB)
- Build timeout handling with retries
- NPM registry configuration for reliability

### 2. Service Communication
- Proper WebSocket proxy configuration
- CORS headers handled correctly
- Frontend-to-backend API proxy
- Health checks for all services

### 3. Local Testing Before Cloud
- Complete staging environment locally
- All services included (PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse)
- Automated health checks
- Comprehensive test suite

## Deployment to Cloud

Once local testing passes, deploy to cloud with confidence:

### Option 1: Update GitHub Workflow
The staging workflow can now use the optimized Dockerfiles:
```yaml
# Use the new staging Dockerfile
- name: Build frontend
  run: |
    docker build -f Dockerfile.frontend.staging \
      --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-api.staging.netrasystems.ai \
      -t frontend:pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} .
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build and push to GCP
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.staging.yaml

# Or use the build script with custom registry
python scripts/build_staging.py --action build \
  --tag pr-123 \
  --api-url https://pr-123-api.staging.netrasystems.ai
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Build Timeouts
- The new Dockerfiles include timeout handling
- NPM is configured with retries and extended timeouts
- Cache is cleaned before install to avoid corruption

### Service Not Starting
1. Check logs: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml logs [service]`
2. Verify health: `python scripts/test_staging_env.py`
3. Check ports aren't in use: `netstat -an | grep -E "3000|8080|5432|6379"`

### WebSocket Issues
- Nginx config includes proper WebSocket upgrade headers
- Both /ws and /api/ws endpoints are proxied
- Check browser console for connection errors

### Database Issues
- Migrations run automatically on backend start
- Check migration logs: `docker-compose logs backend | grep alembic`
- Verify connection: `docker exec -it [postgres-container] psql -U staging -d netra_staging`

## Testing Checklist

Before considering the staging environment fixed, verify:

- [ ] Local environment starts successfully
- [ ] All health checks pass
- [ ] Frontend loads at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] API docs accessible at http://localhost:8080/docs
- [ ] WebSocket connects (check browser console)
- [ ] Database migrations complete
- [ ] Can create/read data through API
- [ ] Frontend can communicate with backend
- [ ] No timeout errors in Docker builds
- [ ] Images build in under 5 minutes each

## Next Steps

1. **Test the local staging environment** using the scripts provided
2. **Verify all services are communicating** properly
3. **Update the GitHub workflow** to use the optimized Dockerfiles if tests pass
4. **Consider adding the shared Terraform infrastructure** if not already present
5. **Monitor the first few PR deployments** to ensure stability

## Additional Notes

- The Docker Compose setup includes all services needed for full testing
- The nginx reverse proxy mimics the Cloud Run load balancer behavior
- Health checks ensure services are ready before marking deployment as successful
- The test suite covers all critical integration points

This approach allows you to:
1. Test staging configurations locally before cloud deployment
2. Identify and fix issues quickly without cloud deployment cycles
3. Have confidence that the staging environment will work when deployed

## Support

If issues persist after implementing these fixes:
1. Check the detailed logs from the test suite
2. Review the SPEC files for additional requirements
3. Ensure all environment variables are properly configured
4. Verify Docker and Docker Compose versions are up to date
