## Issue Summary

**Primary Problem**: HTTP 503 Service Unavailable errors on health endpoints with high latency (10+ seconds), causing critical staging infrastructure health check failures.

## Evidence Gathered

### Service Status
- **Backend Service**: `/health/ready` endpoint consistently timing out after 10+ seconds
- **Auth Service**: Multiple 503 error patterns in staging environment
- **All staging services**: Returning HTTP 503 errors across `*.netrasystems.ai` domains

### Root Cause Analysis from Existing Documentation

**Issue #137 (Previous Analysis)**:
- Backend `/health/ready` endpoint timeout due to WebSocket Redis validation timeout (30s â†’ fixed to 3s)
- Status: Previously fixed but may have regressed

**Current Evidence (September 16, 2025)**:
- Complete staging infrastructure failure
- All GCP staging services returning HTTP 503
- Related to Issue #1278 VPC Connector capacity constraints

### Technical Details

**Health Endpoint Configuration**:
- Basic `/health` responds normally (0.15s)
- Database health check responds normally (0.17s)
- `/health/ready` times out (suggests readiness check logic issue)

**Timeout Configuration Issues**:
- GCP WebSocket readiness check: 30.0s default timeout
- Redis validation in staging: Extended timeouts causing cascade failures
- Sequential validation blocking (not parallel)

**Infrastructure Components Affected**:
1. Cloud Run Services - HTTP 503 responses
2. VPC Connector (`staging-connector`) - capacity/connectivity issues
3. Load Balancer - health checks failing
4. SSL Certificates - validation for `*.netrasystems.ai` domains

## Impact Assessment

**Business Impact**:
- Complete staging environment failure (0% availability)
- E2E agent tests blocked
- Golden Path user flow validation impossible

**Technical Impact**:
- Readiness probe failures causing container restarts
- Load balancer marking services as unhealthy
- Cascade failures to dependent services

## Log Patterns Identified

```
503 Service Unavailable
Health endpoint timeout (10s+)
Request timeout on /health/ready
VPC connector capacity constraints
Redis connection validation delays
```

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Infrastructure Investigation**: Check Cloud Run service health and VPC connector status
2. **Service Restart**: Restart affected staging services if resource exhaustion detected
3. **Timeout Configuration**: Review and adjust health check timeouts
4. **VPC Connector**: Validate capacity and scale if needed
5. **SSL Certificates**: Ensure valid certificates for staging domains

## Related Issues

- **Issue #137**: Backend health/ready timeout (previously fixed)
- **Issue #1278**: VPC Connector capacity constraints (P0 Emergency)
- **CLUSTER 1**: Missing monitoring module causing startup failures
- **CLUSTER 2**: Health check failures as symptoms

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All staging services return HTTP 200 for health checks
- [ ] Health endpoint response times < 10 seconds
- [ ] WebSocket connections establish successfully
- [ ] E2E tests can connect to staging infrastructure
- [ ] No HTTP 503 errors on critical endpoints
