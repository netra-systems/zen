### SSOT Compliance Achievements
```json
{
  "compliance_score": "98.7%",
  "real_system_compliance": "100.0% (866 files)",
  "test_files_compliance": "96.2% (293 files)",
  "total_violations": 15,
  "improvement": "+88.7% from baseline"
}
```

### WebSocket SSOT Consolidation Phase 1
- **Canonical Import Patterns**: Established single source of truth for WebSocket manager imports
- **Logging Standardization**: Applied unified logging patterns across WebSocket core components
- **Backwards Compatibility**: All legacy imports preserved with proper deprecation warnings
- **Import Chain Validation**: All new SSOT imports functional with no circular dependencies

## Infrastructure Analysis & Five Whys

### Root Cause Analysis: Staging Infrastructure Failure
1. **Why are E2E tests failing?** → Staging services returning HTTP 503 errors
2. **Why are services returning HTTP 503?** → GCP Cloud Run services unable to handle requests
3. **Why can't Cloud Run handle requests?** → VPC connector capacity/configuration issues
4. **Why are VPC connector issues occurring?** → Infrastructure capacity planning for database connectivity
5. **Why is database connectivity affected?** → Staging environment resource allocation and configuration drift

### Infrastructure Remediation Requirements
- **Immediate (P0)**: VPC connector capacity investigation and expansion
- **High Priority (P1)**: Load balancer health check configuration optimization
- **Medium Priority (P2)**: Database connection timeout adjustments (600s requirement)
- **Monitoring (P3)**: Enhanced infrastructure health monitoring and alerting
