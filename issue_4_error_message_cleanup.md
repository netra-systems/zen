# Clean Up Misleading Error Messages and Improve Error Attribution

## Problem Statement

Issue #1029 was significantly complicated by misleading error messages that pointed to infrastructure problems ("Redis connectivity failure") when the actual issue was an application-level circular dependency. This led to hours of misdirected debugging effort and investigation of working infrastructure.

## Background

The analysis revealed a systematic problem with error message quality:
- Timeout errors manifest as connectivity failures
- Error messages focus on symptoms rather than root causes
- No distinction between infrastructure vs application errors
- Missing contextual information about what was being attempted when the error occurred

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Symptom-Based Reporting**: Errors report the timeout symptom, not the underlying cause
2. **Poor Error Propagation**: Lower-level infrastructure errors bubble up without context
3. **Missing Categorization**: No systematic way to distinguish error types
4. **Insufficient Context**: Errors don't include information about the operation being performed

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Error Message Audit
- [ ] Audit all startup-related error messages across the system
- [ ] Categorize existing errors by type (Infrastructure, Application, Configuration)
- [ ] Identify patterns where timeouts are reported as connectivity issues
- [ ] Document correlation between error messages and actual root causes

### Phase 2: Error Classification System
- [ ] Implement error categorization system with clear types:
  - `INFRASTRUCTURE`: Actual connectivity, resource, or deployment issues
  - `APPLICATION`: Logic errors, circular dependencies, configuration conflicts
  - `CONFIGURATION`: Missing or invalid configuration values
  - `DEPENDENCY`: Service dependency issues or version mismatches
- [ ] Add error severity levels (CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO)
- [ ] Include operation context in all error messages

### Phase 3: Specific Error Message Improvements
- [ ] Replace "Redis connectivity failure" with specific circular dependency error when applicable
- [ ] Add timeout context: "Validation timed out waiting for [specific dependency]"
- [ ] Include suggested resolution steps in error messages
- [ ] Add error codes for programmatic handling and documentation lookup

### Phase 4: Error Handling Infrastructure
- [ ] Create centralized error formatting with consistent structure
- [ ] Add error correlation IDs for tracking across services
- [ ] Implement error aggregation to prevent log spam from repeated issues
- [ ] Add structured logging for better error analysis

## Technical Requirements

1. **Accuracy**: Error messages must accurately reflect the actual problem
2. **Actionability**: Each error must include specific steps for resolution
3. **Context**: Errors must include relevant operational context
4. **Consistency**: All errors follow same formatting and categorization standards
5. **Performance**: Error handling improvements must not impact normal operation performance

## Deliverables

1. **Error Classification Framework** (`/shared/errors/error_types.py`)
   ```python
   class ErrorType(Enum):
       INFRASTRUCTURE = "infrastructure"
       APPLICATION = "application"
       CONFIGURATION = "configuration"
       DEPENDENCY = "dependency"

   class StructuredError:
       type: ErrorType
       severity: ErrorSeverity
       message: str
       context: Dict[str, Any]
       resolution_steps: List[str]
       error_code: str
   ```

2. **Enhanced Error Messages** (across validation files)
   - Replace generic timeout messages with specific operational context
   - Add resolution suggestions based on error type
   - Include debugging information for complex issues

3. **Error Documentation** (`docs/troubleshooting/error_codes.md`)
   - Comprehensive list of error codes and their meanings
   - Resolution procedures for each error type
   - Escalation paths for different error categories

4. **Validation Error Improvements** (specific to issue #1029 context)
   - Replace "Redis connectivity failure" with "Circular dependency detected in validation chain"
   - Add context about which validations are creating the cycle
   - Include specific steps to resolve circular dependencies

## Implementation Examples

### Before (Misleading)
```
ERROR: Redis connectivity failure - service startup aborted
```

### After (Accurate and Actionable)
```
ERROR [APPLICATION/CIRCULAR_DEPENDENCY]: Circular dependency detected in startup validation
Context: WebSocket validation waiting for Redis, Redis validation waiting for WebSocket
Resolution: Review validation dependencies in startup sequence
Error Code: APP_001
Correlation ID: startup-123abc
```

## Success Metrics

- **Accuracy**: 95% of developers can identify correct error category within 1 minute
- **Resolution Time**: 60% reduction in time from error to correct solution
- **Misdirection**: Zero instances of infrastructure investigation for application errors
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Improved error helpfulness rating in developer surveys

## Priority

**Medium Priority** - Important for developer experience and reducing debugging time, but not blocking current functionality.

## Estimated Effort

**2-3 days** - Requires systematic review and updating of error messages across the codebase.
