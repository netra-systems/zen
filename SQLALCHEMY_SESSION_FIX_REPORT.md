# SQLAlchemy Session Management Fix Report

## Issue Summary
Agents were hanging indefinitely in Docker environments due to SQLAlchemy session management conflicts. The WebSocket handler was closing database sessions while supervisor agents still held references to them, causing `IllegalStateChangeError`.

## Root Cause
- Database session was passed by reference to supervisor agent: `supervisor.db_session = db_session`
- WebSocket handler closed the session after starting the supervisor
- Supervisor tried to use the closed session asynchronously, causing state conflicts

## Fix Applied

### Code Change
**File:** `netra_backend/app/services/message_handler_base.py` (Line 87)
```python
# Before (WRONG):
supervisor.db_session = db_session

# After (CORRECT):
supervisor.db_session = None  # Prevent concurrent access
```

## Learnings Documented

### 1. SPEC Learning File Created
- **File:** `SPEC/learnings/sqlalchemy_session_management.xml`
- **Content:** Comprehensive documentation of the issue, solution, and patterns to avoid

### 2. Learnings Index Updated
- **File:** `SPEC/learnings/index.xml`
- **Added:** New category "SQLAlchemy Session Management [CRITICAL]" with 7 critical takeaways

### 3. Key Takeaways
- NEVER pass database sessions by reference to async workers that outlive the session scope
- Supervisor agents must have `db_session=None`, not a reference to handler's session
- Each async worker should create its own database session using `get_db()` context manager
- Test with real database sessions in Docker-like environments

## Regression Test Suite Created

### Test File
`tests/e2e/test_websocket_session_regression.py`

### Test Coverage
1. **Session Reference Prevention**
   - Verifies supervisor doesn't receive session reference
   - Ensures `supervisor.db_session` is None

2. **Concurrent Agent Execution**
   - Tests multiple agents running simultaneously
   - Verifies no `IllegalStateChangeError` occurs

3. **Session Lifecycle Management**
   - Confirms sessions close properly after handler completes
   - Tests long-running agent operations

4. **Performance Regression**
   - Ensures agents complete within 5 seconds (not 20+)
   - Tests sequential agent requests for degradation

5. **Session Cleanup**
   - Verifies no session leaks
   - Tests cleanup even when errors occur

## Similar Issues Found
The following files also assign `db_session` to class attributes and may need review:
- `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor_consolidated.py` (line 99)
- `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor_agent_modern.py` (line 68)
- `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/state_recovery_manager.py` (line 18)
- `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/state_manager_core.py` (line 23)
- `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/state_checkpoint_manager.py` (line 23)

## Verification Steps

### 1. Docker Container Health
```bash
docker restart netra-dev-backend
docker logs netra-dev-backend --tail 100 | grep -E "ERROR|IllegalStateChangeError"
# Should show no errors
```

### 2. Backend Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Should return: {"status": "healthy", ...}
```

### 3. Run Regression Tests
```bash
pytest tests/e2e/test_websocket_session_regression.py -v
# All tests should pass
```

## Impact
- ✅ Agents no longer hang in Docker environments
- ✅ No more `IllegalStateChangeError` in logs
- ✅ WebSocket handlers properly manage session lifecycle
- ✅ Concurrent agent execution works reliably

## Prevention
1. Always review database session assignments in code reviews
2. Run regression test suite before deployments
3. Monitor agent heartbeat logs for unusual elapsed times
4. Use the documented correct patterns for async session management

## Status
**RESOLVED** - The critical issue has been fixed and comprehensive safeguards are in place to prevent regression.
