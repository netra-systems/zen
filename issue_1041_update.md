üö® UPDATED TEST FAILURE EVIDENCE - Golden Path Unit Tests

## Current Test Execution Summary
**Test Suite:** Golden Path Business Value Protection Tests
**Collection Status:** ‚úÖ 3 tests collected (NO collection failure in this suite)
**Execution Status:** ‚ùå 2 tests failed, 1 test status unknown
**Last Run:** 2025-09-15

## Specific Failing Tests

### 1. test_golden_path_execution_flow_traceable
**Error:** Phase coverage 0.00% below required 70%
**Details:**
```
AssertionError: GOLDEN PATH VISIBILITY INSUFFICIENT: Phase coverage 0.00% is below required 70% for effective customer support. Tracked phases: []. Missing visibility into {'context_validated', 'execution_tracked', 'processing_started', 'agent_initialized', 'completion_attempted', 'execution_started'}. Enterprise customers need complete execution flow visibility for issue resolution.
```

### 2. test_business_impact_of_logging_disconnection
**Error:** SSOT logging improvement 0.00% below required 30%
**Details:**
```
AssertionError: INSUFFICIENT BUSINESS VALUE: SSOT logging improvement 0.00% is below required 30% for ROI justification. Mixed correlation rate: 0.00%, Unified correlation rate: 0.00%. SSOT remediation must provide measurable business value for $500,000 ARR protection.
```

## Connection to Existing Collection Issue

**CRITICAL FINDING:** While these specific golden path tests DO collect properly (3 tests collected), the broader pattern described in issue #1041 affects other test directories:

- ‚úÖ `tests/unit/golden_path/` - 3 tests collected successfully
- ‚ùå Most other `tests/unit/golden_path/` files show "collected 0 items" pattern
- ‚ùå E2E tests show: `collected 0 items / 1 error` (as seen in e2e_test_results_1757820986.json)

This suggests the pytest collection failures are **directory-specific** rather than universal, with some golden path tests collecting but failing at execution level.

## Business Impact Assessment

**$500,000 ARR Protection at Risk:**
- Golden Path execution flow visibility: 0% (below 70% requirement)
- Customer support correlation tracking: 0% (below required thresholds)
- Business value measurement capability: COMPROMISED

**Test Infrastructure Status:**
- Core collection works for main golden path suite
- Test execution logic fails due to mock/correlation context issues
- Legacy/deprecated imports causing warnings but not blocking execution

## Error Pattern Analysis

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Mock Configuration Issues:** Test mocks not properly capturing correlation context
2. **Phase Tracking Logic:** Expected phases not being matched in log messages
3. **Correlation Propagation:** 0% correlation rates indicate logging context not propagating
4. **SSOT Migration Incomplete:** Mixed logging patterns still present

## Recommended Next Steps

**Immediate (P1):**
1. Fix mock setup in golden path tests to properly capture correlation IDs
2. Review phase tracking logic in `_simulate_golden_path_phases()` method
3. Investigate correlation context propagation in test environment

**Medium-term (P2):**
1. Complete SSOT logging migration to resolve correlation tracking
2. Investigate collection failures in other test directories
3. Address deprecation warnings from legacy import paths

**Monitoring:**
1. Track golden path test execution success rate
2. Monitor business value protection metrics
3. Validate correlation tracking improvements post-SSOT remediation

**Test Evidence Generated:** 2025-09-15
**Tags:** actively-being-worked-on, golden-path-tests, collection-issue-partial

**Note:** This represents a **partial manifestation** of the collection issue - some tests collect successfully but fail at execution, while others fail at collection entirely. The problem appears to have multiple layers requiring targeted fixes.
