- **Status**: FAILED due to timeout (5 minutes)
- **Tests Collected**: 25 items
- **Test Status**: Partial execution with failures
- **Execution Time**: 5m 0.0s (TIMEOUT)

**Failed Tests**:
1. `test_001_websocket_connection_real` - FAILED
2. `test_002_websocket_authentication_real` - FAILED  
3. `test_003_websocket_message_send_real` - FAILED
4. `test_005_agent_discovery_real` - FAILED
5. `test_007_agent_execution_endpoints_real` - FAILED

**Passed Tests**:
1. `test_004_websocket_concurrent_connections_real` - PASSED
2. `test_006_agent_configuration_real` - PASSED
3. `test_008_agent_streaming_capabilities_real` - PASSED
4. `test_009_agent_status_monitoring_real` - PASSED
5. `test_010_tool_execution_endpoints_real` - PASSED

**AUTHENTICATION NOTE**: Test output shows staging user being used:
```
[STAGING AUTH FIX] Using EXISTING staging user: staging-e2e-user-001
[STAGING AUTH FIX] This user should exist in staging database
```

### Test Run 2: Critical Path Tests (`test_10_critical_path_staging.py`)

**Command**: `python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_10_critical_path_staging.py -v --tb=short -x`

**ACTUAL OUTPUT**:
- **Status**: ALL SKIPPED
- **Tests Collected**: 6 items
- **Skip Reason**: "Staging environment is not available"
- **Execution Time**: 29.16s
- **Memory Usage**: 121.8 MB

**Skipped Tests**:
1. `test_basic_functionality` - SKIPPED
2. `test_critical_api_endpoints` - SKIPPED
3. `test_end_to_end_message_flow` - SKIPPED (**CRITICAL FOR BUSINESS VALUE**)
4. `test_critical_performance_targets` - SKIPPED
5. `test_critical_error_handling` - SKIPPED
6. `test_business_critical_features` - SKIPPED (**CRITICAL FOR BUSINESS VALUE**)

### Root Cause Analysis: Staging Environment Accessibility

**Command**: Direct health check against staging
```python
config_url = 'https://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/health'
```

**ACTUAL RESULT**:
- **Status**: FAILED
- **Error**: "The read operation timed out"
- **Staging Available**: False
- **Implication**: Staging environment is DOWN or INACCESSIBLE

## VALIDATION OF TEST EXECUTION

### Real vs Fake Test Verification

**Evidence of Real Test Execution**:
1. ‚úÖ **Real Time Execution**: Test runs took 29.16s and 5m+ respectively - NOT 0.00s
2. ‚úÖ **Real Network Calls**: Timeout errors indicate actual network attempts to staging
3. ‚úÖ **Real Authentication**: JWT token creation with staging users attempted
4. ‚úÖ **Real Environment Setup**: Test session started with proper metadata
5. ‚úÖ **Real Memory Usage**: 121.8 MB memory consumption indicates real execution

**NOT Fake Tests Because**:
- Tests attempted real network connections to staging.netrasystems.ai
- JWT authentication processes executed for staging users  
- Real timeouts occurred from network calls
- Memory consumption and execution time prove real execution

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Primary Issue: STAGING ENVIRONMENT DOWN
- **Root Cause**: Staging GCP environment is inaccessible
- **Impact**: Cannot validate end-to-end business value flow
- **Business Risk**: Cannot prove user prompt to report works
- **Next Action Required**: Deploy/restart staging environment

### Secondary Issues
1. **Authentication Complex**: Tests using existing staging users but still failing auth
2. **WebSocket Failures**: Core WebSocket functionality failing in staging
3. **Agent Execution Failures**: Agent discovery and execution endpoints failing

## FIVE WHYS ANALYSIS FOR ROOT CAUSE

**Why is the end-to-end business value test failing?**
1. Because staging environment is not accessible

**Why is staging environment not accessible?** 
2. Because health check at `https://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/health` times out

**Why does the health check timeout?**
3. Because the staging GCP service is either down, not deployed, or networking is broken

**Why is the staging service potentially down?**
4. Because there may not have been a recent deployment to staging environment

**Why hasn't there been a recent deployment?**
5. Because the ultimate-test-deploy-loop process requires deployment as part of the cycle

## REQUIRED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. **DEPLOY TO STAGING**: Use deployment script to get staging environment operational
2. **VERIFY HEALTH**: Confirm staging health endpoints respond  
3. **RE-RUN TESTS**: Execute the same test suite against working staging
4. **DOCUMENT RESULTS**: Capture actual passing test output
5. **FIX FAILURES**: Address any remaining test failures with bug fix process

## COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS

- ‚úÖ **Step 1 Complete**: Ran real e2e staging tests with focus on business value
- ‚úÖ **Step 2 In Progress**: Documented ACTUAL test output (this report)  
- ‚ùå **Tests Failed**: Due to staging environment accessibility
- üîÑ **Next**: Deploy staging environment and repeat cycle

## EVIDENCE SUMMARY

This report provides PROOF of real test execution:
- **Real network timeouts**: Not mocked
- **Real authentication attempts**: JWT creation and validation
- **Real execution time**: 29.16s and 5m+ (not instant)
- **Real memory usage**: 121.8 MB consumption
- **Real environment targeting**: staging.netrasystems.ai endpoints

**CONCLUSION**: Tests are REAL but staging environment is DOWN. Must deploy and repeat cycle.
