- **User Experience:** Potential for hung sessions or incomplete AI interactions

### üíº $500K+ ARR Impact:
- **RISK:** Timeout issues could affect core chat functionality (90% of platform value)
- **MITIGATION NEEDED:** Agent execution pipeline optimization required
- **MONITORING:** Real-time performance tracking essential for production readiness

## Technical Root Cause Analysis

### Agent Execution Timeout Pattern:
```
WebSocket Connection ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Agent Request ‚Üí [TIMEOUT @ 15s]
```

### Potential Causes:
1. **Redis/PostgreSQL Latency:** Database operations taking longer than expected
2. **AI Model Response Time:** LLM calls exceeding timeout thresholds
3. **Resource Constraints:** Memory/CPU limitations in GCP staging environment
4. **Network Latency:** Communication delays between services

### Infrastructure Dependencies:
- **Redis:** Connection to `10.166.204.83:6379` (VPC internal)
- **PostgreSQL:** Database queries potentially taking 5+ seconds
- **LLM APIs:** External AI service calls with variable response times

## Recommendations

### üö® IMMEDIATE (Critical for Business Value):
