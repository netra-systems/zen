## 6. Root Cause Analysis

### Five Whys Summary

**Primary Question:** Why is the Golden Path blocked?

1. **Why are critical services not running?**
   - Service orchestration gaps in development environment

2. **Why do we have JWT configuration drift?**
   - Configuration management not enforced across services

3. **Why is WebSocket functionality untested?**
   - Missing test strategy for real-time components

4. **Why are database models failing?**
   - Data model inconsistency in auth layer

5. **Why are test fixtures missing?**
   - Incomplete dependency injection in test framework

### Systemic Issues Identified
- **Service Orchestration:** Development environment setup incomplete
- **Configuration Management:** Drift between services not detected
- **Test Strategy:** Gap in WebSocket and real-time testing
- **Dependency Management:** Missing fixtures and service dependencies

## 11. Stakeholder Communication

### For Engineering Leadership
- **Priority:** Immediate focus on P0 blockers required
- **Resources:** Recommend full team allocation to service availability
- **Timeline:** 2-3 days minimum to achieve basic operational state

### For Product Management
- **Customer Impact:** Chat functionality (primary value delivery) unverified
- **Demo Risk:** Sales demonstrations may fail due to infrastructure issues
- **Revenue Risk:** $500K+ ARR dependent on resolving these issues

### For Business Leadership
- **Executive Summary:** System architecture excellent but runtime infrastructure needs immediate attention
- **Business Continuity:** Critical path to customer value delivery blocked
- **Investment Need:** Short-term intensive focus to resolve infrastructure gaps

---

## 12. Conclusion

The Netra Apex platform demonstrates exceptional architectural quality with 98.7% SSOT compliance, indicating excellent engineering practices and design decisions. However, critical runtime infrastructure gaps prevent the system from delivering its core business value.

The primary blocker is service availability (auth service not running), which cascades to prevent validation of all other system components. With focused effort on the 6 P0 issues identified, the system can be restored to operational status within 2-3 days.

The quality of the underlying architecture provides confidence that once these infrastructure issues are resolved, the system will perform reliably and deliver the intended business value.

**Next Immediate Action:** Start auth service on port 8081 and begin systematic resolution of P0 blockers in priority order.
