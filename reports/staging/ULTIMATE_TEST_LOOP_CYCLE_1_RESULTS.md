# Ultimate Test-Deploy Loop - Cycle 1 Results
**Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Focus**: P0 Critical Tests  
**Environment**: Staging (GCP)  
**Status**: FAILING - WebSocket 1011 Internal Errors

## Executive Summary
- **HTTP Connectivity**: ✅ PASSING - Staging backend accessible at https://api.staging.netrasystems.ai
- **WebSocket Connectivity**: ❌ FAILING - Consistent 1011 internal errors
- **Critical Issue**: All P0 tests dependent on WebSocket connections are failing
- **Business Impact**: $120K+ MRR at risk due to core platform functionality failures

## Test Results Summary

### Connectivity Tests
| Test | Status | Duration | Result |
|------|--------|----------|--------|
| HTTP Health Check | ✅ PASS | 0.824s | Service healthy, version 1.0.0 |
| WebSocket Connect | ❌ FAIL | 0.830s | 1011 internal error |
| Agent Pipeline | ❌ FAIL | 0.818s | 1011 internal error |

**Success Rate**: 33.3% (1/3 tests passing)

### Core Staging Tests (WebSocket Events)
| Test | Status | Duration | Error Details |
|------|--------|----------|---------------|
| Health Check | ❌ FAIL | - | WebSocket connection failure |
| WebSocket Connection | ❌ FAIL | - | received 1011 (internal error) Internal error |
| API Endpoints | ✅ PASS | - | Service discovery, MCP config working |
| WebSocket Event Flow | ❌ FAIL | - | Connection successful, then 1011 error |

**Success Rate**: 25% (1/4 tests passing)

## Critical Findings

### 1. Consistent WebSocket 1011 Errors
**Pattern**: All WebSocket connections initially succeed but immediately fail with:
```
received 1011 (internal error) Internal error; then sent 1011 (internal error) Internal error
```

### 2. Authentication Working
**Positive**: Authentication flows are working correctly:
- JWT tokens are being created successfully
- SSOT auth helper working with staging users
- E2E test detection headers are present
- No 403 authentication errors observed

### 3. HTTP Services Healthy
**Positive**: REST API endpoints are functioning:
- Health check returns 200 OK
- Service discovery working
- MCP configuration accessible
- Backend version 1.0.0 deployed

## Root Cause Analysis Required

### Why #1: Why are WebSocket connections failing?
**Answer**: WebSocket connections succeed initially but immediately close with 1011 internal error

### Why #2: Why do connections close after successful authentication?
**Needs Investigation**: 
- Are there WebSocket event handlers crashing?
- Is there a server-side error after authentication?
- Are there missing dependencies or configurations?

### Why #3: Why is the error code 1011 specifically?
**1011 Meaning**: "Server terminating connection because it encountered an unexpected condition"
**Investigation Needed**: Server-side logs required to identify the unexpected condition

### Why #4: Why does HTTP work but WebSocket doesn't?
**Hypothesis**: Different code paths - WebSocket involves additional event handling, agent routing, or state management that HTTP endpoints don't use

### Why #5: Why is this affecting all WebSocket operations?
**Hypothesis**: Systematic issue in WebSocket connection handler, event loop, or core WebSocket infrastructure

## Next Actions Required

1. **Review GCP Staging Logs** - Critical to identify server-side errors
2. **Five Whys Analysis** - Deploy multi-agent team to investigate root cause
3. **WebSocket Handler Inspection** - Check server-side WebSocket connection handling
4. **Event Loop Analysis** - Verify WebSocket event processing is not crashing
5. **Configuration Review** - Ensure all staging environment variables and dependencies are correct

## Service Status Check Needed

Before proceeding with fixes, need to verify:
- [ ] GCP staging service is fully deployed and running
- [ ] All environment variables are properly configured  
- [ ] Database connections are working
- [ ] WebSocket event handlers are not crashing
- [ ] No dependency issues in staging environment

## Business Impact Assessment

**Immediate Risk**: $120K+ MRR at risk
- Core platform functionality (WebSocket-based chat) is completely broken
- Users cannot interact with agents through the web UI
- All real-time features are non-functional

**Timeline Critical**: This must be resolved before any release or customer demos.

**Next Step**: Deploy multi-agent five whys analysis team to investigate WebSocket 1011 errors with GCP staging logs review.
