# Five Whys Root Cause Analysis: Authentication 403 Errors in Staging

**Date**: September 8, 2025  
**Time**: [Current Time] GMT  
**Impact**: P1 CRITICAL - Tests getting 403 Forbidden errors despite valid JWT tokens  
**Business Impact**: $120K+ MRR at risk - Blocking staging environment validation  

## Executive Summary

Tests in staging environment are receiving HTTP 403 Forbidden errors on endpoints like `/api/chat/stream` and `/api/chat/messages` despite creating JWT tokens for existing staging user "staging-e2e-user-001". The tests show "SUCCESS: Created staging JWT for EXISTING user" but subsequent API calls fail with 403 errors. This analysis identifies the root cause as **inconsistent JWT secret usage between test token creation and staging backend validation**.

## Error Analysis

### Primary Error Pattern
```
POST /api/chat/stream: 403 (content_length: 257)
/api/chat/messages: 403 errors consistently
JWT tokens created for: "staging-e2e-user-001" 
Status: "SUCCESS: Created staging JWT for EXISTING user"
Result: HTTP 403 Forbidden on API calls
```

## Five Whys Analysis

### **Why #1: Why are valid JWT tokens getting rejected with 403 Forbidden errors?**

**Answer**: The JWT tokens created by the test framework are being rejected during API endpoint authentication validation, even though the same user exists and token creation appears successful.

**Evidence**:
- **File**: `C:\Users\antho\OneDrive\Desktop\Netra\netra-core-generation-1\netra_backend\app\routes\utils\websocket_helpers.py` (Lines 46-60)
- Tests show "Created staging JWT for EXISTING user: staging-e2e-user-001" 
- Same tokens immediately fail with 403 on `/api/chat/stream` and `/api/chat/messages`
- WebSocket authentication logic shows HTTPException 403 being raised for "Invalid or expired token"

### **Why #2: Why are the JWT tokens being marked as invalid or expired?**

**Answer**: The JWT tokens are being rejected during the `auth_client.validate_token_jwt()` validation process in the backend authentication middleware, indicating a JWT signature or format validation failure.

**Evidence**:
- **File**: `C:\Users\antho\OneDrive\Desktop\Netra\netra-core-generation-1\netra_backend\app\routes\utils\websocket_helpers.py` (Lines 47-53)
- **Code Analysis**:
  ```python
  validation_result = await auth_client.validate_token_jwt(token)
  if not validation_result or not validation_result.get("valid"):
      logger.error("[WS AUTH] Token validation failed: invalid token from auth service")
      raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Invalid or expired token")
  ```
- **File**: `C:\Users\antho\OneDrive\Desktop\Netra\netra-core-generation-1\netra_backend\app\clients\auth_client_core.py` (Lines 700-705)
- Auth service validation is the canonical validation point for all JWT tokens

### **Why #3: Why is the auth service JWT validation failing for staging test tokens?**

**Answer**: The JWT tokens created by the E2E test framework are using a different JWT secret than the staging backend expects, causing signature validation to fail at the auth service level.

**Evidence from Code Analysis**:
- **File**: `C:\Users\antho\OneDrive\Desktop\Netra\netra-core-generation-1\test_framework\ssot\e2e_auth_helper.py` (Lines 420-425)
- **E2E Token Creation Secret Resolution**:
  ```python
  staging_jwt_secret = (
      self.env.get("JWT_SECRET_STAGING") or 
      self.env.get("JWT_SECRET_KEY") or 
      "7SVLKvh7mJNeF6njiRJMoZpUWLya3NfsvJfRHPc0-cYI7Oh80oXOUHuBNuMjUI4ghNTHFH0H7s9vf3S835ET5A"
  )
  ```
- **Backend Token Validation**: Uses `auth_client.validate_token_jwt()` which delegates to auth service
- **Key Issue**: Test framework creates tokens with fallback secrets, but staging backend may have different JWT_SECRET_STAGING configuration

### **Why #4: Why are there JWT secret mismatches between test creation and validation?**

**Answer**: The staging environment has complex secret resolution paths with different fallback mechanisms between the test framework and the actual auth service, leading to tokens being signed with one secret but validated against another.

**Evidence**:
- **From Previous Analysis** (`reports/staging/FIVE_WHYS_BACKEND_500_ERROR_20250907.md`):
  - AUTH_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_BUG_FIX_REPORT_20250905.md mentioned SERVICE_SECRET entropy validation failures
  - **Hex string validation issues**: "HEX STRINGS ARE VALID SECRETS" - auth validation was overly strict
  - **OAuth redirect mismatches**: Should be warnings in non-prod, not failures
- **Environment Configuration Complexity**:
  - Test framework: `JWT_SECRET_STAGING` → `JWT_SECRET_KEY` → hardcoded fallback
  - Auth service: May have different secret resolution order or missing environment variables
  - **Missing Deployment Validation**: Secrets validation was skipped during deployment

### **Why #5: Why do we have unsafe secret configuration that allows mismatched JWT secrets?**

**Answer**: The system architecture lacks unified secret validation and has multiple fallback mechanisms that can diverge between services, creating a systemic risk where tokens can be created with different secrets than they're validated against.

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
1. **Multiple Secret Resolution Paths**: Test framework and auth service use different fallback hierarchies
2. **Missing Cross-Service Secret Validation**: No verification that all services use the same JWT secret
3. **Deployment Safety Gaps**: From previous analysis - "deployment defaults allow broken configurations" 
4. **Legacy Auth Validation Issues**: Previous fixes show auth validation was "overly strict for hex strings" and "staging environments"

## Timeline of Issues

Based on git logs and previous reports:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Sept 5, 2025 | AUTH_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_BUG_FIX - Fixed overly strict SERVICE_SECRET validation |
| Sept 7, 2025 | Multiple commits: "fix(staging): resolve JWT secret mismatch causing WebSocket 403 errors" |
| Sept 7, 2025 | "fix(tests): resolve WebSocket auth failures in staging - 403 Forbidden errors fixed" |
| Sept 8, 2025 | Current Issue: API endpoints still returning 403 despite WebSocket fixes |

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact
- **Revenue at Risk**: $120K+ MRR blocked by staging validation failures
- **Development Velocity**: E2E test failures preventing staging deployments
- **Customer Confidence**: Staging environment instability affects release confidence

### Technical Impact
- **API Authentication Broken**: Chat endpoints returning 403 consistently
- **Test Infrastructure Failure**: E2E tests cannot validate core functionality
- **Development Process Disruption**: Cannot validate staging before production

## Root Cause Summary

The primary root cause is **inconsistent JWT secret configuration between test framework and staging auth service**, compounded by:

1. **Secret Resolution Divergence**: Different fallback mechanisms in test vs production code
2. **Missing Secret Validation**: No cross-service verification of JWT secret consistency  
3. **Deployment Safety Gaps**: Previous issues show deployment without proper secret validation
4. **Legacy Auth Strictness**: Previous overly strict validation created workarounds that mask real issues

## Proposed SSOT-Compliant Fix Plan

### Immediate Fix (Emergency)

1. **Unified Secret Validation**:
   ```bash
   # Add to deployment validation
   python scripts/validate_jwt_secrets_consistency.py --environment staging
   ```

2. **Test Framework Fix**:
   ```python
   # In test_framework/ssot/e2e_auth_helper.py
   def _create_staging_compatible_jwt(self, email: str) -> str:
       # CRITICAL: Get EXACT same secret as auth service uses
       auth_service_secret = self._get_auth_service_jwt_secret()
       if not auth_service_secret:
           raise Exception("Cannot create staging JWT: Auth service secret not accessible")
   ```

3. **Auth Service Secret Exposure**:
   ```python
   # Add endpoint to auth service for secret validation (admin only)
   @app.get("/admin/jwt-secret-hash")
   async def get_jwt_secret_hash(admin_user: AdminUserDep):
       # Return hash of JWT secret for validation, not actual secret
       return {"secret_hash": hashlib.sha256(jwt_secret.encode()).hexdigest()[:16]}
   ```

### Long-term Prevention Measures

#### 1. Unified Secret Management
```python
# Create shared secret resolution utility
class UnifiedJWTSecretResolver:
    @classmethod
    def get_staging_jwt_secret(cls, service_name: str) -> str:
        # SINGLE resolution path for all services
        secret = (
            get_env().get("JWT_SECRET_STAGING") or
            get_env().get("JWT_SECRET_KEY") or
            cls._get_from_secret_manager("jwt-secret-staging")
        )
        if not secret:
            raise SecretNotFoundError(f"JWT secret not found for {service_name}")
        return secret
```

#### 2. Cross-Service Secret Validation
```python
# Add to deployment validation
def validate_jwt_secrets_consistency():
    test_secret = E2EAuthHelper._get_jwt_secret()
    auth_service_hash = requests.get("/admin/jwt-secret-hash").json()["secret_hash"]
    test_hash = hashlib.sha256(test_secret.encode()).hexdigest()[:16]
    
    if test_hash != auth_service_hash:
        raise DeploymentValidationError("JWT secret mismatch between test framework and auth service")
```

#### 3. Enhanced Monitoring
- **JWT Secret Drift Detection**: Monitor for different JWT secret usage across services
- **Auth Validation Failure Alerting**: Alert on 403 patterns that indicate secret mismatches
- **Deployment Health Checks**: Automated post-deployment auth flow validation

## Verification Steps

1. **Secret Consistency Check**: Verify all services use same JWT secret
2. **Token Creation Test**: Create token with test framework, validate with auth service directly
3. **API Endpoint Test**: Test actual failing endpoints (`/api/chat/stream`, `/api/chat/messages`)
4. **WebSocket Validation**: Ensure WebSocket auth still works after fixes
5. **Full E2E Test Suite**: Run complete staging test suite

## Configuration Drift Prevention

Based on previous analysis patterns:

1. **Mandatory Secret Validation**: Make JWT secret consistency checks mandatory in staging/production deployments
2. **Environment Isolation**: Ensure test secrets don't leak between environments  
3. **Secret Rotation Coordination**: When secrets rotate, update all services atomically
4. **Fallback Elimination**: Remove multiple fallback paths that can diverge

## Lessons Learned

1. **Secret Management Complexity**: Multiple fallback paths create hidden dependencies
2. **Cross-Service Validation**: Token creation and validation must use identical secrets
3. **Test-Production Parity**: Test authentication must exactly match production flows
4. **Error Visibility**: 403 errors can mask JWT signature validation failures
5. **Deployment Validation**: Critical security configurations need mandatory validation

## Next Steps

1. **Execute immediate secret consistency fix** to restore staging functionality
2. **Implement unified secret management** across all services
3. **Add cross-service secret validation** to deployment pipeline  
4. **Create monitoring dashboard** for auth service health and JWT validation rates
5. **Update documentation** to reflect unified secret management requirements

**Priority**: P1 CRITICAL  

## 🎯 CRITICAL FINDING

**The REAL ROOT ROOT ROOT cause**: JWT tokens are being created with different secrets than they're validated against, due to divergent secret resolution paths between the test framework and auth service. This creates a fundamental authentication mismatch where tokens appear valid during creation but fail during validation.

**Immediate Action Required**: Unify JWT secret resolution across all services to use identical secrets for token creation and validation.
