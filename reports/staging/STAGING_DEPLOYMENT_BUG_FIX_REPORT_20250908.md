# Staging Deployment Failure - Bug Fix Report
**Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Issue**: Cloud Run container failed to start after WebSocket 1011 fix deployment
**Business Impact**: $120K+ MRR at risk - staging environment down after fix attempt

## Problem Statement

After successfully implementing the WebSocket 1011 JSON serialization fix and committing the changes, the deployment to GCP staging failed with:

```
ERROR: Revision 'netra-backend-staging-00170-55z' is not ready and cannot serve traffic. 
The user-provided container failed to start and listen on the port defined provided by the PORT=8000 
environment variable within the allocated timeout.
```

## Five Whys Analysis

### Why #1: Why did the container fail to start?
**Answer**: The container failed to listen on PORT=8000 within the allocated timeout

### Why #2: Why couldn't the container listen on port 8000?
**Investigation needed**: Check GCP logs for startup errors, dependency issues, or configuration problems

### Why #3: Why did this failure occur after our WebSocket fix?
**Hypothesis**: The WebSocket fix might have introduced a startup dependency or configuration issue

### Why #4: Why wasn't this caught in local testing?
**Analysis**: Local testing focused on the WebSocket serialization fix functionality, not container startup

### Why #5: Why does staging have different startup behavior?
**Root Cause Investigation Needed**: Environment-specific configuration, dependencies, or resource constraints

## Current Status

- ✅ **WebSocket Fix**: Successfully implemented and tested locally
- ✅ **Local Tests**: All 15 WebSocket serialization tests passing
- ✅ **Git Commit**: Fix committed to repository 
- ❌ **Staging Deployment**: Container startup failure
- ❌ **Business Impact**: Staging environment unusable

## Investigation Required

### Immediate Actions
1. **GCP Logs Review**: Examine container startup logs for specific error
2. **Startup Dependency Check**: Verify all required environment variables and dependencies
3. **Resource Analysis**: Check if container has sufficient resources for startup
4. **Configuration Review**: Compare staging config vs. working configuration

### GCP Logs URL

```

## Deployment Details

- **Revision**: netra-backend-staging-00170-55z
- **Project**: netra-staging  
- **Region**: us-central1
- **Image**: gcr.io/netra-staging/netra-backend-staging:latest
- **Expected Port**: 8000
- **Build**: Local Alpine image successfully created and pushed

## Next Steps

1. **Review GCP startup logs** to identify specific failure cause
2. **Test container locally** to reproduce startup issue
3. **Validate staging environment variables** and configuration
4. **Implement fix** for identified startup issue
5. **Re-deploy** with corrected configuration
6. **Verify WebSocket fix** works in deployed environment

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk**: Staging environment completely down
- No ability to test WebSocket fix effectiveness
- Cannot validate business-critical chat functionality
- Blocks further development and testing cycles

**Timeline Critical**: Must resolve before end of day to maintain development velocity
