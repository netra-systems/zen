## Analysis
The single failure is in WebSocket authentication, specifically when attempting to connect with JWT authentication. The server is returning HTTP 403 Forbidden, indicating an authentication/authorization issue.

## Next Steps
1. Investigate WebSocket JWT authentication on staging
2. Check GCP logs for authentication errors
3. Verify JWT secret configuration in staging environment
4. Fix the authentication issue
5. Re-run tests to verify fix
