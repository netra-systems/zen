# Docker Memory Configuration Analysis

## System Memory Overview

### Physical System Memory
- **Total System RAM**: 64 GB (68,388,851,712 bytes)
- **WSL2 Allocated Memory**: 32 GB (32,705,684 KB)
- **WSL2 Available Memory**: ~31 GB (31,358,108 KB)

## Key Finding: Memory is NOT the Bottleneck

Your system has **64 GB of RAM** with **32 GB allocated to WSL2**, which is more than sufficient for Docker operations. The Docker services only request ~3.2 GB total, which is well within limits.

## WSL2 Default Configuration

Without a `.wslconfig` file, WSL2 uses default settings:
- **Memory**: 50% of total RAM or 8GB, whichever is less
- **On your system**: Should be getting ~32 GB (which matches what we see)

## Docker Service Memory Requirements

From `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
Dev Environment Total:
- PostgreSQL:    256 MB
- Redis:         128 MB  
- ClickHouse:    512 MB
- Auth Service:  256 MB
- Backend:      2048 MB
- Frontend:      512 MB
Total:          ~3.2 GB
```

## Real Issue: Not Memory, but Docker Operations

With 32 GB available to WSL2 and only 3.2 GB needed, **memory is NOT causing the crashes**.

The real issues are:
1. **Rapid Docker state changes** (restart storms)
2. **Docker Desktop daemon instability** from excessive API calls
3. **Windows-specific Docker Desktop limitations** with handling rapid container lifecycle changes

## Recommended `.wslconfig` Settings

Even though memory isn't the issue, you could create `C:\Users\antho\.wslconfig` to optimize WSL2:

```ini
[wsl2]
memory=16GB          # Reduce from 32GB - still plenty for Docker
processors=8         # Limit CPU cores for WSL2
swap=8GB            # Add swap space
localhostForwarding=true
guiApplications=false  # Disable GUI support to save resources

# Helps with Docker stability
kernelCommandLine = cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1
```

## Why Docker Desktop Still Crashes

Despite having plenty of memory, Docker Desktop crashes because:

1. **Docker Daemon Overload**: The Windows Docker daemon can't handle rapid-fire restart commands
2. **WSL2 Bridge Issues**: The bridge between Windows and WSL2 gets overwhelmed
3. **File System Operations**: Bind mounts and volume operations through WSL2 are expensive
4. **Network Namespace Churn**: Rapid container creation/destruction causes network subsystem stress

## Verification Commands

Check current Docker Desktop settings:
```powershell
# In PowerShell (as admin)
wsl --shutdown
wsl --status

# Check Docker Desktop settings file
type "%APPDATA%\Docker\settings.json"
```

## Conclusion

Your system has **plenty of memory** (64 GB total, 32 GB for WSL2). The crashes are caused by:
- Docker operation patterns (restart storms)
- Docker Desktop's inability to handle rapid state changes
- NOT memory constraints

The solution remains:
1. Reduce Docker restart frequency
2. Add cooldown periods between operations
3. Limit concurrent Docker API calls
4. Use health checks instead of restarts
