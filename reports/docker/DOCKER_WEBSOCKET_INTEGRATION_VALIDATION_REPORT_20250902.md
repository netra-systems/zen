- Agent executes successfully with meaningful results
- Response time < 10 seconds for simple tasks

#### 2. Multi-User Concurrent Execution  
**Business Value:** Validates system can handle multiple users simultaneously  
**Simulation:** 5 concurrent users running different agents  
**Validation Points:**
- All users can execute agents simultaneously
- Thread isolation maintained (no data leakage between users)
- WebSocket event routing works correctly per user
- 95%+ success rate for concurrent executions

#### 3. Failure Recovery Scenarios
**Business Value:** Validates system resilience and recovery capabilities  
**Test Cases:**
- Docker service restart during execution
- WebSocket disconnection/reconnection
- Orchestrator unavailability scenarios
- Recovery time < 30 seconds for most scenarios

#### 4. Performance Under Load
**Business Value:** Validates system can handle production-level concurrent load  
**Load Profile:** 10 agents running simultaneously, 100+ WebSocket events/sec  
**Success Criteria:**
- 95%+ WebSocket event delivery rate under load
- Memory usage remains stable (no significant leaks)
- Average response time < 5 seconds per agent
- Thread registry handles load without corruption

✅ **Event Delivery Reliability** - Retry mechanisms for WebSocket events  

**Integration States Validated:**
- UNINITIALIZED → INITIALIZING → ACTIVE state transitions
- Recovery mechanisms functional
- Health monitoring operational

### Agent Service Integration
✅ **Business Logic Separation** - Clean separation of concerns maintained  
✅ **Thread Safety** - Multi-user execution isolation validated

```python
@dataclass 
class PerformanceMetrics:
    # Docker metrics
    docker_startup_time_ms: float
    docker_health_check_time_ms: float
    container_memory_usage_mb: float
    container_cpu_usage_percent: float
    
    # WebSocket metrics
    websocket_connection_time_ms: float
    websocket_events_sent: int
    websocket_events_received: int
    websocket_event_delivery_rate: float
    
    # Agent metrics
    agent_execution_time_ms: float
    agent_response_time_ms: float
    tools_executed: int
    
    # System metrics
    thread_isolation_violations: int
