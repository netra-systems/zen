# Docker Package Stability Note

## Current Configuration Status
- **Date:** 2025-08-31
- **Branch:** critical-remediation-20250823
- **Decision:** Keep Docker packages as-is for now

## Stability Considerations
The Docker configurations currently default to main packages. While there may be stability concerns with certain package versions or configurations, the current approach prioritizes:

1. **Consistency** - Using main packages ensures all environments work with the same dependencies
2. **Simplicity** - Avoiding version pinning complexity during active stabilization
3. **Flexibility** - Easier to update and test new package versions

## Future Considerations
Once the core system stabilizes (per Mission 0 in CLAUDE.md), consider:
- Pinning critical package versions for production stability
- Creating separate development vs production Docker configurations
- Implementing dependency version management strategy

## Files Affected
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `docker/backend.development.Dockerfile`
- Other Docker configuration files in the repository

*Note: This is a temporary decision focused on maintaining development velocity while the system is being stabilized.*
