# GCP Staging Environment Error Audit Report
**Date:** January 7, 2025  
**Environment:** netra-staging  
**Services Audited:** netra-backend-staging, netra-auth-service

## Executive Summary

Critical authentication failures are occurring in the staging environment, causing cascading failures across the system. The backend service is unable to validate tokens through the auth service, resulting in complete authentication breakdown.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Authentication Service Communication Failure (CRITICAL)
**Pattern:** Continuous auth validation failures  
**Frequency:** Every request requiring authentication  
**Error Messages:**
- `Auth service is required for token validation - no fallback available`
- `Token validation returned None - auth service likely down or unreachable`
- `Invalid or expired token`

**Impact:** Complete authentication failure preventing all authenticated operations

### 2. WebSocket Authentication Failures
**Pattern:** WebSocket connections being rejected  
**Error Messages:**
- `WebSocket authentication failed: Invalid or expired authentication token`
- `Failed to extract user context from WebSocket: 401: Authentication failed`

**Impact:** Real-time features and chat functionality completely broken

### 3. Database Session Creation Failures
**Pattern:** Request-scoped database sessions failing due to auth issues  
**Error Messages:**
- `Failed to create request-scoped database session: 401: Invalid or expired token`
- `Database session error: 401: Invalid or expired token`

**Impact:** Database operations failing, preventing data access

## Service Health Status

### Backend Service (netra-backend-staging)
- **Cloud Run Status:** Ready (as of 2025-09-06T23:55:42Z)
- **Operational Status:** Degraded - Authentication failures on all protected endpoints
- **Last Deployment:** 2025-09-06T23:55:42Z

### Auth Service (netra-auth-service)
- **Cloud Run Status:** Ready (as of 2025-09-07T00:15:43Z)
- **Operational Status:** Partially functional - Token validation endpoint failing
- **Last Deployment:** 2025-09-07T00:15:43Z
- **Additional Issues:** Token blacklist errors observed

## Error Timeline

1. **23:41 UTC (Sept 6):** Auth service deployment issues - ImportError for SecretLoader
2. **23:49 UTC:** Token blacklist errors begin appearing
3. **00:15 UTC (Sept 7):** Auth service redeployed
4. **02:09-02:13 UTC:** Continuous authentication failures across all services

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue appears to be a broken authentication flow between the backend and auth services:

1. **Backend â†’ Auth Service Communication:** The backend service cannot successfully validate tokens with the auth service
2. **Token Validation Endpoint:** Returns None or invalid responses consistently
3. **No Fallback Mechanism:** System has no fallback when auth service is unreachable
4. **Cascading Failures:** Auth failures propagate to WebSocket connections and database sessions

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Verify Auth Service Endpoints:**
   - Check if auth service is actually responding at https://auth.staging.netrasystems.ai
   - Verify token validation endpoint is functional

2. **Check Service Configuration:**
   - Verify AUTH_SERVICE_URL environment variable in backend
   - Check JWT secret key configuration in both services
   - Ensure service-to-service authentication is properly configured

3. **Review Recent Changes:**
   - Check what changed between 23:55 (backend deploy) and 00:15 (auth deploy)
   - Review any configuration changes that might affect authentication

4. **Implement Monitoring:**
   - Add health checks for auth service connectivity
   - Implement circuit breakers for auth service calls
   - Add detailed logging for auth failures

## Recommendations

1. **Short-term (Immediate):**
   - Rollback to last known working configuration
   - Verify all environment variables are correctly set
   - Test auth service endpoints directly

2. **Medium-term (This Week):**
   - Implement proper health checks between services
   - Add fallback mechanisms for auth service unavailability
   - Improve error messages to include more diagnostic information

3. **Long-term (This Month):**
   - Implement proper service mesh for inter-service communication
   - Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
   - Create runbooks for common failure scenarios

## Metrics Summary

- **Error Rate:** 100% for authenticated endpoints
- **Services Affected:** 2 (backend, auth)
- **Time Since Last Successful Auth:** Unknown (no successful auth in recent logs)
- **Customer Impact:** Total - No users can authenticate or use the platform

## Next Steps

1. Immediate investigation of auth service token validation endpoint
2. Verify all secrets and environment variables are correctly configured
3. Test service-to-service communication paths
4. Consider emergency rollback if issues persist
