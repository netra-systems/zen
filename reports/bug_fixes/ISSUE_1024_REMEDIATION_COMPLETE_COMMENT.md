Success Rate: 100%
```

### Tools Created
1. **Detection Tools:**
   - `detect_unauthorized_test_runners.py` - AST-based pattern detection
   - `detect_pytest_main_violations.py` - Comprehensive violation scanning
   - `check_ssot_import_compliance.py` - SSOT import enforcement

2. **Migration Tools:**
   - `migrate_pytest_main_violations.py` - Automated systematic migration

  files: '\.py$'
  stages: [commit]
```

### Continuous Monitoring
- **Zero tolerance** for new pytest.main() violations
- **Automated alerts** for SSOT regression attempts
- **Historical tracking** prevents compliance degradation
- **Business impact metrics** ensure revenue protection

## üéØ Business Value Delivered

### Revenue Protection
- **$500K+ ARR secured** from test infrastructure chaos

## üìã Usage Instructions

### For New Development
```bash
# All test execution through SSOT unified runner
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category unit
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category integration
```

### For Migration of Remaining Files
```bash
# Dry run validation
python scripts/migrate_pytest_main_violations.py <target> --dry-run

# Live migration with backup
python scripts/migrate_pytest_main_violations.py <target> --live
```

### For Continuous Monitoring
```bash
# Single compliance scan
python scripts/monitor_ssot_compliance.py --monitor-websocket
