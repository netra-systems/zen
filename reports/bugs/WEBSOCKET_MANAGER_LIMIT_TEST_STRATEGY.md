# WebSocket Manager Limit Fix - Test Strategy & Regression Prevention

**Date:** 2025-01-28  
**Fix Version:** Five Whys Root Cause Resolution  
**Related:** WEBSOCKET_MANAGER_LIMIT_FIVE_WHYS_ANALYSIS.md  

## Test Strategy Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive test strategy to validate the Five Whys fixes and prevent regression of the WebSocket manager limit issue.

### Key Fixes Being Tested:
1. ‚úÖ **Silent failure elimination** - Background task creation failures are now explicit
2. ‚úÖ **Emergency cleanup mechanism** - Immediate cleanup when limits are approached  
3. ‚úÖ **Environment-aware intervals** - Different cleanup timing for test/dev/prod
4. ‚úÖ **Manual cleanup APIs** - Public methods for test environment cleanup

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests - WebSocket Factory Core Logic

**Test File:** `netra_backend/tests/unit/test_websocket_manager_factory_five_whys_fix.py`

#### Test Cases:

```python
class TestWebSocketManagerFactoryFiveWhysFix:
    """Validate Five Whys fixes for WebSocket manager limit issue."""
    
    async def test_emergency_cleanup_triggers_before_limit_reached(self):
        """Test that emergency cleanup is attempted before throwing limit error."""
        # Create managers near limit, verify emergency cleanup triggers
        
    async def test_background_task_failure_is_explicit_not_silent(self):
        """Test that background task creation failures are logged explicitly."""
        # Mock event loop failure, verify warning messages logged
        
    async def test_environment_aware_cleanup_intervals(self):
        """Test that cleanup intervals adjust based on environment."""
        # Test different ENV values produce different intervals
        
    async def test_manual_cleanup_apis_work_when_background_fails(self):
        """Test public cleanup APIs as fallback when background tasks fail."""
        # Test force_cleanup_user_managers and force_cleanup_all_expired
        
    async def test_manager_count_tracking_accuracy(self):
        """Test that user manager counts are accurately maintained during cleanup."""
        # Create/cleanup managers, verify counts are consistent
```

### 2. Integration Tests - Multi-User Scenarios  

**Test File:** `netra_backend/tests/integration/test_websocket_manager_limit_multiuser.py`

#### Test Cases:

```python
class TestWebSocketManagerLimitMultiUser:
    """Integration tests for manager limits across multiple users."""
    
    async def test_multiple_users_can_reach_individual_limits_safely(self):
        """Test that multiple users can each use their full allocation."""
        # Create 5 managers each for 10 different users
        
    async def test_rapid_connection_creation_triggers_emergency_cleanup(self):
        """Test rapid connection creation patterns that previously failed."""
        # Simulate rapid test execution patterns
        
    async def test_staging_environment_parity_with_local(self):
        """Test that staging and local environments behave similarly."""
        # Test same patterns in different environment configurations
```

### 3. Load Tests - Stress Testing Manager Limits

**Test File:** `tests/integration/websocket/test_websocket_manager_load_testing.py`

#### Test Cases:

```python
class TestWebSocketManagerLoadTesting:
    """Load testing for manager creation and cleanup patterns."""
    
    async def test_create_managers_faster_than_cleanup_interval(self):
        """Test creating managers faster than background cleanup runs."""
        # Stress test the emergency cleanup mechanism
        
    async def test_concurrent_manager_creation_and_cleanup(self):
        """Test race conditions between creation and cleanup."""
        # Validate thread safety of factory operations
        
    async def test_memory_leak_prevention_under_load(self):
        """Test that manager cleanup prevents memory accumulation."""
        # Monitor memory usage during stress testing
```

### 4. Environment-Specific Tests

**Test File:** `tests/e2e/test_websocket_manager_environment_specific.py`

#### Test Cases:

```python
class TestWebSocketManagerEnvironmentSpecific:
    """Test environment-specific behaviors and configurations."""
    
    async def test_test_environment_30_second_cleanup_interval(self):
        """Validate test environments use 30-second cleanup."""
        
    async def test_production_environment_5_minute_cleanup_interval(self):
        """Validate production environments use 5-minute cleanup."""
        
    async def test_container_event_loop_compatibility(self):
        """Test background task creation in containerized environments."""
```

## Staging Test Requirements

### Staging Pipeline Validation

The following tests must pass in the staging environment to validate the fix:

1. **Resource Limit Test:** Create 6 managers for single user, verify emergency cleanup works
2. **Background Task Test:** Verify background cleanup task starts successfully in containers
3. **Multi-User Load Test:** 10 concurrent users with 5 managers each
4. **Environment Detection Test:** Verify staging environment uses appropriate cleanup intervals

### Staging Test Command:

```bash
# Run comprehensive staging tests for WebSocket manager limits
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category integration --real-services --env staging \
  --test-pattern "*websocket*manager*limit*" --verbose --fail-fast

# Specific test for the original failing scenario
python -m pytest tests/integration/websocket/test_websocket_manager_limit_multiuser.py::test_rapid_connection_creation_triggers_emergency_cleanup -v --tb=short
```

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Monitor:

1. **Background Task Health:**
   - `background_cleanup_task_started: true/false`
   - `background_cleanup_failures: count`
   - `emergency_cleanup_triggers: count`

2. **Manager Lifecycle:**
   - `managers_created_per_minute: count`
   - `managers_cleaned_up_per_minute: count` 
   - `resource_limit_hits: count`
   - `successful_emergency_cleanups: count`

3. **User Distribution:**
   - `users_at_manager_limit: count`
   - `average_managers_per_user: float`
   - `max_concurrent_managers: count`

### Log Patterns to Monitor:

```
# Success patterns to look for:
‚úÖ Background cleanup task started successfully
‚úÖ Emergency cleanup successful - proceeding with manager creation
üî• EMERGENCY CLEANUP COMPLETE: Cleaned N managers

# Failure patterns that should NOT appear:
‚ùå Silent RuntimeError in background task creation (should be explicit warnings)
‚ùå Hard limit reached without emergency cleanup attempt
‚ùå Manager count tracking inconsistencies
```

## Regression Prevention

### Automated Checks:

1. **Daily Pipeline Check:**
   - Run WebSocket manager load test daily in staging
   - Alert if background cleanup task fails to start
   - Alert if emergency cleanup success rate < 95%

2. **Code Review Checklist:**
   - [ ] Any changes to WebSocketManagerFactory must include cleanup tests
   - [ ] Background task modifications must be tested in containerized environments  
   - [ ] Resource limit changes must update emergency cleanup thresholds

3. **Deployment Gates:**
   - Staging deployment must pass WebSocket manager limit stress test
   - Production deployment requires successful 24-hour staging stability test

### Known Anti-Patterns to Avoid:

1. **Silent Failures:** Never catch exceptions without explicit logging
2. **Async/Sync Mismatch:** Don't enforce synchronous limits with only async cleanup
3. **Environment Ignorance:** Don't use same configuration for all environments
4. **Resource Leak Tolerance:** Don't assume background cleanup will always work

---

## Success Criteria

The fix is considered successful when:

### Primary Success Metrics:
- ‚úÖ **Zero staging test failures** due to "maximum number of WebSocket managers" error
- ‚úÖ **100% background task startup success** in containerized environments
- ‚úÖ **Emergency cleanup success rate > 95%** when limits are approached
- ‚úÖ **Staging/local test parity** - same behavior across environments

### Performance Success Metrics:
- ‚úÖ **Manager creation latency < 100ms** even when emergency cleanup triggers
- ‚úÖ **Memory stability** - no manager accumulation over 24-hour test runs  
- ‚úÖ **Concurrent user support** - 50+ users with 5 managers each simultaneously

### Operational Success Metrics:
- ‚úÖ **Clear error messages** - no more silent failures in logs
- ‚úÖ **Environment awareness** - appropriate cleanup intervals per environment
- ‚úÖ **Manual recovery capability** - tests can force cleanup when needed

## Rollback Plan

If the fix introduces new issues:

1. **Immediate Rollback Triggers:**
   - Manager creation latency > 500ms
   - Background cleanup completely failing
   - Memory leak detection in staging

2. **Rollback Process:**
   - Revert to previous WebSocketManagerFactory implementation
   - Temporarily increase manager limits as interim solution
   - Re-analyze with additional Five Whys if needed

3. **Post-Rollback Actions:**
   - Root cause analysis of fix failure
   - Enhanced test coverage for missed scenarios  
   - Improved staging environment simulation
