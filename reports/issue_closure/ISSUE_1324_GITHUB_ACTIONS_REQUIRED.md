## Duplicate Issue - Resolved via Issue #1308

This issue has been determined to be a duplicate of Issue #1308, which was successfully resolved on September 17, 2025.

**Resolution Summary:**
- Root cause: Cross-service SessionManager import violations
- Solution: SSOT auth integration pattern implementation
- Status: 7 files updated, 0 remaining violations
- Verification: Container startup and agent initialization successful

**Technical Details:**
All auth_service import failures have been resolved through proper SSOT compliance implementation. Production code now uses the auth integration layer at `/netra_backend/app/auth_integration/auth.py` instead of direct cross-service imports.

**System Health:** ✅ VERIFIED - No remaining import conflicts, full functionality restored.

**Evidence:**
- GoalsTriageSubAgent imports and instantiates successfully
- 0 remaining problematic cross-service imports (verified)
- Container startup tests pass without import errors
- Full documentation at `/reports/issue_closure/ISSUE_1324_CLOSURE_REPORT.md`

Closing as duplicate of Issue #1308.
