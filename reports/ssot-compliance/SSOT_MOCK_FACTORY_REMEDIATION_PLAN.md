**Objective:** Remediate business-critical mock violations affecting Golden Path

**Target Violations:**
- **WebSocket Mocks:** 1,082 violations (Golden Path critical)
- **Agent Mocks:** 286 violations (AI pipeline critical)  
- **Database Mocks:** 584 violations (persistence critical)

**High-Priority Files (32+ violations each):**
1. `/tests/integration/test_agent_message_error_recovery.py` (32 violations)
2. `/tests/integration/test_websocket_agent_message_flow.py` (32 violations)
3. `/tests/integration/test_multi_user_message_isolation.py` (31 violations)
4. `/tests/integration/test_agent_golden_path_messages.py` (38 violations)
5. `/tests/integration/test_agent_execution_context_preservation.py` (33 violations)

**Migration Pattern:**
```python
# FROM (violation pattern):
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, MagicMock, patch
mock_websocket = MagicMock()
mock_agent = AsyncMock()
mock_session = AsyncMock()

# TO (SSOT pattern):
from test_framework.ssot.mock_factory import SSotMockFactory
mock_websocket = SSotMockFactory.create_websocket_mock()
mock_agent = SSotMockFactory.create_agent_mock(agent_type='supervisor')
mock_session = SSotMockFactory.create_database_session_mock()
```

**Atomic Migration Steps:**
1. **File-by-File Migration**
   - One file per commit to maintain atomicity
   - Run full test suite after each file modification
   - Validate Golden Path functionality after each change
   - Immediate rollback if any test failures

2. **Import Standardization**

   ```bash
   python -m py_compile modified_file.py
   ```

2. **Import Validation**
   ```bash
   python -c "import modified_module; print('Imports successful')"
   ```

3. **File-Specific Tests**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest modified_file.py -v
   ```

### Level 2: Component-Level Validation (After component completion)
**Objective:** Ensure component integration remains functional

**Golden Path Components:**
1. **WebSocket Event System**
   ```bash
   python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py
   ```

2. **Agent Execution Pipeline**  
   ```bash
   python tests/mission_critical/test_agent_execution_pipeline.py
   ```

3. **Database Integration**
   ```bash
   python tests/mission_critical/test_database_integration.py
   ```

### Level 3: System-Level Validation (After phase completion)

**Validation Command:**
```bash
# Full Golden Path validation
python tests/mission_critical/test_golden_path_complete.py

# Critical system functionality
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --categories mission_critical integration --real-services
```

### Level 4: Business Value Validation (After critical phases)
**Objective:** Ensure $500K+ ARR chat functionality remains operational

**Business Validation Steps:**
1. **End-to-End Chat Flow**
   - User login → agent response pipeline
   - Real-time WebSocket event delivery
   - Substantive AI response quality

2. **Multi-User Isolation**
   - Concurrent user execution
   - Context isolation validation
   - No cross-user data leakage

3. **Performance Requirements**
   - Test execution time <10% degradation
