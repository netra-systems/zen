## DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION RESULTS

### 1. Git Merge Conflict Resolution ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Challenge**: Complex merge conflict between Issue #374 (database exception handling) and Issue #414 (user isolation)

**Resolution Approach**:
- **Method Signature**: Combined both approaches - maintained `user_context` parameter from #414 with backward compatibility
- **Exception Handling**: Preserved enhanced exception handling from #374 with specific `DeadlockError`/`ConnectionError` blocks
- **Session Management**: Maintained Issue #414 session tracking and pool management features
- **Import Integration**: Added transaction_errors imports for Issue #374 functionality

**Technical Changes**:
```python
# Combined method signature
async def get_session(self, engine_name: str = 'primary', 
                      user_context: Optional[Any] = None, 
                      operation_type: str = "unknown"):

# Enhanced exception handling from Issue #374
except (DeadlockError, ConnectionError) as e:
    original_exception = classify_error(e)
    # Enhanced error context and logging
    
except Exception as e:
    original_exception = classify_error(e)  # Issue #374 enhancement
    # Continue with Issue #414 session cleanup
```
