## Timeout Hierarchy Validation

### ✅ All Customer Tiers Validated
```
✓ FREE tier: WebSocket (10s) > Agent (8s) = VALID
✓ EARLY tier: WebSocket (10s) > Agent (8s) = VALID  
✓ MID tier: WebSocket (90s) > Agent (60s) = VALID
✓ PLATFORM tier: WebSocket (150s) > Agent (120s) = VALID
✓ ENTERPRISE tier: WebSocket (360s) > Agent (300s) = VALID
```

### ✅ Environment-Specific Validation
```
✓ Local Development: 10s > 8s (gap: 2s) = VALID
✓ Testing: 15s > 10s (gap: 5s) = VALID
✓ Staging: 35s > 30s (gap: 5s) = VALID  
✓ Production: 45s > 40s (gap: 5s) = VALID
```
