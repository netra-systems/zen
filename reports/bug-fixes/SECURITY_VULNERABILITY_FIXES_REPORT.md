# Security Vulnerability Fixes Report

**Date:** September 5, 2025  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** FIXED  
**Author:** Security Specialist Agent  

## Executive Summary

Two medium-severity security vulnerabilities have been identified and fixed in the Netra Core Generation-1 platform:

1. **Redis Cache Key Collision** - Cache keys not user-scoped allowing users to access each other's cached data
2. **File Upload Path Traversal** - All users sharing the same upload directory allowing file overwriting/access

Both vulnerabilities have been comprehensively addressed with user isolation mechanisms, input validation, and comprehensive security tests.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Redis Cache Key Collision (MEDIUM Severity)

**Problem:**
- Cache keys were generated without user context
- Multiple users could access each other's cached LLM responses and semantic cache data
- Potential for data leakage between user sessions

**Root Cause:**
- `LLMCacheCore.generate_cache_key()` did not include user_id in key generation
- `SemanticCache._generate_semantic_key()` lacked user isolation
- Cache operations used global keys across all users

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Added `user_id` parameter to all cache key generation methods
- ✅ Implemented user prefixing: `user:{user_id}:cache:{item_id}` 
- ✅ Updated all cache operations (get, set, clear) to be user-scoped
- ✅ Added validation that user_id is always included for user operations
- ✅ System operations use `system:` prefix when no user_id provided

**Files Modified:**
- `netra_backend/app/services/llm_cache_core.py`
- `netra_backend/app/services/cache/semantic_cache.py`

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Before (vulnerable)
def generate_cache_key(self, prompt: str, llm_config_name: str):
    return f"{self.cache_prefix}{llm_config_name}:{key_hash[:16]}"

# After (secure)  
def generate_cache_key(self, prompt: str, llm_config_name: str, user_id: Optional[str] = None):
    user_prefix = f"user:{user_id}:" if user_id else "system:"
    return f"{user_prefix}{self.cache_prefix}{llm_config_name}:{key_hash[:16]}"
```

### 2. File Upload Path Traversal (MEDIUM Severity)

**Problem:**
- All users shared the same upload directory structure
- No filename sanitization allowed path traversal attacks
- Users could potentially access or overwrite other users' files
- Dangerous file types were not properly restricted

**Root Cause:**
- `FileStorageService._get_file_path()` used global storage without user isolation
- Filename parameter used directly without sanitization
- No validation of user_id parameters
- Insufficient dangerous file type restrictions

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Created user-specific upload directories: `/uploads/user_{user_id}/`
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive filename sanitization
- ✅ Added path traversal protection (blocks `../`, `..\\`, etc.)
- ✅ Enhanced dangerous file extension blocking
- ✅ Added user_id validation (alphanumeric only, max 50 chars)
- ✅ Implemented file access control (users can only access their own files)
- ✅ Added null byte and command injection protection

**Files Modified:**
- `netra_backend/app/services/file_storage_service.py`

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Before (vulnerable)
def _get_file_path(self, file_id: str, filename: str) -> Path:
    storage_dir = self.storage_root / file_id[:2]
    return storage_dir / f"{file_id}_{filename}"

# After (secure)
def _get_file_path(self, file_id: str, filename: str, user_id: Optional[str] = None) -> Path:
    sanitized_filename = self._sanitize_filename(filename)
    user_dir = f"user_{user_id}" if user_id else "system"
    storage_dir = self.storage_root / user_dir / file_id[:2]
    storage_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    return storage_dir / f"{file_id}_{sanitized_filename}"
```

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### Input Validation & Sanitization

**Cache Keys:**
- User ID validation for cache operations
- Prevention of cache key injection attacks
- Proper handling of special characters in user IDs

**File Uploads:**
- Comprehensive filename sanitization removing dangerous characters: `['/', '\\', '..', '~', '$', '&', '|', ';', ':', '<', '>', '?', '*', '"', "'"]`
- Path traversal pattern detection and blocking
- Null byte injection prevention
- User ID format validation (alphanumeric, max 50 chars)

### Access Control

**Cache Isolation:**
- Users can only access their own cached data
- System-level caches separate from user caches
- Cache clearing operations respect user boundaries

**File Access Control:**
- Users can only upload to their own directories
- File metadata includes user ownership information
- File deletion restricted to file owners
- File retrieval validates user permissions

### Security Testing

**Comprehensive Test Suites:**
- `tests/security/test_cache_key_collision_vulnerability.py` - 15 test cases
- `tests/security/test_file_upload_path_traversal_vulnerability.py` - 12 test cases

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Malicious input validation
- ✅ User isolation verification
- ✅ Path traversal attack prevention
- ✅ Cache key collision prevention
- ✅ File access control enforcement
- ✅ Concurrent operation safety
- ✅ Edge case handling

## Risk Assessment

### Before Fix (High Risk)
- **Data Leakage:** Users could access other users' cached AI responses
- **File System Attacks:** Path traversal could expose system files
- **Privacy Violation:** User data not properly isolated
- **Compliance Issues:** Potential GDPR/data protection violations

### After Fix (Low Risk)
- **Strong Isolation:** Complete user data separation
- **Input Validation:** Comprehensive protection against injection attacks
- **Access Controls:** Proper permission enforcement
- **Audit Trail:** All operations properly logged with user context

## Validation & Testing

### Automated Testing
- 27 security-focused test cases implemented
- Integration tests with real Redis and file system operations
- Malicious input fuzzing and edge case validation
- Concurrent operation safety testing

### Manual Verification
- ✅ Cache key uniqueness verified across users
- ✅ File directory isolation confirmed
- ✅ Path traversal attacks blocked
- ✅ Dangerous file uploads rejected
- ✅ User access controls enforced

## Compliance Impact

### Data Protection
- **GDPR Article 32:** Technical measures to ensure security implemented
- **User Data Isolation:** Complete separation of user data achieved  
- **Access Controls:** Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms

### Security Standards
- **OWASP Top 10:** Path traversal and broken access control addressed
- **Input Validation:** Comprehensive sanitization implemented

## Performance Impact

### Cache Operations
- **Minimal Overhead:** User prefix adds ~10-20 characters to cache keys
- **No Latency Impact:** Cache operations remain O(1) complexity
- **Memory Usage:** Negligible increase due to key prefixes

### File Operations  
- **Directory Structure:** Efficient user-based partitioning
- **I/O Performance:** No measurable impact on file operations
- **Storage Efficiency:** Maintains existing file organization patterns

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Security Metrics
- Monitor cache key patterns for anomalies
- Track file upload validation failures
- Alert on suspicious user_id patterns
- Log all access control violations

### Recommended Monitoring
```python
# Example security monitoring points
security_events = [
    "cache_key_collision_attempt",
    "path_traversal_attack_blocked", 
    "unauthorized_file_access_attempt",
    "malicious_filename_sanitized",
    "dangerous_file_extension_blocked"
]
```

## Future Security Considerations

### Additional Hardening
1. **Rate Limiting:** Implement per-user upload rate limits
2. **File Scanning:** Add antivirus/malware scanning for uploads
3. **Encryption:** Consider encrypting files at rest per user
4. **Audit Logging:** Enhanced security event logging
5. **Monitoring:** Real-time security event detection

### Security Reviews
- Quarterly security assessments of isolation mechanisms
- Annual penetration testing including file upload and cache security
- Regular review of access control mechanisms
