# Staging Configuration Validation Fix Summary

## Problem
Configuration validation was reporting false positive errors about missing critical configs in staging, even though the configs were actually loaded and working.

## Root Cause
The `ConfigDependencyMap.check_config_consistency()` method was checking for environment variable names (UPPERCASE like `DATABASE_URL`, `POSTGRES_HOST`) but the config object uses Python attribute names (lowercase like `database_url`). Additionally, some expected configs like individual Postgres components aren't stored in the config object - they're combined into `database_url`.

## Fix Implemented
1. Added `ENV_TO_CONFIG_MAPPING` dictionary in `ConfigDependencyMap` to map environment variable names to config object attribute paths
2. Updated `check_config_consistency()` to:
   - Detect whether it's checking raw environment variables (uppercase keys) or a config object
   - Use the mapping to check the correct attributes in the config object
   - Handle auto-constructable configs like DATABASE_URL that can be built from components

## Current Status
- ✅ Fixed the key naming mismatch issue
- ✅ Config object validation now uses proper attribute paths
- ✅ Environment variable validation works correctly
- ⚠️ Some false positives remain for configs that are:
  - Combined into other values (POSTGRES_* → database_url)
  - Optional in certain environments
  - Loaded through different mechanisms

## Remaining Issues
The validation still shows some false positives because:
1. **POSTGRES_* components**: These are used to construct `database_url` but aren't stored individually
2. **OAuth configs**: May have different names/paths in staging vs the dependency map expectations
3. **Localhost warnings**: Frontend/backend URLs default to localhost in development but validation warns about this

## Recommendation
The fix addresses the core issue of key mapping. The remaining warnings are mostly informational and don't affect functionality. Consider:
1. Adjusting validation severity levels for different environments
2. Updating ConfigDependencyMap to understand constructed values like DATABASE_URL
3. Making validation environment-aware for URLs (localhost OK in dev, not in staging/prod)
