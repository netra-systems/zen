# WebSocket Connection Stability Fix Report

**Mission Critical Bug Fix - WebSocket Infrastructure**

---

## Executive Summary

**Bug**: WebSocket connection stability test failing due to mockWs being null when expected to be truthy
**Impact**: Critical WebSocket infrastructure not properly tested, potentially affecting 90% of platform revenue through chat experience
**Status**: ACTIVE INVESTIGATION
**Priority**: P0 - Mission Critical (WebSocket events enable substantive chat interactions)

---

## Five Whys Analysis

### Why 1: Why is mockWs null?

**Analysis**: The `mockWs` variable is declared as null and never gets assigned when the TestWebSocket constructor runs.

**Evidence from Code**:
```typescript
let mockWs = null;
const originalWebSocket = global.WebSocket;

// Create a custom WebSocket mock that allows us to send events
global.WebSocket = class TestWebSocket extends originalWebSocket {
  constructor(url) {
    super(url);
    mockWs = this;  // ← This assignment should set mockWs to the instance
    // Auto-connect
    setTimeout(() => this.onopen && this.onopen({}), 10);
  }
};
```

**Observation**: The test expects `mockWs` to be set, but it remains null.

---

### Why 2: Why is the WebSocket not being created/assigned properly?

**Analysis**: Looking at the test flow, the WebSocket constructor should be called when the `connect()` button is clicked, but there might be a timing or scoping issue.

**Evidence from Test Flow**:
```typescript
render(<AgentEventTestComponent authToken="load-test-user" />);

const connectButton = screen.getByTestId('connect-button');
await act(async () => {
  await userEvent.click(connectButton);
});

await waitFor(() => {
  expect(mockWs).toBeTruthy();  // ← This fails
});
```

**Key Issue**: The `mockWs` assignment happens in the constructor, but the constructor might not be called, or there's a scoping issue where the `mockWs` variable is not accessible.

---

### Why 3: Why is the component/mock not initializing the WebSocket reference?

**Analysis**: Looking at the `MockWebSocketConnection` component, the `connect()` function creates a WebSocket, but there might be an issue with:
1. The custom `TestWebSocket` class not properly extending the mock
2. The `global.WebSocket` replacement not taking effect 
3. A timing issue where the constructor runs but `mockWs` assignment fails

**Evidence from MockWebSocketConnection**:
```typescript
const connect = React.useCallback(() => {
  if (wsRef.current?.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) return;
  
  setConnectionStatus('connecting');
  
  const wsUrl = authToken ? `${url}?token=${authToken}` : url;
  const ws = new WebSocket(wsUrl);  // ← This should trigger TestWebSocket constructor
  
  // ... event handlers ...
  wsRef.current = ws;
}, [url, authToken, onMessage, onConnect, onDisconnect, onError, enableRetry, maxRetries, reconnectAttempts]);
```

**Root Cause Hypothesis**: The `TestWebSocket` class is extending `originalWebSocket` (which is the MockWebSocket from jest.setup.js), but there might be an issue with inheritance or constructor calling.

---

### Why 4: Why is there a timing/setup issue in the test?

**Analysis**: The issue is likely that the `TestWebSocket` class extending `originalWebSocket` creates a complex inheritance chain:
- `originalWebSocket` = `MockWebSocket` from jest.setup.js
- `TestWebSocket` extends `MockWebSocket`
- But `mockWs = this` assignment in constructor might not work properly

**Evidence from jest.setup.js MockWebSocket**:
```typescript
class MockWebSocket {
  constructor(url, protocols) {
    this.url = url + `-test-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;
    this.protocols = protocols || [];
    this.readyState = MockWebSocket.CONNECTING;
    // ... setup ...
    
    // Simulate realistic connection process
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (this.readyState === MockWebSocket.CONNECTING) {
        this.readyState = MockWebSocket.OPEN;
        const openEvent = new Event('open');
        this.onopen?.(openEvent);
        this.dispatchEvent(openEvent);
      }
    }, 10);
  }
}
```

**Key Problem**: When `TestWebSocket` extends `MockWebSocket`, the parent constructor creates its own timing logic, but the `mockWs = this` assignment might happen before the parent constructor completes, or the `this` reference might not be fully initialized.

---

### Why 5: Why is the test architecture not robust for async WebSocket initialization?

**Root Cause Identified**: The fundamental issue is that the test is creating an inheritance chain where:

1. `TestWebSocket extends MockWebSocket`
2. `MockWebSocket` constructor has asynchronous behavior (setTimeout for connection)
3. The `mockWs = this` assignment happens immediately in constructor
4. But the test expects `mockWs` to be available immediately after clicking connect

**The Real Issue**: The `TestWebSocket` constructor calls `super(url)` first, which triggers the `MockWebSocket` constructor. The `mockWs = this` assignment happens after `super()` returns, but there might be a scoping issue where the `mockWs` variable from the outer test scope is not being properly assigned.

**Evidence**: Looking at similar working tests, they use the WebSocket mock directly without creating a derived class, or they properly handle the scoping issue.

## Technical Analysis

### JavaScript Scoping Issue
The problem is likely a JavaScript closure/scoping issue. The `mockWs` variable is declared in the test function scope:

```typescript
test('should maintain connection stability with rapid events', async () => {
  let mockWs = null;  // ← Test function scope
  const originalWebSocket = global.WebSocket;
  
  // Create a custom WebSocket mock that allows us to send events
  global.WebSocket = class TestWebSocket extends originalWebSocket {
    constructor(url) {
      super(url);
      mockWs = this;  // ← Attempts to assign to outer scope
      // Auto-connect
      setTimeout(() => this.onopen && this.onopen({}), 10);
    }
  };
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Timing**: The assignment happens but gets overwritten
2. **Scoping**: The `mockWs` in constructor doesn't reference the test scope variable
3. **Inheritance**: The `super(url)` call has side effects that prevent proper assignment

### Business Impact Analysis
- **WebSocket events deliver 90% of platform business value** (per CLAUDE.md)
- This test validates "connection stability with rapid events" - critical for high-throughput AI interactions
- Failure means we cannot verify that WebSocket connections remain stable under load
- Risk: Production WebSocket connections may fail during high-activity periods, breaking chat experience

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix
1. **Fix the scoping issue** by ensuring `mockWs` assignment works properly
2. **Add debugging** to understand the exact failure point  
3. **Verify assignment timing** with console logs

### Phase 2: Robust Solution
1. **Refactor test architecture** to use a more reliable WebSocket mock pattern
2. **Implement proper cleanup** to prevent side effects between tests
3. **Add comprehensive validation** for WebSocket instance creation

### Phase 3: Verification
1. **Write reproducer test** that demonstrates the bug and validates fix
2. **Run full WebSocket test suite** to ensure no regressions
3. **Document the fix** for future reference

---

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED ✅

### Root Cause: Jest Setup Protection Against WebSocket Override

The issue was that `jest.setup.js` has a `defineProperty` that prevents direct override of `global.WebSocket`:

```javascript
Object.defineProperty(global, 'WebSocket', {
  get: () => MockWebSocket,
  set: (value) => {
    if (value !== MockWebSocket && typeof value === 'function' && value.name === 'WebSocket') {
      console.warn('Attempted to set real WebSocket in test environment - blocked');
      return; // BLOCKS OUR OVERRIDE
    }
    global._webSocketMock = value;
  },
```

### Fix Applied

Instead of fighting the Jest setup, I implemented a simpler, more reliable approach:

1. **Removed complex WebSocket override attempts**
2. **Used existing global tracking**: `global.mockWebSocketInstances`  
3. **Added manual instance tracking** in component
4. **Wait for connection status** rather than constructor calls
5. **Find active WebSocket instance** by checking readyState

### Code Changes

**Fixed Pattern (Applied to all affected tests):**
```typescript
// OLD (BROKEN): Try to override global.WebSocket and capture in mockWs
let mockWs = null;
global.WebSocket = class TestWebSocket extends originalWebSocket {
  constructor(url) {
    super(url);
    mockWs = this; // ❌ This assignment was blocked by jest.setup.js
  }
};

// NEW (WORKING): Use existing tracking and find active instance
render(<Component />);
await userEvent.click(connectButton);

// Wait for connection
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(screen.getByTestId('connection-status')).toHaveTextContent('connected');
});

// Find the active WebSocket instance from global tracking
let testWs = null;
await waitFor(() => {
  if (global.mockWebSocketInstances && global.mockWebSocketInstances.length > 0) {
    for (let i = global.mockWebSocketInstances.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      const instance = global.mockWebSocketInstances[i];
      if (instance && instance.readyState === 1) { // WebSocket.OPEN
        testWs = instance;
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  expect(testWs).toBeTruthy();
});
```

### Tests Fixed

1. ✅ **"should maintain connection stability with rapid events"** - MAIN TARGET TEST
2. ✅ **"should receive all 5 critical agent events in correct order"**
3. ✅ **"should handle malformed agent events gracefully"**

### Business Value Preserved

- **WebSocket connection stability testing** now works reliably
- **High-throughput event processing** validated (50 rapid events)
- **Real-time AI value delivery** through WebSocket events confirmed
- **90% of platform revenue** protected through stable chat infrastructure

## Key Learnings

1. **Jest Setup Can Block WebSocket Overrides** - Always check jest.setup.js for property descriptors
2. **Use Existing Infrastructure** - Global instance tracking was already available
3. **Test Real Functionality** - Focus on connection status and message flow rather than constructor calls
4. **Reliable > Complex** - Simple pattern works better than fighting the framework
