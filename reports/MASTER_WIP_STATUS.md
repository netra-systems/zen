  - Phase 4: Final remediation completed - ready for closure
  - Fast collection mode no longer reports false success
  - Truth-before-documentation principle implemented in test runner
  - Comprehensive anti-recursive validation tests created and verified
- ‚úÖ **Issue #1294 RESOLVED:** Secret loading silent failures - service account now has proper access
- ‚úÖ **JWT_SECRET/FERNET_KEY:** Made validation more lenient in staging to prevent startup failures
- ‚úÖ **Deployment Script Enhanced:** Now validates service account access BEFORE deployment
