## üìä Test Discovery Impact Analysis

### Hidden Test Inventory
Based on file analysis, the system contains significantly more tests than currently discoverable:

| Test Type | Files Found | Estimated Tests | Currently Discoverable | Discovery Rate |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Unit Tests | ~1,200 files | ~8,000 tests | ~160 tests | ~2% |
| Integration Tests | ~1,500 files | ~1,800 tests | ~280 tests | ~15% |
| E2E Tests | ~300 files | ~400 tests | ~65 tests | ~16% |
| Specialized Tests | ~885 files | ~183 tests | Unknown | Unknown |
| **TOTAL** | **3,885 files** | **~10,383 tests** | **~505 tests** | **~5%** |

### Business Risk Assessment
- **Regression Risk:** HIGH - Unknown test coverage hiding potential failures
- **Development Confidence:** LOW - Developers unaware of full test scope
- **CI/CD Reliability:** UNKNOWN - Pipeline may be running incomplete validation
- **Production Stability:** MEDIUM - Core services tested, but edge cases unknown
