# Critical Configuration Regression: Secret Loading Failure

## Executive Summary
**Date:** September 5, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Complete authentication failure in staging/production environments  
**Root Cause:** Configuration classes missing environment variable loading logic  
**Status:** FIXED - Awaiting deployment  

## Incident Timeline

### Discovery
- **Time:** 17:27 UTC, September 5, 2025
- **Symptom:** `SERVICE_SECRET` and other critical secrets not loading in GCP staging
- **Error:** "CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED: Configure SERVICE_ID and SERVICE_SECRET environment variables"
- **Impact:** Backend unable to authenticate with auth service, breaking all user authentication

### Investigation
1. Confirmed secrets exist in Google Secret Manager
2. Verified secrets are properly mounted by Cloud Run deployment
3. Discovered configuration classes (`StagingConfig`, `ProductionConfig`) lack methods to load secrets from environment

### Root Cause Analysis

The regression was introduced during the configuration system refactor when we moved to centralized secrets management (`deployment/secrets_config.py`). While the deployment correctly mounts secrets as environment variables, the configuration classes never had logic to read these environment variables.

**Critical Gap:**
- `StagingConfig` and `ProductionConfig` classes had no `_load_secrets_from_environment()` method
- Secrets were defined in schema but never populated from environment
- Only test configs had hardcoded values

## The Fix

Added `_load_secrets_from_environment()` method to both `StagingConfig` and `ProductionConfig`:

```python
def _load_secrets_from_environment(self, data: dict) -> None:
    """Load critical secrets from environment variables."""
    env = get_env()
    
    critical_secrets = [
        ('SERVICE_SECRET', 'service_secret'),
        ('SERVICE_ID', 'service_id'),
        ('JWT_SECRET_KEY', 'jwt_secret_key'),
        ('SECRET_KEY', 'secret_key'),
        ('FERNET_KEY', 'fernet_key'),
    ]
    
    for env_name, config_name in critical_secrets:
        if env_name in env and config_name not in data:
            data[config_name] = env.get(env_name)
```

**Important:** Secrets MUST be loaded BEFORE database URL construction since database password may come from secrets.

## Regression Prevention

### 1. Unit Tests Created
File: `tests/unit/test_config_secret_loading_regression.py`
- Tests that `SERVICE_SECRET` is loaded from environment
- Tests that all critical secrets are loaded
- Tests that secrets are loaded before database URL
- Tests for both staging and production configs

### 2. Critical Secrets List
The following secrets MUST be loaded from environment in staging/production:
- `SERVICE_SECRET` - Inter-service authentication
- `SERVICE_ID` - Service identification
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY` - JWT token signing
- `SECRET_KEY` - General encryption
- `FERNET_KEY` - Fernet encryption

### 3. Deployment Validation
- Deploy script validates all secrets exist before deployment
- Post-deployment tests verify authentication works

## Lessons Learned

1. **Configuration changes are high-risk** - Any change to config loading must be thoroughly tested
2. **Environment-specific testing is critical** - Local tests with hardcoded values don't catch production issues
3. **Secret loading must be explicit** - Don't assume environment variables are automatically available
4. **Deployment validation is essential** - Pre-flight checks prevent broken deployments

## Action Items

- [x] Fix configuration classes to load secrets from environment
- [x] Create regression prevention tests
- [x] Document the incident
- [ ] Deploy fix to staging
- [ ] Verify authentication works in staging
- [ ] Add monitoring for secret loading failures

## Monitoring Recommendations

Add alerts for:
- `SERVICE_SECRET configured: False` in logs
- `AUTH SERVICE UNREACHABLE` errors
- Circuit breaker open states
- Authentication failure rates > 1%

- `deployment/secrets_config.py` - Secret definitions
- `tests/unit/test_config_secret_loading_regression.py` - Regression tests
- `scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py` - Deployment script with secret validation

## Commands to Verify Fix

```bash
# Run regression tests locally
pytest tests/unit/test_config_secret_loading_regression.py -v

# Deploy to staging with validation
python scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py --project netra-staging --build-local --run-checks

# Check logs after deployment
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND \"SERVICE_SECRET\"" --limit=10
```

## Approval

This fix is CRITICAL and must be deployed immediately to restore authentication functionality.
