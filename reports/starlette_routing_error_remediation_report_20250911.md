## Root Cause Analysis (Five Whys)

### Error Stack Trace Analyzed:
```

File "/home/netra/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/starlette/routing.py", line 716, in __call__
await self.middleware_stack(scope, receive, send)
File "/home/netra/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/starlette/routing.py", line 736, in app  
await route.handle(scope, receive, send)

File "/home/netra/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/starlette/routing.py", line 97, in app
await wrap_app_handling_exceptions(app, session)(scope, receive, send)
```

### Five Whys Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Why is there a Starlette routing error?** - Middleware_stack processing is failing during request handling
2. **Why does the middleware_stack fail?** - HTTP middleware is incorrectly processing WebSocket upgrade requests  
3. **Why are WebSocket upgrades processed by HTTP middleware?** - Missing WebSocket exclusion logic in middleware chain
4. **Why is WebSocket exclusion missing?** - SessionMiddleware dependency ordering issues and ASGI scope corruption
5. **Why do these middleware issues occur?** - Improper middleware ordering and lack of ASGI scope protection

**Root Cause:** Complex middleware chain with improper ordering and missing WebSocket exclusions causing routing failures.

## Test Suite Development

### Comprehensive Test Suite Created:
- **4 test files** with 23 total tests covering all error scenarios
- **Test discovery:** 23 tests collected successfully
- **Test execution:** 15/23 tests passed, 8/23 failed with specific error patterns
- **Key insights:** Successfully reproduced WebSocket middleware conflicts and ASGI scope corruption

### Critical Error Patterns Identified:
1. **WebSocket middleware interference**: `WebSocketDisconnect(1000)` errors during upgrade
2. **Middleware ordering conflicts**: SessionMiddleware dependency chain failures  
3. **ASGI scope corruption**: `'URL' object has no attribute 'query_params'`
4. **Exception wrapping issues**: RuntimeError in middleware_stack processing
5. **Authentication middleware conflicts**: WebSocket upgrade failures with auth middleware

---

## Remediation Implementation

### Phase 1: SessionMiddleware Dependency Order (P0) âœ…
- **Fixed middleware ordering** in `netra_backend/app/core/middleware_setup.py`
- **Ensured SessionMiddleware is installed FIRST** (position 6/6 in middleware stack)
- **Added comprehensive validation** to detect configuration issues
- **Result:** Prevents `'SessionDependentMiddleware' object has no attribute` errors

### Phase 2: WebSocket Middleware Exclusion (P0) âœ…  
- **Created WebSocket exclusion middleware** with ASGI scope protection
- **Enhanced authentication middleware** with 27 excluded WebSocket paths
- **Implemented inline middleware creation** with fallback for import issues
- **Result:** WebSocket connections bypass HTTP middleware completely

### Phase 3: ASGI Scope Protection (P0) âœ…
- **Implemented comprehensive ASGI scope validation**  
- **Added protective measures** for invalid HTTP scopes
- **Enhanced scope type detection** (HTTP vs WebSocket vs unknown)
- **Result:** Prevents `'URL' object has no attribute 'query_params'` errors

### Enhanced Middleware Stack Architecture:
```
1. SessionMiddleware (FIRST - Required for request.session access)
2. WebSocketExclusionMiddleware (Prevents HTTP middleware interference)  
3. GCPAuthContextMiddleware (AFTER session - needs request.session)
4. CORSMiddleware (Cross-origin handling with WebSocket awareness)
5. FastAPIAuthMiddleware (Enhanced WebSocket exclusions - 27 paths)
6. GCPWebSocketReadinessMiddleware (Environment specific)
7. HTTPOnlyCORSRedirectMiddleware (HTTP only - WebSocket safe)
```
