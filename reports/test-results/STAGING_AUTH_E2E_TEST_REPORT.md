# Staging Authentication Cross-System E2E Test Report

**Date:** September 1, 2025  
**Environment:** GCP Staging  
**Test Focus:** Critical authentication cross-system integration

## Executive Summary

**Overall Status:** 6/7 tests passed with 1 critical issue identified  
**System Status:** Authentication system mostly functional with cross-service token validation issue

### Key Findings

✅ **Working Systems:**
- Auth service health monitoring (degraded but functional)
- Backend configuration management  
- User registration flow
- User login flow with token generation
- Race condition protection (single token per concurrent login)
- Invalid token rejection

❌ **Critical Issue:**
- **Cross-Service Token Validation Failure:** Tokens issued by auth service are rejected by backend service (401 status)

## Detailed Test Results

### Test Environment Discovery

**Corrected Service URLs:**
- **Auth Service:** `https://auth.staging.netrasystems.ai` ✅
- **Backend Service:** `https://netra-backend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app` ✅

*Note: Initial URL `https://netra-auth-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app` was incorrect and returned 404 for all endpoints.*

### Test 1: Auth Service Health ✅ PASS
- **Status:** 200 OK
- **Service Status:** "degraded" 
- **Issues:** Redis not connected, database connected
- **Impact:** Service functional despite Redis connectivity issue

```json
{
  "status": "degraded",
  "service": "auth-service", 
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "redis_connected": false,
  "database_connected": true
}
```

### Test 2: Backend Auth Configuration ✅ PASS
- **Status:** 200 OK
- **Endpoints Configured:** 9 auth endpoints
- **Configuration:** Complete auth endpoint mapping available

### Test 3: User Registration ✅ PASS
- **Backend Registration:** 200 OK - Successful
- **User Creation:** Successfully created test user
- **Password Requirements:** Enforces strong password requirements

### Test 4: User Login ✅ PASS
- **Auth Service Login:** 200 OK - Token generated (508 characters)
- **Backend Login:** 500 Internal Server Error
- **Token Generation:** Working via auth service
- **Issue:** Backend login endpoint has internal errors

### Test 5: Cross-Service Token Validation ❌ FAIL (CRITICAL)
- **Backend Token Validation:** 401 Unauthorized
- **Auth Service Verification:** 200 OK
- **Issue:** Tokens valid in auth service but rejected by backend
- **Impact:** Cross-service authentication broken

### Test 6: Race Condition Protection ✅ PASS
- **Concurrent Attempts:** 5 simultaneous logins
- **Successful Logins:** 1/5 (good - prevents multiple sessions)
- **Token Uniqueness:** Single token issued (no duplicates)
- **Conclusion:** Race condition protection working correctly

### Test 7: Invalid Token Handling ✅ PASS
- **Invalid Tokens Tested:** Multiple malformed tokens
- **Response:** All properly rejected with 401 status
- **Security:** Invalid token rejection working correctly

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Cross-Service Token Validation Failure (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Tokens issued by the auth service (`https://auth.staging.netrasystems.ai`) are being rejected by the backend service (`https://netra-backend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app`) with a 401 Unauthorized response.

**Expected Behavior:** Tokens issued by auth service should be accepted by backend service for cross-service authentication.

**Current Behavior:** 
- Auth service issues tokens successfully (200 OK)
- Auth service can verify its own tokens (200 OK) 
- Backend service rejects tokens from auth service (401 Unauthorized)

**Business Impact:** This breaks the fundamental cross-service authentication, preventing users from accessing backend services after logging in through the auth service.

**Root Cause Hypotheses:**
1. JWT secret key mismatch between services
2. Token signature validation differences
3. Token audience/issuer claim validation issues
4. Clock synchronization issues (token timing)
5. Missing or incorrect service-to-service communication configuration

### 2. Auth Service Redis Connectivity (WARNING)

**Problem:** Auth service shows "degraded" status due to Redis connection failure.

**Impact:** May affect session management, caching, and performance.

## Infrastructure Observations

### Auth Service Status
- **Overall:** Degraded but functional
- **Database:** Connected ✅
- **Redis:** Not connected ❌
- **API:** Responding correctly to requests

### Backend Service Status  
- **Overall:** Functional with issues
- **Health:** Healthy (200 OK)
- **Auth Endpoints:** Available but some returning 500 errors
- **Cross-service validation:** Failing

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Fix Cross-Service Token Validation**
   - Verify JWT secret key synchronization between auth service and backend
   - Check token audience/issuer validation logic
   - Ensure both services use identical JWT validation libraries and configurations
   - Test token format and claims structure

2. **Investigate Backend Login Endpoint**
   - Backend `/api/v1/auth/login` returning 500 errors
   - May indicate internal service communication issues

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2)

1. **Fix Auth Service Redis Connectivity**
   - Investigate Redis connection configuration
   - Verify Redis service availability in staging environment

2. **Comprehensive Integration Testing**
   - Implement continuous monitoring of cross-service authentication
   - Add automated tests for token validation flows

### Long-term Actions (Priority 3)

1. **Service Discovery and Configuration Management**
   - Implement proper service discovery to avoid URL hardcoding issues
   - Centralized configuration management for cross-service settings

## Test Coverage Assessment

The tests successfully validated:
- ✅ Service availability and health monitoring
- ✅ User registration and authentication flows  
- ✅ Concurrency and race condition handling
- ✅ Security token validation (invalid tokens)
- ❌ Cross-service token propagation (FAILED)

## Conclusion

The staging authentication system is largely functional but has a **critical cross-service token validation issue** that prevents proper integration between the auth service and backend service. This issue must be resolved before the system can be considered production-ready.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize fixing the cross-service token validation issue
2. Investigate and resolve backend login endpoint errors
3. Address Redis connectivity for the auth service
4. Implement comprehensive cross-service integration monitoring

The test framework successfully identified these issues and provides a foundation for ongoing validation of authentication system integrity.
