## 🚨 DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION PLAN

### 5-Phase Zero-Downtime Strategy:

**Phase 1: Staging Deployment (4 hours)**
- Deploy token optimization to staging environment
- Run comprehensive test suite (integration + E2E)
- Execute load testing (150 concurrent users, 1 hour)
- Validate all business logic and cost calculations

**Phase 2: Production Preparation (2 hours)**  
- Upload production configuration to Secret Manager
- Update database schema with token optimization tables
- Configure production monitoring and alerting
- Verify all secrets and environment variables

**Phase 3: Canary Deployment (1 hour + monitoring)**
- Deploy new version to production (0% traffic)
- Health check all services
- Shift 10% traffic to new version
- Monitor for 1 hour (error rate, latency, optimization success)

**Phase 4: Traffic Increase (1 hour + monitoring)**
- Increase to 50% traffic if metrics healthy
- Monitor business metrics activation
- Validate user experience and cost tracking
- Confirm WebSocket events delivering properly

**Phase 5: Full Rollout (30 minutes)**
- Shift 100% traffic to new version  
- Update all services (backend, auth, frontend)
- Create deployment Git tag
- Activate business metrics collection

### Rollback Procedures:

**Immediate Rollback** (< 5 minutes):
```bash
# Emergency traffic rollback
gcloud run services update-traffic netra-backend-prod \
  --to-revisions netra-backend-prod-previous=100

# Disable token optimization  
gcloud secrets versions add prod-feature-flags \
  --data-file rollback_config.json
```

**Database Rollback** (< 15 minutes):
```bash
# Restore pre-deployment backup
gcloud sql backups restore backup-pre-token-optimization \
  --restore-instance netra-production-db
```
