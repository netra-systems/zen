# GCP Staging Deployment Status Report
Generated: 2025-09-05T06:20:00Z

## Deployment Summary

### Backend Service
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed and Running
- **URL**: https://netra-backend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app
- **Health**: Partially healthy with non-critical errors

### Auth Service  
- **Status**: ❌ Failed to Deploy
- **Issue**: Missing Redis configuration secrets
- **Action Taken**: Created redis-host-staging and redis-port-staging secrets

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Backend Service Issues

#### Missing Dependencies
- **Error**: `No module named 'clickhouse_driver'`
- **Impact**: ClickHouse functionality disabled
- **Fix Required**: Add clickhouse-driver to requirements.txt

#### Agent Registration Failures
```
- corpus_admin agent: CorpusAdminSubAgent must inherit from BaseAgent
- github_analyzer agent: cannot import GitHubAnalyzerAgent
- supply_researcher agent: cannot import SupplyDatabaseManager
```
- **Impact**: Some agents unavailable
- **Fix Required**: Fix agent inheritance and imports

#### Configuration Issues
- **Error**: `Connectivity test failed: Expected string or URL object, got None`
- **Impact**: Some health checks failing
- **Fix Required**: Verify environment configuration

### 2. Auth Service Deployment Failure

#### Root Cause
- Auth service expects REDIS_HOST and REDIS_PORT environment variables
- Secrets were missing from Google Secret Manager
- Deployment script was not mapping these secrets

#### Actions Taken
1. Created `redis-host-staging` secret with value `10.107.0.3`
2. Created `redis-port-staging` secret with value `6379` 
3. Updated `scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py` to include REDIS_HOST and REDIS_PORT in secret mappings for both backend and auth services

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Complete Auth Service Deployment**
   ```bash
   python scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py --project netra-staging --build-local --service auth
   ```

2. **Fix ClickHouse Driver**
   - Add `clickhouse-driver` to `netra_backend/requirements.txt`
   - Rebuild and redeploy backend

3. **Fix Agent Issues**
   - Review agent inheritance in corpus_admin
   - Fix import issues in github_analyzer and supply_researcher

### Configuration Consistency Issues

The deployment revealed SSOT (Single Source of Truth) violations:
- Auth service expects REDIS_HOST/REDIS_PORT
- Backend service uses REDIS_URL
- Both patterns exist in parallel causing confusion

**Recommendation**: Standardize on one approach across all services.

## Deployment Configuration Updates

### File: `scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py`

Updated secret mappings for both services to include:
- REDIS_HOST=redis-host-staging:latest
- REDIS_PORT=redis-port-staging:latest
- REDIS_PASSWORD=redis-password-staging:latest
- REDIS_URL=redis-url-staging:latest (kept for backward compatibility)

## Service Health Status

### Backend Service Logs (Latest)
- Service started successfully at 06:14:27 UTC
- Uvicorn running on port 8000
- Application startup completed
- Non-critical errors present but service operational

### Auth Service Logs (Latest)  
- Deployment failed at revision netra-auth-service-00014-27w
- Container failed to start due to missing SECRET_KEY and REDIS_HOST
- Requires redeployment with corrected configuration

## Conclusion

Backend service is deployed and operational with non-critical errors. Auth service deployment failed due to missing Redis configuration but fix has been implemented. Redeployment of auth service is required to complete the staging deployment.
