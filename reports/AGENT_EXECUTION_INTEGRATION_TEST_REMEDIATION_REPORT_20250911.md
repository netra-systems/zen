## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. **MCP Dependency Collection Blocker** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp.types'` preventing test collection  
**Impact**: Integration tests completely blocked, 0% discoverability  
**Solution**: Enhanced MCP route conditional loading with graceful degradation  
**Validation**: All MCP dependencies confirmed functional, tests collecting successfully  

### 2. **Test Marker Configuration Crisis** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Issue**: `'isolation'` and `'websocket_messaging'` markers not found in pytest configuration  
**Impact**: Critical business logic tests undiscoverable  
**Solution**: Added missing markers to both root and backend pytest.ini files  
**Files Modified**: 2 pytest configuration files updated  

### 3. **UserExecutionContext API Incompatibilities** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Issue**: Multiple `TypeError` exceptions from outdated API usage patterns  
**Examples**: 
- `metadata=` parameter ‚Üí `agent_context=` parameter
- `additional_metadata=` ‚Üí `additional_agent_context=`  
**Impact**: 24+ test files with instantiation failures  
**Solution**: Updated API calls to match current UserExecutionContext implementation  

### 4. **AgentExecutionTracker Missing Method** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Issue**: `AttributeError: 'AgentExecutionTracker' object has no attribute 'get_default_timeout'`  
**Impact**: Core agent execution engine failing during timeout configuration  
**Solution**: Added missing `get_default_timeout()` method returning proper timeout value  
**Location**: `netra_backend/app/core/agent_execution_tracker.py`

### 5. **DeepAgentState Pydantic Validation Errors** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Issue**: `ValidationError: Input should be a valid string [type=string_type]`  
**Root Cause**: Tests passing dictionary objects instead of strings for `user_request`/`user_prompt`  
**Impact**: 17 test files with state creation failures  
**Solution**: Corrected all DeepAgentState instantiations to use proper string values
