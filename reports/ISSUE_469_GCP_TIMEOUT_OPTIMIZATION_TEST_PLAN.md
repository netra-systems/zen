# Issue #469: GCP Timeout Optimization - Comprehensive Test Plan

**Generated:** 2025-09-11  
**Issue:** [#469] GCP timeout optimization following TEST_CREATION_GUIDE.md and CLAUDE.md  
**Priority:** P2 - Performance Optimization  
**Business Impact:** Optimize GCP timeout configurations to improve system performance and reduce latency

## üéØ Testing Objectives

**PRIMARY GOAL:** Create comprehensive failing tests that reproduce current timeout misconfiguration issues, then validate optimized timeout behavior.

**KEY FOCUS AREAS:**
1. **Auth Timeout Performance** - Current 1.5s vs actual 57ms response time measurement
2. **Buffer Utilization Monitoring** - Dynamic timeout adjustment under different load conditions  
3. **Configuration Validation** - Timeout configuration loading and GCP environment detection
4. **Integration Performance** - End-to-end timeout behavior in real scenarios
5. **E2E Staging Validation** - Real GCP environment timeout measurement and optimization

## üèóÔ∏è Test Architecture Overview

Following SSOT testing patterns from CLAUDE.md:
- **REAL SERVICES FIRST:** All integration/E2E tests use real services (no mocks)
- **SSOT COMPLIANCE:** All tests inherit from SSotBaseTestCase/SSotAsyncTestCase
- **STAGING VALIDATION:** E2E tests run against actual GCP staging environment
- **NO DOCKER DEPENDENCY:** Tests designed for non-docker execution or staging GCP
