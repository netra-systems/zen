## üö® CRITICAL VIOLATIONS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE FIXES

### VIOLATION #1: Mocking in Cross-Service Tests (CRITICAL)
**File:** `auth_service/tests/integration/test_cross_service_auth_validation.py`  
**Lines:** 746-768, Line 39  
**Severity:** HIGH  

**Issue:** Uses `unittest.mock` and mocked responses for timeout testing, violating CLAUDE.md "NO MOCKS" requirement for integration tests.

**Fix Required:**
```python
# REMOVE: Mock-based timeout testing
# REPLACE WITH: Real slow service endpoint or network delay simulation
async def test_timeout_scenarios():
    # Use real slow endpoint or configure actual timeout
    slow_endpoint_url = "http://httpbin.org/delay/3"  # Real slow service
    # Test actual timeout handling
```

### VIOLATION #2: Import Statement Cleanup
**File:** `auth_service/tests/integration/test_cross_service_auth_validation.py`  
**Line:** 39  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  

**Issue:** Import of `unittest.mock` should be removed entirely.
