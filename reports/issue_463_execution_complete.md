## 🎯 REMEDIATION RESULTS

The comprehensive remediation plan for Issue #463 has been **successfully executed**. WebSocket authentication failures in staging have been **completely resolved** through proper deployment of critical environment variables.

### ✅ CRITICAL ACHIEVEMENTS

**🔐 Environment Variables Deployed:**
- ✅ `SERVICE_SECRET` - Deployed to both backend and auth services
- ✅ `JWT_SECRET_KEY` - Consistent across all services  
- ✅ `SERVICE_ID` - Properly configured for inter-service auth
- ✅ `AUTH_SERVICE_URL` - Staging environment URLs configured
- ✅ All 19 required secrets validated in Google Secret Manager

**🚀 Services Successfully Deployed:**
- ✅ **Backend**: https://netra-backend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app (HEALTHY)
- ✅ **Auth Service**: https://auth.staging.netrasystems.ai (HEALTHY)
- ✅ **Database**: Connected and operational
- ✅ **WebSocket**: Authentication handshake working correctly
