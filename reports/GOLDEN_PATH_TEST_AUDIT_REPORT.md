## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES & REMEDIATION

### Priority 1: Authentication Compliance
- **Issue:** 66 tests violate CLAUDE.md auth requirements
- **Business Risk:** Multi-user bugs could cause data leakage
- **Solution:** Implement `E2EAuthHelper` in all E2E/Integration tests
- **Timeline:** Critical - Address within 1 sprint

### Priority 2: Test Execution Reliability  
- **Issue:** 4 test files failed basic validation
- **Business Risk:** CI/CD pipeline instability
- **Solution:** Fix syntax/import errors in failing tests
- **Timeline:** High - Address within 2 days

### Priority 3: WebSocket Event Coverage
- **Issue:** Chat experience testing gaps
- **Business Risk:** Revenue loss from poor user experience  
- **Solution:** Add WebSocket event validation to all agent tests
- **Timeline:** Medium - Address within 2 sprints
