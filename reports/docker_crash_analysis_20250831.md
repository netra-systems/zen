# Docker Crash Analysis Report - August 31, 2025

## Executive Summary
Docker services were crashing due to a missing backward compatibility alias in the auth integration module. The issue was introduced when refactoring the authentication system in the last 72 hours.

## Root Cause
**Primary Issue:** The `get_current_active_user` function alias was removed from `netra_backend/app/auth_integration/auth.py`, causing an ImportError that prevented the backend service from starting.

## Timeline of Changes (Last 72 Hours)
1. **Config Refactoring (commit 320f13c8c)**: Migrated to unified configuration and environment management
2. **Frontend Docker Optimization (commit 46ac19a05)**: Improved frontend Docker image build process
3. **Resource Adjustments (commit 0602e1e71)**: Increased backend/frontend resources from 512MB/0.5CPU to 3G/1.5CPU
4. **Auth Refactoring**: Removed backward compatibility alias `get_current_active_user`

## Impact
- Backend service failed to start with ImportError
- All dependent services crashed due to Docker health checks
- Complete system outage

## Resolution Applied
Added the missing backward compatibility alias:
```python
# Alias for backward compatibility
get_current_active_user = get_current_user
```

## Verification
âœ… All services now running and healthy:
- netra-dev-frontend: Up and healthy
- netra-dev-backend: Up and healthy  
- netra-dev-auth: Up and healthy
- netra-dev-redis: Up and healthy
- netra-dev-postgres: Up and healthy
- netra-dev-clickhouse: Up and healthy

Backend health endpoint responding correctly:
```json
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "service": "netra-ai-platform",
    "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Recommendations
1. **Always maintain backward compatibility** when refactoring authentication modules
2. **Run integration tests** before removing function aliases
3. **Document deprecations** before removing them
4. **Consider using `@deprecated` decorators** instead of immediate removal

## Lessons Learned
- Authentication module changes have system-wide impact
- Backward compatibility aliases are critical for system stability
- Docker health checks properly cascade failures (good for reliability)
- Resource increases (3G/1.5CPU) appear appropriate for Windows development environment
