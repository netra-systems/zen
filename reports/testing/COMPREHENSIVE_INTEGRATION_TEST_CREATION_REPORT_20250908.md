#### WebSocket Events Validation
All 5 critical WebSocket events tested:
- `agent_started` - User sees agent began processing
- `agent_thinking` - Real-time reasoning visibility  
- `tool_executing` - Tool usage transparency
- `tool_completed` - Tool results display
- `agent_completed` - User knows response is ready

### Integration Testing Best Practices

#### Real Services Integration
- **Real PostgreSQL** connections via `DatabaseManager`
- **Real Redis** connections for caching validation
- **Real WebSocket** connections for event testing
- **Minimal Mocking** - Only external LLM APIs mocked (CLAUDE.md compliant)
