**Test Methods:** 15  
**Coverage Focus:** Service interactions, factory isolation, caching, error recovery

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Factory pattern creates isolated agents per user
- Database storage and retrieval of triage results
- Redis caching for performance optimization
- WebSocket event delivery with user isolation
- Error recovery when services are unavailable
- Concurrent user execution with proper isolation

**Business Value:** Validates triage integration with all infrastructure components required for production

### 3. E2E Tests (`tests/e2e/test_triage_golden_path_complete.py`)
**Lines of Code:** 1,800+  
**Test Methods:** 10  
**Coverage Focus:** Complete user journey, authentication, real services

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Complete authentication flow with real JWT/OAuth
- Real WebSocket connections with actual event delivery
- Concurrent multi-user scenarios (5+ users simultaneously)
- Race condition prevention in Cloud Run environments
- Real LLM integration for authentic triage analysis
- Performance requirements validation

**Business Value:** Validates complete $500K+ ARR user journey from authentication to AI insights

## System Fixes Applied

### Unit Test Fixes
1. **Request Extraction Logic**: Fixed state format handling to check for non-empty values
2. **Intent Detection**: Expanded action keywords for better detection of user intentions
3. **Invalid Request Handling**: Added proper dict conversion for consistent return types
4. **Data Sufficiency**: Fixed fallback logic to use valid enum values

### Integration Test Fixes
1. **Python 3.13 Compatibility**: Replaced deprecated `asyncio.coroutine` with `AsyncMock()`
2. **Async Pattern Modernization**: Updated all async mocking to use current standards

### E2E Test Fixes
1. **Auth Integration**: Added missing `get_auth_client()` function to auth module
2. **Import Resolution**: Fixed all import errors to align with actual system implementation
