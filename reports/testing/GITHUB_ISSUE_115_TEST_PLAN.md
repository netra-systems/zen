# TEST PLAN: GitHub Issue #115 - Critical System User Authentication Failure

## Issue Summary

**Issue**: Critical: System User Authentication Failure Blocking Golden Path  
**Root Cause**: Missing `SERVICE_ID` and `SERVICE_SECRET` in `docker-compose.staging.yml` backend service  
**Business Impact**: Complete Golden Path failure - 403 'Not authenticated' errors for all system operations  
**Priority**: P0 - Complete system outage blocking all user flows  

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)

- **Segment**: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise) - Complete platform failure
- **Business Goal**: Restore system user authentication to enable Golden Path workflows
- **Value Impact**: Prevents 100% user lockout and enables core AI optimization features
- **Strategic Impact**: Critical for platform reliability and customer trust

## Test Plan Overview

This test plan follows the comprehensive testing methodology from `reports/testing/TEST_CREATION_GUIDE.md` and CLAUDE.md requirements:

1. **REPRODUCE THE ISSUE** - Tests that demonstrate the current 403 authentication failures
2. **VALIDATE THE FIX** - Tests that verify proper authentication after configuration changes  
3. **PREVENT REGRESSION** - Tests that ensure the issue doesn't reoccur

### Test Categories (per CLAUDE.md)

- **Unit Tests**: Service authentication component logic validation
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-service authentication flows (no Docker required)
- **E2E Tests**: Complete Golden Path validation on staging (GCP remote)

### Critical Constraints

✅ **NO Docker tests** - Only unit, integration (non-Docker), or E2E on staging GCP  
✅ **NO Mocks in E2E/Integration** - Real services only  
✅ **All E2E tests MUST use authentication** - Real JWT/OAuth flows  
✅ **Tests must RAISE ERRORS** - No try/except blocks that hide failures

## 📊 TEST EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Execute Reproduction Tests (Should FAIL)

```bash
# Unit tests - Should FAIL initially
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file tests/unit/test_system_user_auth_failure_reproduction.py

# Integration tests - Should FAIL initially  
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file tests/integration/test_service_auth_failure_reproduction.py

# E2E tests on staging - Should FAIL initially
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file tests/e2e/test_golden_path_auth_failure_reproduction.py --env staging
```

### Phase 2: Apply Configuration Fix

1. Edit `docker-compose.staging.yml` to add `SERVICE_ID` and `SERVICE_SECRET` to backend environment
2. Redeploy staging environment
3. Verify configuration is applied

### Phase 3: Execute Validation Tests (Should PASS)

```bash
# Unit tests - Should PASS after fix
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file tests/unit/test_service_auth_config_fix_validation.py

# Integration tests - Should PASS after fix
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file tests/integration/test_service_auth_success_validation.py

# E2E tests on staging - Should PASS after fix
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file tests/e2e/test_golden_path_restoration_validation.py --env staging
```

### Phase 4: Execute Regression Prevention Tests

```bash
# Mission critical tests - Should PASS and prevent future regressions
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file tests/mission_critical/test_service_auth_regression_prevention.py
```

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### ✅ Issue Reproduction Success Criteria

- [ ] All Phase 1 tests FAIL with authentication-related errors
- [ ] Tests clearly demonstrate missing SERVICE_ID/SERVICE_SECRET configuration
- [ ] Tests reproduce the exact 403 'Not authenticated' errors from dependencies.py
- [ ] Tests prove Golden Path is completely broken

### ✅ Fix Validation Success Criteria

- [ ] All Phase 2 tests PASS after configuration changes
- [ ] System user authentication works without 403 errors
- [ ] Golden Path flows complete successfully end-to-end
- [ ] WebSocket connections are stable and functional
- [ ] All 5 critical WebSocket events are sent per CLAUDE.md requirements

### ✅ Regression Prevention Success Criteria

- [ ] All Phase 4 tests PASS and will catch future configuration drift
- [ ] Configuration is documented as mission-critical
- [ ] All Docker Compose files have consistent service authentication

---

## 🔍 DEBUGGING GUIDES

### Common Test Failures and Solutions

1. **Tests don't fail as expected in Phase 1**:
   - Check if SERVICE_ID/SECRET are already configured somewhere
   - Verify test environment isolation is working
   - Check if fallback authentication is bypassing the issue

2. **Tests still fail in Phase 2 after configuration fix**:
   - Verify staging deployment actually applied the configuration
   - Check Docker Compose environment variable syntax
   - Validate SECRET values are long enough and properly formatted

3. **E2E tests timeout or connection issues**:
   - Verify staging environment is running and accessible
   - Check WebSocket endpoint configuration
   - Validate authentication tokens are properly generated

---

## 📋 FINAL CHECKLIST

- [ ] All test files created following CLAUDE.md testing standards
- [ ] Tests use real services (no mocks in integration/E2E)
- [ ] All E2E tests use real authentication (JWT/OAuth flows)
- [ ] Tests raise errors (no try/except blocks hiding failures)
- [ ] Test files placed in correct directories per folder structure rules
- [ ] Business Value Justification (BVJ) included for all test suites
- [ ] Tests follow the "fail first, then pass" methodology
- [ ] Configuration fix clearly documented
- [ ] Regression prevention measures in place

---

**This test plan provides comprehensive coverage for GitHub issue #115, ensuring the authentication failure is properly reproduced, fixed, and prevented from recurring. The plan follows all CLAUDE.md requirements and uses the established testing framework patterns.**
