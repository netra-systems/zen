# Issue #1192 Service Dependency Integration Test Plan

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive test plan addresses Issue #1192 - Service Dependency Integration with graceful degradation patterns. The plan focuses on creating tests that **initially fail** to expose current service dependency issues, then guide implementation of proper graceful degradation patterns that ensure the Golden Path continues operating when non-critical services are unavailable.

**Business Value Justification:**
- **Segment:** Platform (All Segments)
- **Business Goal:** Revenue Protection & Service Reliability
- **Value Impact:** Ensures $500K+ ARR chat functionality never completely fails due to service dependencies
- **Strategic Impact:** Validates business continuity during service outages

## Test Infrastructure Analysis

Based on analysis of existing tests, we have:

### Existing Circuit Breaker Tests
- `tests/mission_critical/test_circuit_breaker_comprehensive.py` - Advanced cascade failure prevention
- `tests/mission_critical/test_agent_resilience_patterns.py` - Agent-level resilience

### Existing Graceful Degradation Tests
- `tests/integration/test_graceful_degradation_service_dependencies.py` - Service dependency graceful degradation
- `tests/integration/test_health_endpoints.py` - Health monitoring validation

### Existing Health Monitoring Tests
- `tests/health_monitoring/` directory with staging health monitors and API endpoint validation

## Test Plan Structure

The following test files will be created, designed to **initially fail** and expose current service dependency issues:

## 1. Integration Tests

### 1.1 `tests/integration/test_service_dependency_integration.py`

**Purpose:** Main integration tests for service dependencies with circuit breaker patterns

**Test Scenarios That Should Initially Fail:**

```python
async def test_golden_path_with_redis_unavailable():
    """SHOULD FAIL: Golden Path continues when Redis is down."""
    # Simulate Redis service failure
    # Verify chat functionality continues with degraded caching

async def test_golden_path_with_monitoring_service_down():
    """SHOULD FAIL: Golden Path continues when monitoring service unavailable."""
    # Disable monitoring service endpoints
    # Verify core chat flow works without metrics collection

async def test_circuit_breaker_prevents_cascade_failures():
    """SHOULD FAIL: Circuit breakers prevent one service failure from cascading."""
    # Trigger analytics service failure
    # Verify it doesn't break WebSocket connections or agent execution

async def test_service_recovery_detection():
    """SHOULD FAIL: System automatically detects when services recover."""
    # Simulate service recovery after failure
    # Verify automatic reconnection and circuit breaker reset
```

**Expected Failure Patterns:**
- Tests will fail with timeouts waiting for Redis operations
- Monitoring service failures will cause 500 errors in non-critical endpoints
- No circuit breakers implemented to prevent cascade failures
- No automatic service recovery detection

### 1.2 `tests/integration/test_graceful_degradation.py`

**Purpose:** Enhanced graceful degradation patterns beyond existing tests

**Test Scenarios That Should Initially Fail:**

```python
async def test_websocket_events_with_degraded_services():
    """SHOULD FAIL: All 5 WebSocket events sent even with service degradation."""
    # Disable analytics and monitoring services
    # Verify agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, tool_completed, agent_completed events

async def test_fallback_responses_quality():
    """SHOULD FAIL: Fallback responses provide meaningful user guidance."""
    # Test fallback handler responses during service degradation
    # Verify responses explain limitations and recovery time estimates

async def test_user_notification_of_degraded_capabilities():
    """SHOULD FAIL: Users are properly notified of temporary limitations."""
    # Trigger partial service degradation
    # Verify clear communication about what still works vs. what's limited
```

### 1.3 `tests/integration/test_service_health_monitoring.py`

**Purpose:** Health monitoring validation with service dependency awareness

**Test Scenarios That Should Initially Fail:**

```python
async def test_health_endpoint_with_dependency_failures():
    """SHOULD FAIL: Health endpoints distinguish critical vs non-critical failures."""
    # Fail Redis (non-critical for health)
    # Fail PostgreSQL (critical for health)
    # Verify health endpoint returns appropriate status codes

async def test_circuit_breaker_health_integration():
    """SHOULD FAIL: Health endpoints reflect circuit breaker states."""
    # Trigger circuit breaker opening
    # Verify health endpoint shows degraded but operational status

async def test_service_dependency_health_aggregation():
    """SHOULD FAIL: Overall health aggregates individual service states properly."""
    # Mix of healthy and degraded services
    # Verify overall system health calculation logic
```

## 2. E2E Resilience Tests

### 2.1 `tests/e2e/test_golden_path_resilience.py`

**Purpose:** E2E resilience testing on staging GCP environment

**Test Scenarios That Should Initially Fail:**

```python
async def test_complete_user_journey_with_redis_failure():
    """SHOULD FAIL: Complete user login -> agent chat flow works without Redis."""
    # Test on staging.netrasystems.ai
    # Simulate Redis unavailability via network policies
    # Verify complete Golden Path user flow

async def test_multi_user_isolation_during_service_degradation():
    """SHOULD FAIL: User isolation maintained during partial service failures."""
    # Multiple concurrent users on staging
    # Fail analytics service for some users
    # Verify isolation and no cross-contamination

async def test_agent_execution_resilience_staging():
    """SHOULD FAIL: Agent execution completes on staging with monitoring service down."""
    # Disable non-critical monitoring endpoints
    # Execute real agent workflows
    # Verify all WebSocket events sent and business value delivered
```

**Critical Requirements for Staging Tests:**
- Must use real GCP staging URLs: `*.staging.netrasystems.ai`
- Cannot use Docker (Cloud Run environment)
- Must test with real authentication and WebSocket connections
- Must validate actual business value delivery

## 3. Detailed Test Specifications

### Service Failure Simulation

**Redis Failure Simulation:**
```python
# Network-level simulation for staging
async def simulate_redis_unavailable():
    # Block Redis ports or use circuit breaker to force failures
    pass

# Mock for integration tests
@patch('netra_backend.app.redis_manager.RedisManager.get')
async def mock_redis_failure(*args, **kwargs):
    raise ConnectionError("Redis unavailable")
```

**Monitoring Service Failure:**
```python
async def simulate_monitoring_service_down():
    # Block monitoring endpoints
    # Return 503 for health checks, metrics collection
    pass
```

**Analytics Service Failure:**
```python
async def simulate_analytics_service_failure():
    # Mock ClickHouse unavailability
    # Verify core functionality continues
    pass
```

### Circuit Breaker Integration

**Required Circuit Breaker Configurations:**
- **Redis:** failure_threshold=3, recovery_timeout=30s
- **Monitoring:** failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=60s
- **Analytics:** failure_threshold=2, recovery_timeout=45s

### Performance Requirements During Degradation

**Response Time Requirements:**
- WebSocket event delivery: <2 seconds even with service failures
- Health endpoint: <5 seconds with dependency failures
- Agent execution: <30 seconds with non-critical services down

## 4. Expected Implementation Requirements

## 10. Next Steps

1. **Create Integration Test Files** - Start with test files that initially fail
2. **Validate Test Infrastructure** - Ensure tests can simulate service failures
3. **Staging Environment Setup** - Configure staging for resilience testing
4. **Implementation Planning** - Use test failures to guide implementation priorities
5. **Iterative Development** - Implement features to make tests pass
6. **Production Readiness** - Validate all tests pass before deployment

This test plan ensures that Issue #1192 Service Dependency Integration is addressed comprehensively, with tests that validate graceful degradation patterns and ensure the Golden Path continues operating even when non-critical services are unavailable.
