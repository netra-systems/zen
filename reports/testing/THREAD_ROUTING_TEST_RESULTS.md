#### ❌ Failing Tests (10/72 - 14%)

**test_thread_run_registry_core.py failures:**

1. **test_register_with_invalid_parameters**
   - Issue: Invalid parameters not being rejected properly
   - Impact: Could allow corrupt data into registry

2. **test_mapping_ttl_expiration**
   - Issue: TTL expiration not working as expected
   - Impact: Memory leaks from expired mappings not being cleaned

3. **test_cleanup_old_mappings_manual**
   - Issue: Manual cleanup returning 0 when should cleanup
   - Impact: Unable to manually trigger cleanup

4. **test_thread_to_runs_reverse_mapping**
   - Issue: assertIn method not available (test framework issue)
   - Impact: Test execution error

5. **test_registry_metrics_collection**
   - Issue: Metrics structure missing expected keys
   - Impact: Monitoring capabilities impaired

6. **test_registry_status_information**
   - Issue: Status structure missing expected keys
   - Impact: Health monitoring incomplete

7. **test_registry_error_resilience**
   - Issue: Lock errors not handled gracefully
   - Impact: System instability under error conditions

8. **test_initialize_thread_run_registry**
   - Issue: Configuration not being applied correctly
   - Impact: Registry not using provided configuration

9. **test_registry_shutdown**
   - Issue: Registry already shutdown in test setup
   - Impact: Test isolation issue

10. **test_shutdown_cancels_background_tasks**
    - Issue: Cleanup task already completed
    - Impact: Background task lifecycle issue

## Root Cause Analysis

The failing tests indicate several issues with the ThreadRunRegistry implementation:

1. **Configuration Management**: Registry not properly accepting custom configuration
2. **Lifecycle Management**: Shutdown state and background tasks not managed correctly
3. **TTL and Cleanup**: Expiration and cleanup mechanisms not functioning
4. **Metrics/Status**: Missing required monitoring fields
5. **Error Handling**: Not gracefully handling lock errors

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix ThreadRunRegistry Issues
- Fix configuration initialization
- Implement proper TTL expiration logic
- Add missing metrics and status fields
- Improve error resilience

### Priority 2: Run Integration Tests
- Execute integration tests with real services
- Validate database and Redis integration
- Test WebSocket associations

### Priority 3: Run E2E Staging Tests
- Validate complete thread lifecycle
- Test multi-user isolation
- Verify WebSocket event flow

## Test Coverage by Business Value

✅ **Message Routing Logic**: 100% passing
- Critical for directing messages to correct handlers
- Priority assignment working correctly
- Performance within acceptable limits

✅ **Thread ID Validation**: 100% passing
- Prevents routing failures from invalid IDs
- Security validation (SQL injection prevention) working
- Performance validation successful

⚠️ **Thread-Run Registry**: 41% passing
- Basic operations working
- TTL and cleanup need fixes
- Monitoring capabilities incomplete

## Overall Assessment

**Unit Test Pass Rate: 86%**

While most unit tests are passing, the ThreadRunRegistry component has significant issues that need to be addressed. The message routing and thread ID validation components are fully functional, which covers the core routing logic. The registry issues primarily affect WebSocket event routing fallback scenarios.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Fix ThreadRunRegistry implementation issues
2. **Continue Testing**: Proceed with integration and E2E tests to identify system-level issues
3. **Monitor Production**: The registry issues could impact production WebSocket event delivery
