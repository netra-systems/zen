## ðŸ”’ CLAUDE.md Compliance

âœ… **NO CHEATING ON TESTS** - All tests fail hard when system breaks
âœ… **NO MOCKS for business logic** - Uses real CreditManager instances
âœ… **ABSOLUTE IMPORTS ONLY** - No relative imports used
âœ… **ERROR RAISING** - No try/except masking failures
âœ… **REAL BUSINESS VALUE** - Each test validates actual business logic

## ðŸš€ Key Business-Critical Test Scenarios

### Revenue Protection Tests
- **Credit Balance Accuracy**: Prevents negative balances and calculation errors
- **Transaction Atomicity**: Ensures credits and transactions remain consistent
- **Fraud Prevention**: Tests for negative amounts and suspicious patterns
- **User Isolation**: Validates credits don't leak between users
- **Audit Trail**: Ensures all credit changes are properly tracked

### Multi-User System Validation
- **Cross-User Isolation**: Tests that user credit operations are properly isolated
- **Concurrent Operations**: Simulates multiple users accessing credit system simultaneously
- **Enterprise Scale**: Tests large credit amounts for high-value customers

### Error Prevention
- **Invalid Input Handling**: Tests zero amounts, negative values, invalid user IDs
- **System Stability**: Prevents crashes from extreme amounts or special characters
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures transaction records match credit operations
