# Cypress Test Execution Status Report

## Executive Summary
After 2 iterations of the test-fix-QA cycle, we've identified and resolved critical issues preventing Cypress test execution. However, fundamental infrastructure requirements prevent full test execution in the current environment.

## Issues Fixed
1. **Asyncio Event Loop Conflict** (Iteration 1)
   - Fixed hanging during circuit breaker initialization
   - Implemented proper event loop detection and thread pool execution
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED

2. **Docker Dependency Handling** (Iteration 2)
   - Added Docker availability checks
   - Implemented graceful fallback when Docker unavailable
   - Enhanced error messages with actionable guidance
   - Status: ✅ IMPROVED

## Current Blockers
### Infrastructure Requirements Not Met
- **Docker Desktop**: Not running (required for service containers)
- **Frontend Server**: Not available on port 3003
- **Backend Services**: Not running on expected ports
- **Database/Redis**: Not accessible

### Test Suite Scope
- **Total Test Files**: 113 Cypress E2E test files
- **Categories Covered**: Authentication, WebSocket, critical flows, features
- **Dependencies**: Full service stack integration required

## Recommendation
The Cypress test category cannot be executed without the required infrastructure. The fixes implemented have improved the test runner's resilience and error reporting, but the fundamental requirement for running services remains.

### Next Steps
1. **Start Docker Desktop** and run: `python scripts/dev_launcher.py`
2. **Alternative**: Run services locally without Docker on required ports
3. **Consider**: Creating mock/stub mode for Cypress tests that don't require full services

## Remaining Iterations
Due to the infrastructure blocker, the remaining 98 iterations cannot proceed with actual Cypress test execution and fixing. The test runner will consistently skip Cypress tests with the message:
"Cannot run Cypress tests: Docker Desktop not running and required local services not available"

## Conclusion
The test-fix-QA cycle has successfully improved the test runner's handling of missing dependencies and resolved critical bugs. However, Cypress E2E tests fundamentally require a running service stack which is not available in the current environment.
