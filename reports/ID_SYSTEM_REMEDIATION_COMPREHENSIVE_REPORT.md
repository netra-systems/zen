## Root Cause Analysis: Five Whys Method

### Problem Statement
ID System has inconsistent adoption - 945+ files use `uuid.uuid4()` directly while only ~70 files use UnifiedIDManager, creating validation complexity and SSOT violations.

### Five Whys Analysis

**🎯 Why #1**: Why do we have inconsistent ID generation?
**Answer:** The system evolved organically with two competing approaches:
1. Direct `uuid.uuid4()` calls (legacy pattern, simpler)
2. UnifiedIDManager (newer pattern, more comprehensive)

**🎯 Why #2**: Why wasn't there a coordinated migration to UnifiedIDManager?
**Answer:** The UnifiedIDManager was introduced without deprecating the old pattern or providing migration tooling. Developers continued using the familiar `uuid.uuid4()` approach.

**🎯 Why #3**: Why is validation so complex?
**Answer:** The system must handle both UUID format (`550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`) AND UnifiedIDManager format (`req_websocket_factory_1757361120277_20_f60bab22`). This dual-format requirement creates complex validation logic.

**🎯 Why #4**: Why wasn't the UnifiedIDManager designed to be UUID-compatible from the start?
**Answer:** The UnifiedIDManager was designed for human-readable IDs with embedded metadata (thread IDs, timestamps, prefixes) rather than pure UUID compatibility. This business requirement conflicted with technical simplicity.

**🎯 Why #5**: Why do we need human-readable IDs with embedded metadata?
**Answer:** Multi-user isolation, audit trails, debugging, and collision detection require structured IDs that carry context. Pure UUIDs don't provide this business value, but the implementation created technical debt.

### TRUE ROOT CAUSE
The **fundamental conflict** between:
- **Business Requirements:** Audit trails, collision detection, human-readable debugging, embedded metadata
- **Technical Simplicity:** UUID compatibility, simple validation, minimal complexity

This led to a **partial migration** where both patterns coexist, creating the validation complexity and SSOT violations we see today.
