- `TestWebSocketBridgeThreadSafety` - Main test suite with 5 critical tests

#### **Test Coverage:**

1. **Thread-Safe Singleton Pattern (50+ threads)**
   - Tests `get_websocket_manager()` singleton with 55 concurrent threads
   - Validates single instance creation across all threads
   - Ensures proper singleton pattern compliance

2. **Race Condition Detection**
   - 30 concurrent workers with 20 operations each
   - Shared counter increment testing
   - Memory coherence validation
   - Race condition detection and reporting

3. **Deadlock Prevention**
   - 25 workers with dual emitter operations
   - Lock ordering consistency testing
   - 10-second timeout detection for deadlocks
   - Proper cleanup synchronization

4. **Message Ordering Guarantees**
   - 20 senders with 25 messages each (500 total messages)
   - Sequential message ordering validation  
   - Timestamp ordering verification
   - Connection-level ordering guarantees

5. **Memory Coherence Validation**
   - 30 threads with shared state modifications
   - Cross-thread boundary memory coherence checks
   - Consistency validation for concurrent operations

## Architecture Features

### Thread Safety Infrastructure

**ThreadSafetyMonitor:**
- Real-time violation detection
- Memory coherence failure tracking
- Singleton access pattern monitoring
- Comprehensive violation reporting

**ThreadSafeWebSocketConnection:**
- Thread-safe message storage with `threading.RLock()`
- Atomic sequence number generation
- Message ordering validation
- Performance tracking per connection

**Advanced Monitoring:**
- Race condition detection
- Deadlock prevention validation
- Lock contention monitoring
- Performance metrics collection

### Test Execution Patterns

**Concurrent Execution:**
- Uses `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for true threading
- `asyncio.gather()` for async concurrency
- Mixed threading and async patterns

**Safety Validation:**
- Thread-safe counters and locks
- Memory coherence checks
- Violation recording with timestamps
- Performance impact measurement

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. **50+ Thread Singleton Validation**
```python
# Tests singleton pattern with 55 concurrent threads
# Each thread makes 5 singleton access calls
# Validates single instance across 275 total accesses
def access_singleton_from_thread(thread_id: int):
    instances = []
    for _ in range(5):
        manager = get_websocket_manager()
        instances.append(id(manager))
```

### 2. **Race Condition Stress Testing**
```python
# Shared counter with potential race conditions
with shared_counter.get_lock():
    current = shared_counter.value
    await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(0.001, 0.003))  # Race opportunity
    shared_counter.value = current + 1
```

### 3. **Message Ordering Guarantees**
```python
# Atomic sequence generation
with self.sequence_lock:
    sequence = self.message_sequence
    self.message_sequence += 1
```

### 4. **Deadlock Prevention**
```python
# Timeout detection for deadlocks
worker_results = await asyncio.wait_for(
    asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True),
    timeout=deadlock_timeout
)
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Thread Safety Overhead
- **Connection Creation:** < 0.5s average per connection
