# System Startup Report
Generated: 2025-09-02 20:12:00 PST

## Executive Summary
System startup attempted with critical failures in Docker container initialization. Core infrastructure components (PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse) briefly started but failed to maintain stability. Authentication and backend services consistently failed with exit code 137 (memory/resource issues).

## Startup Sequence Results

### 1. Docker Services Initialization
**Status:** ❌ FAILED

**Attempted Environments:**
- Standard Test Environment: Container startup failures
- Alpine Test Environment: Container startup failures  
- Development Environment: Container startup failures

**Key Issues:**
- Backend container exits with code 137 (killed - likely memory)
- Auth service container exits with codes 1 and 137
- Database services start but cannot maintain connections
- Docker compose path resolution issues in scripts

### 2. Infrastructure Health

#### PostgreSQL
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Container starts successfully
- Health checks pass initially
- Database 'netra_auth' not created
- Port 5433 accessible but no persistent connection

#### Redis  
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Container starts successfully
- Initial health checks pass
- Connection refused on port 6380 after startup
- Container stops unexpectedly

#### ClickHouse
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Container starts successfully
- Health checks report "starting" then healthy
- Service stops with other containers

### 3. Application Services

#### Backend Service
**Status:** ❌ FAILED
- Container creation successful
- Startup fails with exit code 137
- Module import errors: 'netra_backend.app.agents.execution_engines'
- WebSocket manager initialization issues

#### Auth Service
**Status:** ❌ FAILED  
- Container creation successful
- Fails with exit codes 1 and 137
- Dependency on backend service prevents startup
- JWT secret configuration appears correct

#### Frontend Service
**Status:** ⚠️ UNTESTED
- Container created but not started due to dependency failures

### 4. Business Health Check Results

**Overall Score:** 23/100 - CRITICAL

**Chat System (90% of business value):** 20% operational
- ❌ WebSocket Events: Not functioning
- ❌ Agent Execution: Module import failures
- ✅ User Isolation: Architecture validated
- ❌ Message Delivery: No active connections
- ❌ LLM Connectivity: Service unavailable

**Working Components:**
- Configuration system (development environment)
- User isolation architecture
- JWT secret management

### 5. Architecture Compliance

**Overall Compliance:** 0.0%

**Critical Violations:**
- 21,499 total violations identified
- 106 duplicate type definitions
- 2,049 unjustified mocks in tests
- 21 test files with syntax errors

**Areas of Concern:**
- Test file compliance: -3590.3% (massive violations)
- Real system compliance: 86.4% (110 files with issues)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues:
1. **Resource Constraints:** Exit code 137 indicates containers being killed, likely due to memory limits
2. **Module Structure:** Missing or incorrectly structured Python modules preventing imports
3. **Docker Configuration:** Path resolution issues in Docker management scripts
4. **Service Dependencies:** Cascading failures from backend/auth preventing full stack startup

### Secondary Issues:
1. **Test Infrastructure:** Extensive syntax errors and mock violations
2. **Type System:** Significant duplication across TypeScript definitions
3. **WebSocket Integration:** Bridge components not properly initialized

## Immediate Actions Required

### Critical Path to Recovery:

1. **Fix Docker Memory Issues**
   ```bash
   # Increase Docker Desktop memory allocation
   # Settings > Resources > Memory > 8GB minimum
   ```

2. **Repair Module Structure**
   ```bash
   # Verify and fix missing modules
   python -c "from netra_backend.app.agents import execution_engines"
   python -c "from netra_backend.app.services import llm_client"
   ```

3. **Start Services Individually**
   ```bash
   # Start infrastructure first
   docker-compose up -d dev-postgres dev-redis
   
   # Then auth service
   docker-compose up -d dev-auth
   
   # Finally backend
   docker-compose up -d dev-backend
   ```

4. **Validate Core Functionality**
   ```bash
   # Test database connectivity
   python scripts/test_database_connection.py
   
   # Test Redis
   python scripts/test_redis_connection.py
   
   # Test auth service
   curl http://localhost:8081/health
   ```

## Risk Assessment

### Business Impact:
- **CRITICAL:** Chat system non-operational (90% of business value)
- **HIGH:** No customer value can be delivered
- **HIGH:** Development velocity blocked

### Technical Debt:
- **SEVERE:** 21,499 compliance violations
- **HIGH:** Test infrastructure compromised
- **MEDIUM:** Type system duplication

## Recovery Timeline

### Phase 1: Emergency Stabilization (2-4 hours)
- Fix Docker resource allocation
- Repair critical module imports
- Establish basic service connectivity

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (4-8 hours)
- Restore WebSocket event system
- Fix agent execution engine
- Validate chat message flow

### Phase 3: Full Recovery (1-2 days)
- Address compliance violations
- Fix test infrastructure
- Deduplicate type definitions

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Service Health Endpoints**
   - Backend: http://localhost:8000/health
   - Auth: http://localhost:8081/health
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000/api/health

2. **Container Monitoring**
   ```bash
   docker stats --no-stream
   docker logs -f netra-core-generation-1-dev-backend-1
   ```

3. **Resource Usage**
   ```bash
   docker system df
   docker system events
   ```

## Conclusion

The system is currently in a critical non-operational state with fundamental infrastructure and application failures. Immediate intervention is required to restore basic functionality. The primary focus should be on resolving Docker resource constraints and fixing module import issues to enable the chat system, which represents 90% of business value.

**Recommendation:** Allocate dedicated engineering resources immediately to execute the recovery plan, starting with Docker memory configuration and module structure repairs.
