# LIFE OR DEATH CRITICAL: Chat is King WebSocket Agent Prompts

## ðŸ”´ PROMPT 1: Critical Infrastructure Fixes

**LIFE OR DEATH CRITICAL: ACTION:**
BATCH 1: Critical Infrastructure Fixes from CHAT_IS_KING_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md

FOR EACH sub task in item:
1) Don't believe the report fully - check latest system and think about it yourself
2) Use multi-agent (3-7 best most relevant agents) to complete actual work
3) Failing tests and test suite must be complete, comprehensive, and difficult

### CRITICAL MISSION:
Fix the fixture scope architecture crisis that's blocking ALL WebSocket tests. The session-scoped `real_services_manager` is causing 175+ test failures.

### SUB-TASKS TO COMPLETE:
1. **Fixture Scope Architecture Emergency Fix**
   - Investigate `tests/mission_critical/conftest.py` line 48-56
   - Verify the actual error: session scope accessing function scope
   - Create compatibility wrapper OR refactor to function scope
   - Test with at least 10 different test files to ensure fix works
   - DO NOT trust that changing scope is simple - check all dependencies

2. **Missing Test Framework Module Creation**
   - Search entire codebase for `TestContext` references
   - Determine what TestContext SHOULD do based on usage patterns
   - Create `test_framework/test_context.py` with WebSocket utilities
   - Include context isolation, user simulation, event tracking
   - Write 5+ unit tests for TestContext itself

3. **Syntax Error Elimination**
   - Fix `test_websocket_simple.py` line 41 continuation character
   - Scan ALL test files for similar syntax issues
   - Create pre-commit hook to prevent future syntax errors
   - Validate with Python AST parser

### AGENTS TO SPAWN:
- **Test Infrastructure Agent**: Fix pytest fixtures and scopes
- **Module Recovery Agent**: Reconstruct missing test_framework
- **Syntax Validation Agent**: Fix and prevent syntax errors
- **Integration Testing Agent**: Validate fixes across suite
- **Dependency Analysis Agent**: Map all fixture dependencies

### VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Run 50+ tests successfully with new fixture architecture
- All imports must resolve without errors
- Zero syntax errors in entire test suite
- Create regression test to prevent scope mismatch

## EXECUTION COORDINATION

### CRITICAL RULES FOR ALL AGENTS:
1. **NEVER trust existing code** - Verify everything yourself
2. **ALWAYS write comprehensive tests** - Minimum 10 tests per feature
3. **COORDINATE with other agents** - Share discoveries via reports
4. **DOCUMENT all changes** - Update SPEC files and learnings
5. **VALIDATE with real services** - NO MOCKS ALLOWED

### PARALLEL EXECUTION STRATEGY:
- **Hour 1-2**: PROMPT 1 (Infrastructure) - MUST complete first
- **Hour 3-5**: PROMPTS 2 & 3 in parallel (WebSocket + Chat)
- **Hour 6-7**: PROMPTS 4 & 5 in parallel (Journey + Performance)
- **Hour 8**: Final integration and validation

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:
âœ… ALL 5 WebSocket events working
âœ… 200+ tests passing
âœ… 10+ concurrent users supported
âœ… < 100ms message latency
âœ… Zero message drops
âœ… Complete user journeys functional
âœ… System stable under load

### FAILURE CONTINGENCY:
If any batch fails:
1. Stop all parallel work
2. Focus all agents on failed batch
3. Create detailed failure analysis
4. Implement workaround if blocker found
5. Document in SPEC/learnings
