## Detailed Test Metrics

### Test Category Breakdown

| Category | Test Files | Test Count | Success Rate | Priority Level | Business Impact |
|----------|------------|------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Backend Unit Tests** | 1,738 | 11,325 | >99% | HIGH | Core component validation |
| **Mission Critical** | 14+ | 169 | 100% | CRITICAL | $500K+ ARR protection |
| **Integration Tests** | 757+ | 757 | >99% | MEDIUM | Service integration |
| **E2E Tests** | 1,570+ | 1,570 | >99% | LOW-MEDIUM | User journey validation |
| **Auth Service** | 163 | 800+ | >99% | HIGH | Security and authentication |
| **Golden Path** | Multiple | 50+ | 100% | CRITICAL | Core user flow |
| **WebSocket** | Multiple | 100+ | >99% | MEDIUM | Real-time communication |
| **Agent Tests** | Multiple | 200+ | >99% | MEDIUM | AI agent functionality |

### Test Collection Statistics

#### Overall Collection Health
- **Total Test Files:** 10,971+ files
- **Total Tests Discovered:** 14,621+ individual tests
- **Collection Errors:** <10 errors (>99.9% success rate)
- **Discovery Methodology:** Direct pytest collection with continue-on-errors

#### Collection Error Analysis
The few remaining collection errors (<10) are primarily due to:
1. Missing optional dependencies (non-critical modules)
2. Legacy test fixtures that need updating
3. Import path adjustments for refactored modules

All collection errors are **non-blocking** and do not affect core functionality testing.

### Test Execution Patterns

#### Mission Critical Test Execution
```bash
# Core business protection (MUST PASS for deployment)
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category mission_critical

# Specific critical test suites
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py
python tests/mission_critical/test_no_ssot_violations.py
```

#### Development Workflow Testing
```bash
# Fast feedback loop
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category unit --fast-fail

# Real services integration
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category integration --real-services

# Complete validation
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --categories smoke unit integration api
```
