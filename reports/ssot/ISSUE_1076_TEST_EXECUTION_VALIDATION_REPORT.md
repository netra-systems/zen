# Issue #1076 SSOT Violation Test Execution Validation Report

**Date:** 2025-09-16
**Status:** ‚úÖ TESTS VALIDATED - Working correctly and detecting violations
**Scope:** Complete test strategy validation for 3,845 SSOT violations
**Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality protection

## Executive Summary

Successfully executed and validated the SSOT violation test plan for Issue #1076. The tests are **WORKING CORRECTLY** - they are failing as designed to detect the existing 3,845 SSOT violations across critical system components. This validates that our test strategy is sound and ready to proceed with systematic remediation.

**Key Validation:** Tests are failing because violations exist, NOT because tests are broken.
