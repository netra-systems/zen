# Test Iteration 3 - After Deployment - 2025-09-07 10:45:00

## Summary of Test Results

### Priority 1 Critical Tests (After Deployment)
- **Total**: 25 tests
- **Passed**: 22 (88%)
- **Failed**: 3 (12%)
- **Execution Time**: 38.54 seconds

### Change from Iteration 2
- **Previous Pass Rate**: 96% (24/25 passed)
- **Current Pass Rate**: 88% (22/25 passed)
- **Regression**: 3 more tests failing after deployment

### Failed Tests Analysis

#### WebSocket Connection Tests (3 failures)
1. **test_001_websocket_connection_real**: HTTP 500 error
   - Token creation successful (hash: 70610b56526d0480)
   - Without token: Correctly returns HTTP 403
   - With token: Server error HTTP 500
   
2. **test_002_websocket_authentication_real**: HTTP 500 error
   - Same pattern as test_001
   
3. **test_003_websocket_message_send_real**: Connection failure
   - Unable to establish WebSocket connection

### Working Components (22/25 tests passing)
- ✅ Agent discovery and configuration
- ✅ Agent execution endpoints
- ✅ Tool execution
- ✅ Message persistence
- ✅ Thread management
- ✅ User context isolation
- ✅ Concurrent users support
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Connection resilience
- ✅ Session persistence
- ✅ Agent lifecycle management
- ✅ Streaming results
- ✅ Message ordering
- ✅ Event delivery

### Root Cause Analysis

#### WebSocket Server Issue (HTTP 500)
The WebSocket endpoint is experiencing internal server errors despite successful JWT authentication:

1. **Authentication is Working**: 
   - HTTP 403 returned when no token provided (correct)
   - JWT tokens are being created with correct staging secret
   - Secret hash matches: 70610b56526d0480

2. **Server Internal Error**:
   - HTTP 500 indicates server-side failure after auth
   - Likely causes:
     - WebSocket handler initialization failure
     - Missing dependencies (Redis/DB connections)
     - Resource constraints
     - Configuration issues

### Next Steps

1. **Check GCP Logs for HTTP 500 errors**
2. **Verify WebSocket service health**
3. **Check Redis and database connectivity**
4. **Review WebSocket handler code for issues**

### Test Commands Used
```bash
python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_priority1_critical.py -v --tb=short
```

## Deployment Status
- Deployment completed successfully
- Services are running
- REST API endpoints working
- WebSocket endpoint failing with internal errors

## Summary
While the deployment succeeded and most services are working (88% pass rate), the WebSocket functionality remains broken with HTTP 500 errors. The authentication fix is confirmed working (no more 403 errors), but the server has internal issues preventing WebSocket connections.
