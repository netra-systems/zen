# Staging Test Loop - Iteration 2
**Date**: 2025-09-07
**Time**: 05:44:00 AM

## Test Run Summary

### Current Test Status
- **P1 Critical Tests (Priority)**: 25/25 passed ✅
- **Real Agent Pipeline Tests**: 0/6 passed ❌

### Key Failures Identified

#### 1. Import Error - WebSocketAuthTester
**Location**: `test_framework.helpers.auth_helpers`
**Error**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'WebSocketAuthTester' from 'test_framework.helpers.auth_helpers'`
**Affected Tests**: All 6 tests in `test_real_agent_pipeline.py`

### Root Cause Analysis
The `WebSocketAuthTester` class appears to be missing from the auth_helpers module. This is preventing all real agent pipeline tests from running.

### Files Affected
- `tests/e2e/agent_conversation_helpers.py` (line 133)
- `test_framework/helpers/auth_helpers.py` (missing WebSocketAuthTester)

## Action Plan
1. Fix the WebSocketAuthTester import issue
2. Re-run the failed tests
3. Continue with comprehensive staging test suite

## Five Whys Analysis
1. **Why are tests failing?** - ImportError for WebSocketAuthTester
2. **Why is WebSocketAuthTester not importable?** - It's missing from auth_helpers.py
3. **Why is it missing?** - Likely a refactoring or incomplete implementation
4. **Why was it not caught earlier?** - Tests may not have been run recently
5. **Why weren't tests run?** - Focus may have been on other priorities

## Next Steps
Spawning multi-agent team to fix the WebSocketAuthTester import issue...
