## Conclusion

The singleton removal effort has made significant progress in understanding and designing solutions for critical user isolation issues in the Netra platform. However, **the implementation phase is incomplete and the system is not ready for production deployment with concurrent users.**

### Key Achievements:
- Comprehensive analysis of singleton patterns and risks
- Detailed factory pattern architecture designs
- Extensive test suite for validation
- Clear understanding of business impact and requirements

### Critical Work Remaining:
- Complete ExecutionEngine factory implementation
- Restore WebSocket event delivery functionality
- Implement WebSocket bridge factory pattern
- Validate all concurrent user scenarios

### Business Impact:
This work is **critical for enterprise scalability** and **user data security**. The current singleton patterns create unacceptable risks for data leakage and system instability under concurrent load. Completing this migration is essential before the platform can safely support multiple simultaneous users.

### Timeline to Production Readiness:
**Estimated 2-3 weeks** to complete implementation and validation, assuming dedicated focus on P0 work items.

### Recommendation:
**Continue development** - the architectural foundation is solid, the problems are well-understood, and the solutions are clearly defined. Complete the implementation phase with high priority to enable safe concurrent user support.
