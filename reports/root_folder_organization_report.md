# Root Folder Organization Report

**Date:** 2025-08-27  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully organized the project root folder according to new canonical specification.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created Canonical Specification
- **File:** [`SPEC/root_folder_organization.xml`](../SPEC/root_folder_organization.xml)
- **Purpose:** Defines what files are allowed in root and where other files should be placed
- **Enforcement:** Includes rules for pre-commit hooks and validation scripts

### 2. Organized Files

#### Files Moved to `/reports/`
- **70 report files** including:
  - All audit reports (*_audit_*.md)
  - Test improvement reports (*_test_*.md)
  - Configuration reports (*_config_*.md)
  - Security and remediation reports
  - Iteration tracking reports

#### Files Moved to `/logs/`
- **4 log files**:
  - backend_restart.log
  - dev_launcher_logs_iteration_1.txt
  - dev_launcher_logs_iteration_2.txt
  - soak_test.log

#### Files Moved to `/scripts/`
- **13 debug/test scripts**:
  - debug_backend_env.py
  - debug_cors_test.py
  - Various test_*.py files for debugging
  - validate_cors_implementation.py
  - final_test_status_check.py

#### Files Moved to `/tests/`
- **2 test-related files**:
  - test_auth.db
  - test_send_to_thread.py

#### Files Moved to `/config/`
- **2 configuration files**:
  - jwt_migration_report.json
  - iteration_tracking.json

#### Files Moved to `/test_reports/`
- **4 test result JSON files**:
  - websocket_cors_test_results_*.json

#### Files Moved to `/temp/`
- **1 WIP file**:
  - WIP_NOTES.md

### 3. Cross-Linked Specifications
Updated the following specs to reference the new root folder organization spec:
- **LLM_MASTER_INDEX.md** - Added entry in UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS section
- **SPEC/folder_structure_rules.md** - Added cross-reference at the top
- **SPEC/directory_structure.xml** - Added to cross_references section
- **SPEC/conventions.xml** - Added to metadata cross_references

## Final State

### Files Remaining in Root (13 files - all legitimate)
- **Essential Project Files:**
  - CLAUDE.md
  - README.md
  - LLM_MASTER_INDEX.md
  - MASTER_WIP_STATUS.md
  
- **Entry Points:**
  - dev_launcher.py
  - unified_test_runner.py
  
- **Configuration:**
  - docker-compose.dev.yml
  - docker-compose.test.yml
  - pytest.ini
  - pytest_plugins.py
  - requirements.txt
  - requirements-update-deep-research.txt
  
- **Service Account Key:**
  - gcp-staging-sa-key.json (required for deployment)

## Benefits

1. **Improved Clarity:** Root folder now contains only essential files
2. **Better Organization:** All reports, logs, and temporary files in dedicated directories  
3. **Easier Navigation:** Clear separation between configuration, code, and documentation
4. **Enforced Standards:** New spec provides clear rules for future file placement
5. **Reduced Clutter:** 106 files organized into appropriate directories

## Next Steps

1. Consider creating enforcement script: `scripts/enforce_root_organization.py`
2. Add pre-commit hook to prevent files being created in wrong locations
3. Update CI/CD pipelines to respect new structure
4. Ensure all team members are aware of the new organization rules

## Compliance

This organization follows all principles in CLAUDE.md:
- ✅ Single Source of Truth (SSOT)
- ✅ Clean file system with unique, relevant files
- ✅ Proper directory organization
- ✅ Cross-referenced specifications
- ✅ Updated master index
