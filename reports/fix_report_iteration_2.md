# Docker Availability Fix Report - Iteration 2

## Problem Analysis

The unified test runner cannot run Cypress tests because it tries to start Docker services but Docker Desktop is not running. This causes the test execution to hang indefinitely.

## Root Cause Investigation

### Why Docker is Required for Cypress Tests

1. **Service Dependencies**: Cypress E2E tests require these services:
   - Backend API (port 8000)
   - Frontend dev server (port 3000) 
   - PostgreSQL database (port 5432)
   - Redis cache (port 6379)

2. **Docker Fallback**: When local services aren't available, the system attempts to start Docker containers as fallbacks for:
   - PostgreSQL (`netra-dev-postgres` container on port 5433)
   - Redis (`netra-dev-redis` container on port 6379)

3. **Hanging Issue**: The `ServiceDependencyManager` calls Docker commands that hang when Docker Desktop is not running, causing the entire test execution to freeze.

## What Services Need Docker

Docker is used as a fallback for:
- **PostgreSQL Database**: When no local PostgreSQL instance is running
- **Redis Cache**: When no local Redis instance is running

These services have `"docker_fallback": True` in their configuration.

## Attempted Fix (Partial Implementation)

I implemented a basic Docker availability check in the service manager:

### Changes Made

1. **Enhanced `ServiceDependencyManager`** (`test_framework/cypress/service_manager.py`):
   - Added `check_docker_availability()` import
   - Added `self.docker_available` check during initialization
   - Skip Docker operations when Docker is unavailable
   - Added `get_docker_status_info()` method for better error reporting

2. **Enhanced `CypressTestRunner`** (`test_framework/cypress_runner.py`):
   - Improved error messages when services fail
   - Added Docker status information in error responses
   - Added helpful suggestions for when Docker is unavailable

3. **Enhanced Unified Test Runner** (`scripts/unified_test_runner.py`):
   - Better error handling for Docker-related failures
   - Added hints about Docker Desktop and local services

### Why This Fix is Incomplete

The current implementation still hangs because:

1. **Async Service Initialization**: The service manager still tries to check service health in async loops that may hang on Docker commands
2. **Deep Integration**: Docker checks are embedded throughout the service discovery process
3. **Timeout Handling**: The async service readiness checks don't properly handle Docker unavailability timeouts

## Recommended Complete Solution

### Immediate Fix (Minimal Changes)

1. **Add Early Docker Check**: Check Docker availability at the very start of test execution
2. **Skip Cypress Category**: When Docker is unavailable and no local services detected, skip Cypress tests with informative message
3. **Service Validation**: Add quick service availability checks before attempting full service startup

### Long-term Solution (Team Support Required)

1. **Service Abstraction**: Create a service availability interface that doesn't depend on Docker
2. **Mock Mode**: Implement a "mock service" mode for E2E tests when real services unavailable
3. **Configuration Override**: Allow users to specify which services to skip or mock
4. **Docker-Free Testing**: Develop E2E tests that can run without database/cache dependencies

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
```python
# In unified_test_runner.py, add early check:
def _can_run_cypress_tests(self) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """Check if Cypress tests can run given current environment."""
    from dev_launcher.docker_services import check_docker_availability
    
    # Check Docker availability
    docker_available = check_docker_availability()
    
    # Check local services (quick checks, no hanging)
    local_postgres = self._quick_service_check("localhost", 5432)
    local_redis = self._quick_service_check("localhost", 6379)
    
    if not docker_available and not (local_postgres and local_redis):
        return False, (
            "Cannot run Cypress tests: Docker Desktop not running and "
            "required local services not available. "
            "Either start Docker Desktop or run local PostgreSQL (port 5432) "
            "and Redis (port 6379) services."
        )
    
    return True, "Services available"
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Architecture (Future)
- Service discovery refactoring
- Better async timeout handling
- Mock service implementations
- Configuration-driven service requirements

## Files Affected

- `test_framework/cypress/service_manager.py` - ✓ Partially fixed
- `test_framework/cypress_runner.py` - ✓ Partially fixed  
- `scripts/unified_test_runner.py` - ✓ Partially fixed
- Additional files needed for complete fix

## Updated Analysis - Deeper Issue Found

After further investigation, the problem is more fundamental than initially thought. The unified test runner hangs during **initialization**, not just during Cypress test execution.

### Root Cause Identified

The hanging occurs during the initialization of circuit breakers in the test framework, as evidenced by the logs:
```
Created unified circuit breaker: database_retry_circuit
Created unified circuit breaker: llm_retry_circuit  
Created unified circuit breaker: api_retry_circuit
Created unified circuit breaker: auth_service_retry_circuit
Created unified circuit breaker: netra_backend_retry_circuit
Created unified circuit breaker: dev_launcher_retry_circuit
```

The system hangs after creating circuit breakers, suggesting that some component in the test framework initialization is trying to connect to Docker or services during startup.

### Attempted Fixes Applied

1. **Docker Availability Check**: ✅ Added to `ServiceDependencyManager`
2. **Lazy Loading**: ✅ Made `CypressTestRunner` load only when needed  
3. **Early Service Check**: ✅ Added quick socket-based service availability check
4. **Enhanced Error Messages**: ✅ Better Docker-related error reporting

### Current Status

Despite implementing the fixes, **all test categories hang during initialization**, not just Cypress tests. This indicates the issue is in the core test framework initialization process.

## Conclusion

This issue requires **team coordination** to resolve because:

1. **Deep Integration**: The hanging occurs in core test framework components during initialization
2. **Circuit Breaker Dependencies**: The circuit breakers may be trying to establish connections during startup
3. **Service Discovery**: The test framework appears to have service dependencies baked into its initialization

**Status**: Partial improvements implemented, but core hanging issue requires architectural changes to test framework initialization. The Docker availability checks and error messages are ready, but won't be effective until the initialization hanging is resolved.

**Recommendation**: Skip Cypress tests entirely until the test framework initialization can be made Docker-independent, or run tests in an environment where Docker Desktop is available.
