## ✅ Step 3 Complete: SSOT Remediation Strategy Planned

**STATUS:** Step 3 planning completed successfully - comprehensive remediation strategy ready

### 🎯 Planning Deliverables Achieved

**7 Critical Planning Components Completed:**
1. ✅ **Import Migration Plan**: Strategy to consolidate 15+ fragmented import paths to single SSOT path
2. ✅ **Factory Pattern Consolidation**: Plan to eliminate competing factory implementations
3. ✅ **Race Condition Fixes**: Technical solutions for concurrent initialization issues
4. ✅ **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive risk analysis with mitigation strategies
5. ✅ **Testing Strategy**: Validation approach to ensure Step 2 tests PASS
6. ✅ **Implementation Sequence**: 4-phase approach with clear timeline
7. ✅ **Success Criteria**: Defined metrics for successful remediation

### 🏗️ 4-Phase Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Import Path Consolidation** (2 hours, Low risk)
- Consolidate 15+ import paths to single canonical SSOT path
- Update all WebSocket Manager imports across codebase
- Validate import consistency

**Phase 2: Factory Pattern Consolidation** (1 hour, Low-Medium risk)
- Eliminate competing factory implementations
- Consolidate to single `get_websocket_manager()` function
- Update factory usage patterns

**Phase 3: Race Condition Fixes** (2-3 hours, Medium risk)
- Implement concurrent initialization safeguards
- Fix connection management race conditions
- Resolve event delivery ordering issues

**Phase 4: Final Integration and Validation** (1 hour, Low risk)
- Complete integration testing
- Validate all success criteria met
- Confirm Golden Path functionality

### 📊 Success Criteria Defined

Implementation will be successful when:
- ✅ All 16 Step 2 test methods change from FAIL → PASS
- ✅ All 42+ mission critical tests continue to PASS
- ✅ Golden Path user flow (login → AI responses) maintained
- ✅ No race conditions detected in concurrent scenarios
- ✅ WebSocket events delivered in correct order

### 💼 Business Value Protection

- **$500K+ ARR Protected**: Mission critical functionality maintained
- **Golden Path Secured**: Core user experience preserved
- **Risk Mitigated**: Comprehensive risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- **Test-Driven Safety**: All changes validated by comprehensive test suite

### ➡️ Next Steps

Ready for **Step 4: Execute SSOT Remediation Plan**

Total implementation time: 4-6 hours with systematic validation at each phase.
