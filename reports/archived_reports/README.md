### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex.git
cd netra-apex

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables (check docs for current env setup)
# See docs/STAGING_DEMO_SETUP.md for complete environment configuration

# Start the application (Staging recommended for validation)
# Option 1: Quick demo setup
python scripts/staging_demo_setup.py --frontend gcp

# Option 2: Docker development (local)
docker-compose up

# Option 3: Individual services
python scripts/launch_backend.py
python scripts/launch_auth_service.py
npm --prefix frontend run dev
```

### 🚀 Quick Demo Launch

For a quick staging demo with automatic setup:

```bash
# Using Claude Code command (recommended)
/run-demo

# Or using the Python script directly
python scripts/staging_demo_setup.py --frontend gcp  # Use GCP frontend
python scripts/staging_demo_setup.py --frontend localhost  # Use local frontend
```

This command handles all setup including:
- GCP authentication
- Environment configuration

## 🏛️ System Architecture

The system follows a multi-tier architecture with complete user isolation:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Frontend UI   │
├─────────────────┤
│   API Gateway   │
├─────────────────┤
│ Factory Layer   │ ← Creates isolated instances per request
├─────────────────┤
│ Execution Layer │ ← User-specific execution contexts
├─────────────────┤
│ Infrastructure  │ ← Shared, immutable resources
└─────────────────┘
```

For detailed architecture diagrams and explanations, see **[User Context Architecture](./reports/archived/USER_CONTEXT_ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## 🔒 Security

The system implements multiple security boundaries:

1. **Request Isolation** - Each request gets its own execution context
2. **User Isolation** - Complete separation between concurrent users
3. **Resource Limits** - Per-user semaphores and memory limits
4. **Permission Layers** - Tool execution permission checking
5. **Secure Cleanup** - Automatic resource cleanup on request completion
