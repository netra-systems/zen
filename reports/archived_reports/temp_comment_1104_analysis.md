## üîç Five Whys Root Cause Analysis - WebSocket Manager Import Failure

### Root Cause Identified

**WHY 1:** Import fails because `UnifiedWebSocketManager` is not exported from `unified_manager.py`
- **Evidence:** `__all__ = ['WebSocketConnection', '_serialize_message_safely', 'WebSocketManagerMode']`

**WHY 2:** Export was intentionally removed during SSOT consolidation (Issue #824)
- **Evidence:** File comments: "UnifiedWebSocketManager export removed - use WebSocketManager from websocket_manager.py"

**WHY 3:** SSOT consolidation completed but import statements in tests were not updated
- **Evidence:** Correct import available: `from netra_backend.app.websocket_core.websocket_manager import UnifiedWebSocketManager`

**WHY 4:** No automated import validation during SSOT migration process
- **Evidence:** Mission critical tests were not run during consolidation to catch breaking changes

**WHY 5:** Architectural migration lacks systematic validation process ensuring business continuity
- **Root Cause:** SSOT improvements prioritized code organization over maintaining test suite functionality

### Solution Identified

**Correct Import Path (WORKING):**
```python
from netra_backend.app.websocket_core.websocket_manager import UnifiedWebSocketManager
```

**Files Requiring Update:**
1. `tests/mission_critical/test_basic_triage_response_revenue_protection.py`
2. `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`
3. All other files using old import path: `netra_backend.app.websocket_core.unified_manager`

### Systemic Issue

This is part of a broader pattern where SSOT consolidation (Issue #824) removed exports without ensuring dependent code was updated. The websocket_manager.py file correctly exports the class, but old import paths were not systematically updated.

**Next Action:** Update all import statements to use canonical SSOT path and validate mission critical tests pass.
