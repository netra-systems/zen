**Pattern Analysis:**
```python
# VIOLATION PATTERN (284 instances):
mock_agent = Mock()
mock_agent = AsyncMock()
mock_agent = MagicMock()

# CORRECT SSOT PATTERN:
from test_framework.ssot.mock_factory import SSotMockFactory
mock_agent = SSotMockFactory.create_agent_mock(agent_type='supervisor')
```

**Pattern Analysis:**
```python
# VIOLATION PATTERN (1,073 instances):  
mock_websocket = MagicMock()
mock_websocket.send_text = AsyncMock()
mock_websocket.send_json = AsyncMock()

# CORRECT SSOT PATTERN:
mock_websocket = SSotMockFactory.create_websocket_mock(
    connection_id="test-conn",
    user_id="test-user"
)
```

### 2.3 Database Mock Violations (582 Total)

**Critical Areas:**

# VIOLATION PATTERN (582 instances):
mock_session = AsyncMock()
mock_session.execute = AsyncMock()
mock_session.commit = AsyncMock()

# CORRECT SSOT PATTERN:
mock_session = SSotMockFactory.create_database_session_mock()
```

## Section 3: Test Gap Analysis

### 3.1 Golden Path Protection Gaps

**CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED:**

1. **Mock Integration Consistency Testing** - MISSING
   - Need tests validating SSOT mocks integrate properly with real components
   - Gap: No validation that SSOT mocks maintain interface consistency

2. **Mock Factory Performance Testing** - MISSING
   - Need tests ensuring SSOT mock creation doesn't impact test performance
   - Gap: No baseline performance metrics for mock creation

3. **Mock Factory Multi-User Isolation Testing** - MISSING
   - Need tests validating mock factories preserve user isolation
   - Gap: Critical for multi-tenant system testing

4. **Mock Factory Regression Prevention Testing** - MISSING
