# SSOT JWT Token Handling Duplication - Issue #1078

**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/1078  
**Created:** 2025-09-14  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Priority:** P1 (High) - Security Risk + Golden Path Blocker

## Problem Summary

JWT token handling is duplicated between auth service and backend, violating SSOT principles and creating security risks.

**SSOT Source:** `/auth_service/auth_core/core/jwt_handler.py`  
**Violations:**
- `/netra_backend/app/clients/auth_client_core.py` - Contains `_decode_test_jwt()` and `_decode_token()` methods
- `/netra_backend/app/auth_integration/auth.py` - Should only delegate to auth service
- Direct `jwt.decode()` calls in backend production code

## Business Impact
- **Security Risk:** Inconsistent token validation across services
- **Golden Path Blocker:** User authentication prerequisite for chat functionality 
- **Revenue Risk:** $500K+ ARR chat functionality depends on reliable auth
- **Maintenance Complexity:** Duplicate auth logic across services

## Work Progress

### Step 0: SSOT Audit âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Identified JWT duplication as #1 priority SSOT violation
- [x] Created GitHub issue #1078
- [x] Created progress tracking file

### Step 1: Discover and Plan Tests ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- [x] 1.1: Discover existing auth tests protecting JWT functionality âœ… COMPLETED
  - Found 300+ JWT/auth test files across all services
  - Identified 25+ CRITICAL tests that will break without updates
  - 50+ HIGH RISK tests requiring significant changes
  - Mission critical Golden Path tests already SSOT-compatible
- [x] 1.2: Plan test updates/creation for SSOT refactor âœ… COMPLETED
  - Planned 25+ critical test updates for JWT â†’ auth service delegation
  - Designed new SSOT compliance detection tests (20% of work)
  - Created comprehensive validation strategy for Golden Path protection

### Step 2: Execute Test Plan âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create new SSOT-specific tests (~20% of work) âœ… COMPLETED
  - Created 4 comprehensive test files with 19 tests total
  - Tests detect 39 current JWT violations in the system
  - Golden Path protection tests safeguard $500K+ ARR functionality
  - Tests fail before SSOT refactor, will pass after (validation working)
- [x] Run non-docker tests (unit, integration, e2e staging) âœ… COMPLETED
  - All tests executed successfully in non-Docker environment
  - Test results validate violation detection is working correctly

### Step 3: Plan SSOT Remediation ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Plan removal of duplicate JWT logic from backend ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Plan auth service delegation pattern

### Step 4: Execute Remediation ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- [ ] Remove JWT decode methods from backend
- [ ] Update all JWT operations to use auth service
- [ ] Update imports and dependencies

### Step 5: Test Fix Loop ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- [ ] Run all existing tests and ensure they pass
- [ ] Fix any breaking changes
- [ ] Validate system stability

### Step 6: PR and Closure ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Link to issue #1078 for auto-closure

## Files to Modify
- `/netra_backend/app/clients/auth_client_core.py` (remove JWT methods)
- `/netra_backend/app/auth_integration/auth.py` (ensure delegation only)
- All files importing duplicate JWT functionality
- Tests using direct JWT decode in production paths

## Commit History
- Initial issue creation and progress tracking setup

## Notes
- Must maintain Golden Path functionality throughout refactor
- All JWT operations should delegate to auth service SSOT
- Security implications require careful testing
