# SSOT ExecutionEngine Fragmentation - Issue #874

**GitHub Issue**: https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/874
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL (Golden Path Blocking)
**Business Impact**: $500K+ ARR at risk - Users cannot reliably get AI responses

## Problem Summary
ExecutionEngine SSOT fragmentation with 15+ implementations causing race conditions and user isolation failures, directly blocking Golden Path user flow.

## Progress Tracking

### âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **STEP 0**: SSOT Audit completed - Critical violation identified
- [x] **GitHub Issue**: Created issue #874 with P0 priority
- [x] **Progress Tracker**: Created this tracking document

### ðŸ”„ CURRENT STATUS
**ACTIVE STEP**: 1) DISCOVER AND PLAN TEST

### ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS
- [ ] **STEP 1**: Discover existing tests protecting ExecutionEngine functionality
- [ ] **STEP 2**: Execute test plan for new SSOT validation tests
- [ ] **STEP 3**: Plan SSOT remediation strategy
- [ ] **STEP 4**: Execute ExecutionEngine consolidation
- [ ] **STEP 5**: Test fix loop until all tests pass
- [ ] **STEP 6**: Create PR and close issue

## Critical Files Identified
- `/netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/execution_engine.py` (legacy - needs deprecation)
- `/netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/user_execution_engine.py` (SSOT target)
- `/netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/execution_factory.py` (needs consolidation)
- Multiple factory/adapter files creating confusion

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Single ExecutionEngine SSOT implementation
- [ ] All agent execution routes through consolidated pattern
- [ ] User isolation validated via tests
- [ ] Golden Path user flow restored: login â†’ AI responses

## Business Justification
- **Segment**: Enterprise + All tiers
- **Goal**: Platform stability + Customer retention
- **Value Impact**: Restore 90% of platform value (chat functionality)
- **Revenue Impact**: Protect $500K+ ARR from execution reliability issues
