## üîÑ ISSUE REGRESSION CONFIRMED (2025-09-13 Latest Test Session)

**STATUS UPDATE:** Despite previous claims of resolution, **Issue #860 WebSocket connection failures PERSIST** with identical symptoms.

### Current Test Execution Results

**Command Executed:** `python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`

**Results:** **1 FAILED, 2 ERROR, 3 PASSED** out of 39 collected tests (identical pattern)

**Error Pattern:** **EXACT MATCH** with original issue description:
```
ConnectionError: Failed to create WebSocket connection after 3 attempts:
[WinError 1225] The remote computer refused the network connection
```

### Failed Tests (Current Session)
- ‚ùå **TestRealWebSocketComponents::test_real_websocket_connection_established** (FAILED)
- ‚ùå **TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_agent_started_event_structure** (ERROR)
- ‚ùå **TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_agent_thinking_event_structure** (ERROR)

### Environment Details (Current Session)
- **Platform:** Windows (win32)
- **Python:** 3.13.7
- **pytest:** 8.4.2
- **WebSocket URL:** ws://localhost:8000/ws/test (connection refused)
- **Docker Status:** Unavailable (consistent with Issue #420 strategic resolution)

### Analysis of Previous Resolution Claims

The comment from 2025-09-13 claiming **'Phase 1 REMEDIATION COMPLETE - WinError 1225 RESOLVED'** appears to be either:
1. **Not fully implemented** in the codebase
2. **Reverted** by subsequent changes
3. **Incomplete** - only partially resolved

**Evidence of Regression:**
- Mock WebSocket server on port 8001 not functioning
- Environment detection not working as designed
- Windows Docker bypass not operating correctly

### Business Impact (Ongoing)

üö® **CRITICAL BUSINESS FUNCTIONALITY BLOCKED:**
- **$500K+ ARR** chat functionality testing cannot be validated locally
- **Mission critical** WebSocket agent events validation failing
- **Golden Path** user flow testing blocked on Windows platform
- **Developer workflow** compromised for Windows-based development

### Root Cause Analysis Update

**WHY #1:** Why is the issue persisting despite claimed resolution?
‚Üí Previous remediation either incomplete, not committed, or regressed

**WHY #2:** Why did mock WebSocket server approach fail?
‚Üí Implementation not active in current test execution environment

**WHY #3:** Why wasn't staging environment fallback working?
‚Üí Local tests not configured to use staging environment properly

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Verify Resolution Implementation:** Check if claimed fixes are actually in the codebase
2. **Test Environment Audit:** Ensure environment detection and mock server are operational
3. **Staging Fallback Validation:** Implement reliable staging environment connectivity for Windows
4. **Regression Prevention:** Add validation to prevent future regressions of this fix

### Priority Escalation

Given the **business impact** and **persistent nature** of this P0 issue despite multiple resolution attempts:

**Request:** Assign dedicated engineering resources to resolve this persistent Windows WebSocket connectivity issue definitively.

**Timeline:** This issue requires **immediate resolution** to restore Windows developer productivity and mission critical test validation.
