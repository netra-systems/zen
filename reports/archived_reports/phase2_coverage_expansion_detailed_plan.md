## üîç TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### SSOT Compliance Framework
**Pattern:** All tests inherit from established SSOT patterns
```python
from test_framework.ssot.base_test_case import SSotAsyncTestCase
from test_framework.ssot.mock_factory import SSotMockFactory

class TestDomainExpertAgent(SSotAsyncTestCase):
    async def setUp(self):
        await super().setUp()
        self.mock_factory = SSotMockFactory()
        # SSOT patterns only
```

### Business Value Justification Pattern
**Requirements:** Every test method includes BVJ documentation
```python
"""
BUSINESS VALUE JUSTIFICATION (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Enterprise
- Business Goal: $500K+ ARR Golden Path protection
- Value Impact: [Specific customer impact]
- Strategic Impact: [Revenue/experience benefit]
"""
```

### User Isolation Validation
**Critical:** All tests validate multi-user scenarios
```python
async def test_multi_user_isolation_validation(self):
    # Create multiple user contexts
    user1 = UserExecutionContext.create_for_test("user1", "thread1", "run1")
    user2 = UserExecutionContext.create_for_test("user2", "thread2", "run2")

    # Validate isolation between contexts
    # Assert no cross-contamination
```

### Performance Validation Standards
**Requirements:** All tests validate performance SLAs
- **Unit Test Execution:** <2 seconds per test method
- **Test Suite Execution:** <60 seconds total per file
- **Memory Usage:** Bounded per test execution
- **Resource Cleanup:** Complete teardown validation
