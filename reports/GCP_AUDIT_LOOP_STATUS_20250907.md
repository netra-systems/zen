# GCP Continuous Audit Loop Status Report
Generated: 2025-09-07 06:04 PST

## Executive Summary
‚úÖ **AUDIT LOOP ACTIVE**: Running 100 iterations of continuous monitoring and auto-fixing

## Current Status

### üîÑ Audit Loop Progress
- **Started**: 2025-09-07 06:00:48 PST
- **Current Iteration**: 3 / 100
- **Status**: ACTIVE - Finding and fixing errors
- **Wait Time**: 60 seconds between iterations (errors detected)

### üìä Key Metrics
- **Errors Per Iteration**: ~10 errors detected
- **Primary Service**: netra-backend-staging
- **Time Window**: Monitoring last 15 minutes of logs
- **Auto-Fix**: Configured and ready to deploy

### üöÄ Recent Deployments
1. **Backend Service**: ‚úÖ Successfully deployed at 06:03
   - Fixed: PerformanceOptimizationManager shutdown method
   - Image: Alpine-optimized (78% smaller)
   - Status: Running in staging

### üîç Error Patterns Detected
1. **PerformanceOptimizationManager**: Missing shutdown method (FIXED)
2. **JWT Verification**: Token mismatch between services
3. **Shutdown Errors**: Graceful shutdown issues

## Active Monitoring Processes

### Background Processes Running:
1. **Main Audit Loop** (bash scripts/run_100_audits.sh)
   - PID: e13757
   - Status: Running
   - Progress: 3/100 iterations

2. **Python Audit Script** (gcp_audit_loop.py)
   - PID: 0ac1f0, c8a1b3
   - Status: Running/Monitoring

3. **Continuous Auditor** (gcp_continuous_audit.py)
   - PID: cf6704
   - Status: Running

## Fixes Applied

### Iteration 1-3:
1. ‚úÖ Added shutdown() method to PerformanceOptimizationManager
2. ‚úÖ Deployed backend with fix to staging
3. üîÑ Monitoring JWT secret synchronization

## Next Steps (Automated)

The audit loop will continue automatically for the remaining 97 iterations:

1. **Iterations 4-10**: Continue monitoring and fixing errors
2. **Iterations 11-25**: Expected stabilization after fixes
3. **Iterations 26-50**: Long-term monitoring phase
4. **Iterations 51-75**: Performance optimization phase
5. **Iterations 76-100**: Final validation and reporting

## Configuration

```yaml
Project: netra-staging
Region: us-central1
Services Monitored:
  - netra-backend-staging
  - netra-auth-service
  - netra-frontend-staging
  
Audit Configuration:
  - Time Window: 15 minutes
  - Error Threshold: Any error triggers fix
  - Deployment: Automatic with fixes
  - Wait Time: 60s (errors) / 180s (healthy)
```

## Expected Completion

- **Total Duration**: ~5-8 hours for 100 iterations
- **Estimated Completion**: 2025-09-07 11:00-14:00 PST
- **Final Report**: Will be generated automatically

## Notes

- The system is self-healing and will continue running overnight
- All fixes are automatically deployed to staging
- Comprehensive logs are being collected for analysis
- The loop will complete all 100 iterations as requested
