✅ Domain bigcorp.com: Valid=True, Tier=mid
✅ Domain fortune500.com: Valid=True, Tier=enterprise
```

### 5. Integration Health & Performance ✅ PASS

**Performance metrics:**
- Average response time: 342.0ms (EXCELLENT)
- Max response time: 572.9ms (GOOD)
- All health checks passing consistently
- No performance degradation detected

**Integration status:**
- ✅ Auth service integration: FUNCTIONAL
- ✅ Configuration endpoints: RESPONDING
- ✅ Service-to-service communication: HEALTHY

### 6. Auth Service Endpoint Validation ✅ PASS

**Available auth endpoints in staging:**
```
/api/v1/auth/
/api/v1/auth/config  
/api/v1/auth/dev_login
/api/v1/auth/login
/api/v1/auth/logout
/api/v1/auth/protected
