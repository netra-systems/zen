# WebSocket Authentication 403 Error Fix - Five Whys Analysis

**Date:** 2025-09-07  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Business Impact:** $50K MRR affected - Chat functionality completely broken  
**Environment:** GCP Staging (https://api.staging.netrasystems.ai)  
**Issue:** WebSocket connections returning HTTP 403 authentication errors  

## Executive Summary

All WebSocket connections in staging are failing with HTTP 403 errors, preventing chat functionality and breaking 6 critical tests. Using Five Whys methodology, the root cause is that WebSocket authentication uses a different JWT validation path than REST endpoints, causing JWT signature mismatches.

## Five Whys Root Cause Analysis

### WHY #1: Why are WebSocket connections failing?
**Answer:** WebSocket connections are returning HTTP 403 authentication errors.

**Evidence:**
- All 6 tests show HTTP 403 errors on WebSocket connection attempts
- Error occurs during WebSocket handshake before connection establishment
- Both authenticated and test connections fail with same error

### WHY #2: Why are they returning 403 authentication errors?
**Answer:** JWT tokens are being rejected during WebSocket authentication validation.

**Evidence:**
- WebSocket code accepts connection then validates JWT in `websocket.py:159-186`
- User context extractor shows JWT validation failures in logs
- Same tokens work for REST endpoints but fail for WebSocket

### WHY #3: Why are JWT tokens being rejected in WebSocket validation?
**Answer:** WebSocket authentication uses different JWT validation logic than REST middleware.

**Evidence:**
```python
# In user_context_extractor.py:172-177 - WebSocket uses validate_token_with_resilience()
validation_result = await validate_token_with_resilience(token, AuthOperationType.TOKEN_VALIDATION)

# But REST middleware uses different validation path
# This causes JWT secret resolution differences between WebSocket and REST
```

### WHY #4: Why is WebSocket JWT validation different from REST?
**Answer:** WebSocket uses `validate_token_with_resilience()` which has different JWT secret resolution than the REST middleware's direct JWT validation.

**Evidence:**
- WebSocket: Uses `auth_client_core.validate_token_with_resilience()` → Eventually calls `get_unified_jwt_secret()`
- REST: Uses direct JWT secret loading with potentially different environment resolution
- JWT secret manager shows environment-specific resolution (JWT_SECRET_STAGING vs JWT_SECRET_KEY)

### WHY #5: Why is the JWT secret resolution different between services?
**Answer:** Staging environment has different JWT secret configuration patterns that cause mismatches between WebSocket authentication and REST middleware JWT secret resolution.

**Evidence:**
```python
# From jwt_secret_manager.py - Environment-specific resolution:
env_specific_key = f"JWT_SECRET_{environment.upper()}"  # JWT_SECRET_STAGING
jwt_secret = self.env.get(env_specific_key)
```

**ROOT CAUSE:** WebSocket authentication and REST middleware are resolving different JWT secrets in staging environment due to inconsistent environment variable naming and fallback patterns.

## Current vs Ideal State Diagrams

### Current State (Broken) - JWT Secret Mismatch

    participant Client
    participant WebSocket as WebSocket Handler
    participant WSAuth as WebSocket Auth
    participant JWTMgr as JWT Manager
    participant AuthClient as Auth Client
    participant REST as REST Middleware
    
    Note over WebSocket, AuthClient: Different JWT Secret Resolution Paths
    
    Client->>REST: Login Request
    REST->>REST: Uses JWT_SECRET_KEY (direct)
    REST->>Client: Returns JWT Token (signed with secret A)
    
    Client->>WebSocket: WebSocket Connection + JWT
    WebSocket->>WSAuth: Extract & Validate JWT
    WSAuth->>AuthClient: validate_token_with_resilience()
    AuthClient->>JWTMgr: get_unified_jwt_secret()
    JWTMgr->>JWTMgr: Resolves JWT_SECRET_STAGING (secret B)
    
    Note over JWTMgr: Secret A ≠ Secret B
    AuthClient->>WSAuth: JWT Invalid (signature mismatch)
    WSAuth->>WebSocket: Authentication Failed
    WebSocket->>Client: HTTP 403 Forbidden
    
    Note over Client: Chat Functionality Broken
    Note over Client: $50K MRR Impact
```

### Ideal State (Fixed) - Unified JWT Secret Resolution

    Client->>REST: Login Request
    REST->>JWTMgr: get_unified_jwt_secret()
    JWTMgr->>JWTMgr: Unified Resolution Logic
    REST->>Client: Returns JWT Token (signed with unified secret)
    
    Client->>WebSocket: WebSocket Connection + JWT
    WebSocket->>WSAuth: Extract & Validate JWT
    WSAuth->>JWTMgr: get_unified_jwt_secret() (SAME LOGIC)
    JWTMgr->>JWTMgr: Unified Resolution Logic (SAME SECRET)
    WSAuth->>WebSocket: JWT Valid ✅
    WebSocket->>Client: Connection Established
    
    Note over Client: Chat Functionality Working
    Note over Client: $50K MRR Protected
```

## Technical Implementation Fix

### Problem Areas Identified

1. **WebSocket JWT Validation Path:** `user_context_extractor.py:validate_and_decode_jwt()` uses different logic
2. **JWT Secret Resolution:** Multiple environment variable fallbacks causing mismatches
3. **Staging Configuration:** Missing JWT_SECRET_STAGING or inconsistent naming

### Fix Strategy

1. **Ensure Consistent JWT Secret Resolution**
   - Both WebSocket and REST must use `get_unified_jwt_secret()`
   - Verify staging environment has correct JWT secret configuration
   - Add debugging to show which JWT secret is being used

2. **Update WebSocket Authentication**
   - Ensure WebSocket uses same JWT validation logic as REST
   - Add comprehensive logging for JWT validation steps
   - Fix pre-connection authentication to prevent 403 errors

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Ensure JWT_SECRET_STAGING is properly set in GCP staging
   - Add fallback handling for missing environment variables
   - Validate JWT secret consistency between services

## Verification Test

The fix will be verified by creating a test that:
1. Generates a JWT token using REST endpoint JWT logic
2. Attempts WebSocket connection with that token
3. Verifies successful connection (no 403 error)
4. Confirms both services use the same JWT secret

## Expected Business Impact After Fix

- **Chat Functionality:** Fully operational in staging
- **User Experience:** Real-time agent updates working
- **Test Suite:** All 6 WebSocket tests passing
- **Revenue Protection:** $50K MRR chat revenue secured

## Implementation Priority

**CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**
- Priority 1: Fix JWT secret consistency
- Priority 2: Update WebSocket authentication logic  
- Priority 3: Verify staging environment configuration
- Priority 4: Deploy and validate fix

This fix addresses the core authentication infrastructure that enables our $50K MRR chat functionality.
