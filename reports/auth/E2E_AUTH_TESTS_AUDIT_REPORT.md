## Business Value Enhancements

### 1. Performance Context
- All performance assertions now include business impact context
- Performance targets linked to user experience (login flow, scalability, chat interactions)

### 2. Error Message Quality
- Enhanced error messages with business value context
- Added "SECURITY VIOLATION" tags for critical security boundaries
- Improved diagnostic information for troubleshooting

### 3. Comprehensive Event Validation
- All 5 critical WebSocket events validated for chat business value
- Event timing and ordering validated for user experience
- Authentication persistence validated for connection reliability

## Compliance Verification

### ✅ CLAUDE.md Requirements Satisfied:
1. **Real Services Only:** NO mocks used - all tests use real authentication services
2. **SSOT Authentication:** All tests use `test_framework/ssot/e2e_auth_helper.py`
3. **Performance Targets:** All tests complete in <5 seconds with business context
4. **Error Handling:** Tests raise errors properly, no try/except masking failures
5. **Environment Isolation:** Uses `IsolatedEnvironment`, never `os.environ` directly
6. **Business Value Justification:** Comprehensive BVJ in all test docstrings
7. **Multi-User Focus:** All tests designed for multi-user platform requirements
8. **WebSocket Events:** All 5 critical events validated for chat business value
