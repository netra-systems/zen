# Manual Update Instructions for GitHub Issue #1176

## Issue Status Discrepancy Identified

**CRITICAL FINDING:** There is a conflicting status between:
1. **Comprehensive Five Whys Analysis** (Sept 16): Shows active critical failures requiring P0 intervention
2. **Master WIP Status** (Sept 16): Claims "ALL PHASES COMPLETE" and "READY FOR CLOSURE"

This represents exactly the documentation-reality disconnect that Issue #1176 was created to address.

## GitHub CLI Commands (Requires Manual Execution)

```bash

## Critical Evidence Summary

The Five Whys analysis reveals that Issue #1176 cannot be closed because:

1. **Technical Evidence (Sept 15-16):**
   - Unit Tests: 54% failure rate (20 failed / 17 passed)
   - Integration Tests: 71% failure rate (12 failed / 5 passed)
   - E2E Staging Tests: 100% failure rate (7 failed / 0 passed)
   - Active test files for Issue #1176 still being created

2. **Business Impact Evidence:**
   - Golden Path user journey: 100% E2E failure in staging
   - $500K+ ARR functionality at risk
   - Core chat functionality unvalidated

3. **Root Cause Evidence:**
   - Recursive pattern detected: Issue #1176 becoming a manifestation of the problem it was created to solve
   - Documentation claiming resolution while empirical evidence shows ongoing failures
   - Test infrastructure still producing false positives

## Recommendation

**KEEP ISSUE #1176 OPEN** until:
- All actual test failures are resolved (>90% pass rate achieved)
- Golden Path E2E validation passes in staging
- Documentation aligns with empirical test results
- No more "0 tests executed" success reports
