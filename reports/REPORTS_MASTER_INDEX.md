├── bug-fixes/        # Bug fix reports and Five Whys analyses
├── config/           # Configuration and environment reports
├── deployment/       # Deployment strategies and reports
├── docker/           # Docker infrastructure and container reports
├── migration/        # Migration plans and reports
├── security/         # Security audits and vulnerability reports
├── ssot-compliance/  # Single Source of Truth compliance reports
