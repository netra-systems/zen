## üöÄ IMMEDIATE EXECUTION PLAN

### READY-TO-EXECUTE COMMANDS

#### Step 1: Infrastructure Validation
```bash
# Confirm readiness (already completed)
python scripts/validate_migration_readiness.py
```

#### Step 2: Batch 1 Execution (Business Critical)
```bash
# Dry run first (RECOMMENDED)
python scripts/migrate_mock_to_usercontext.py --execute-batch 1 --dry-run

# Execute with auto-commit
python scripts/migrate_mock_to_usercontext.py --execute-batch 1 --auto-commit
```

#### Step 3: Validation & Testing
```bash
# Test Golden Path functionality
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py

# Validate core business functionality
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category mission_critical --real-services
```

#### Step 4: Batch 2 & 3 Execution (After Batch 1 Success)
```bash
# Integration tests
python scripts/migrate_mock_to_usercontext.py --execute-batch 2 --auto-commit

# Unit tests (when time permits)  
python scripts/migrate_mock_to_usercontext.py --execute-batch 3 --auto-commit
```
