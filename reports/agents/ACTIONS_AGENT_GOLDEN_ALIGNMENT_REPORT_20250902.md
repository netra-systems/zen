- Mapped 74+ consumer dependencies
- Documented inheritance hierarchy
- Cross-referenced with golden patterns

**Key Findings:**
- Clean 4-level inheritance chain: ActionsAgent → BaseAgent → ABC → object
- 38 methods properly inherited from BaseAgent
- WebSocket methods fully compliant
- Infrastructure duplication in 5 areas

### 2. Comprehensive Test Suite Creation ✅
**Agent:** Test Suite Developer
- Created `tests/mission_critical/test_actions_agent_golden_compliance.py` (638 lines)
- Created `tests/integration/agents/test_actions_agent_ssot.py` (800+ lines)
- Created `tests/e2e/test_actions_agent_full_flow.py` (700+ lines)

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ BaseAgent inheritance validation
- ✅ All 5 WebSocket events validation
- ✅ SSOT compliance checks
- ✅ Circuit breaker and retry patterns
- ✅ Real LLM integration (NO MOCKS)
- ✅ Graceful degradation scenarios
- ✅ Performance benchmarks

### 3. Golden Pattern Refactoring ✅
**Agent:** Refactoring Specialist
- Reduced code from 454 to 201 lines (56% reduction)
- Removed all infrastructure duplication
- Consolidated 4 split files into single agent
- Implemented required abstract methods
- Maintained backward compatibility

**Files Removed:**
- `actions_agent_core.py` (114 lines)
- `actions_agent_execution.py` (153 lines)
- `actions_agent_monitoring.py` (67 lines)
- `actions_agent_llm.py` (77 lines)

### 4. WebSocket Integration Validation ✅
**Agent:** WebSocket Validation Specialist
- Validated all 5 required events implementation
- Created WebSocket flow documentation
- Fixed missing `agent_started` and `agent_completed` events
- Performance validation: <1ms event latency
- Created `tests/mission_critical/test_actions_agent_websocket_events.py`

**WebSocket Events Implemented:**
1. `agent_started` - User sees AI processing start
2. `agent_thinking` - Real-time reasoning visibility
3. `tool_executing` - Tool usage transparency
4. `tool_completed` - Results display
5. `agent_completed` - Clear completion notification
