## Detailed SSOT Violations Analysis

### Current SSOT Violation Statistics
```
Real System Violations: 335 violations in 142 files (83.5% compliant)
├── Critical: 10 violations (stored database sessions, user data)
├── High: 51 violations (missing context parameters) 
├── Medium: 35 violations (custom retry logic, hash generation)
└── Total: 96 violations requiring remediation
```

### Key SSOT Violation Categories
1. **Missing Context Parameters (44 violations):** Agents missing UserExecutionContext
2. **Custom Retry Logic (29 violations):** Should use UnifiedRetryHandler
3. **Stored User Data (7 violations):** User data in instance variables
4. **Custom JSON Parsing (7 violations):** Should use JsonHelpers
5. **Custom Hash Generation (6 violations):** Should use CacheHelpers
6. **Stored DB Sessions (3 violations):** Database sessions in instance variables

**Session Impact:** **ZERO** of these violations were introduced during the session.
