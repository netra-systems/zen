## Key Patterns from Deleted Reports

### Common Root Causes
1. **Environment Variable Management**
   - Missing or incorrect environment variables
   - Cross-environment configuration leaks
   - Improper use of IsolatedEnvironment

2. **WebSocket Integration**
   - Missing event emissions
   - Authentication flow issues
   - Event ordering problems

3. **Database Connectivity**
   - URL construction errors
   - Timeout configuration
   - Connection pool management

4. **Import Structure**
   - Circular dependencies
   - Service boundary violations
   - Legacy reference cleanup

### Regression Prevention Checklist
When encountering similar issues, check:
- [ ] IsolatedEnvironment usage for all env vars
- [ ] WebSocket manager initialization and event flow
- [ ] Database URL construction per environment
- [ ] JWT secret configuration
- [ ] Import paths and service boundaries
- [ ] Test environment isolation
- [ ] Agent execution order and notifications
