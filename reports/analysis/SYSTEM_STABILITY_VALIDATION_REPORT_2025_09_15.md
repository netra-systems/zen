### **Critical Finding: NO NEW FAILURES**
The current test failure patterns match **EXISTING KNOWN ISSUES** documented in the system:

1. **WebSocket Manager SSOT Warnings:** Pre-existing fragmentation issue (documented Issue #1144)
2. **Agent Execution Timeouts:** Pre-existing performance issue (documented in Phase 3 worklog)
3. **Test Infrastructure Gaps:** Pre-existing test configuration issues (not system failures)

**STABILITY CONFIRMATION:** No new failure patterns introduced during E2E testing process.
