# Audit Report: Failed Revision 00216-7vd

## Executive Summary
Revision `netra-backend-staging-00216-7vd` failed to deploy due to a critical import error. The container repeatedly crashed on startup, unable to find the module `netra_backend.app.schemas.llm_config_types`.

## Deployment Timeline
- **Deployment Time**: 2025-09-04 23:10:00 UTC
- **Build Status**: Successful (Cloud Build)
- **Runtime Status**: Failed (Container exit code 1)
- **Failure Pattern**: Repeated crashes across multiple restart attempts

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
**ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'netra_backend.app.schemas.llm_config_types'**

The application failed to start due to a missing Python module during import chain:
```
netra_backend.app.main 
  → netra_backend.app.core.app_factory 
    → netra_backend.app.core.unified_error_handler 
      → netra_backend.app.schemas.core_enums 
        → netra_backend.app.schemas.__init__ (line 279)
          → netra_backend.app.schemas.llm_config_types ❌ MODULE NOT FOUND
```

### Failure Pattern
- Container started → Import error → Exit code 1 → Cloud Run health check failed
- This pattern repeated 10+ times before Cloud Run gave up
- Each attempt lasted ~2-3 seconds before crashing

## Critical Findings

### 1. File Exists Locally but Not in Docker Image
- **Local Status**: File `netra_backend/app/schemas/llm_config_types.py` exists (4177 bytes)
- **Docker Status**: File not included in the built image
- **Probable Cause**: File not copied to Docker container during build

### 2. Docker Build Configuration Issue
The `backend.gcp.Dockerfile` copies:
```dockerfile
COPY netra_backend/ ./netra_backend/
COPY shared/ ./shared/
```

Possible issues:
- File might be in `.dockerignore`
- File might not have been committed to git
- Build context might have excluded the file

### 3. Comparison with Successful Revision
- **Working Revision**: `00215-tb5` (image sha256:aac6481c5943...)
- **Failed Revision**: `00216-7vd` (image sha256:a17703e98098...)
- Different image hashes confirm different build artifacts

## Impact Assessment

### Service Availability
- No impact to production - previous revision (00215-tb5) continues serving 100% traffic
- Cloud Run automatically rolled back to the last working revision
- Service health endpoint confirms system is operational

### Deployment Pipeline
- Cloud Build succeeded but produced an incomplete image
- Highlights gap in build-time validation
- No pre-deployment smoke tests caught the missing module

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Verify File Inclusion**:
   - Check `.dockerignore` for exclusion patterns
   - Ensure `llm_config_types.py` is committed to git
   - Verify file permissions

2. **Rebuild and Redeploy**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure file is staged
   git add netra_backend/app/schemas/llm_config_types.py
   git commit -m "fix: ensure llm_config_types.py is included in Docker build"
   
   # Rebuild with verification
   python scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py --project netra-staging --service backend
   ```

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Build Validation**:
   - Add import verification step in Dockerfile
   - Run basic Python import checks before deploying

2. **Pre-deployment Testing**:
   - Add smoke test that imports all modules
   - Verify critical paths before promoting revision

3. **Monitoring Enhancement**:
   - Add structured logging for import errors
   - Implement better error reporting for startup failures

## Logs Evidence

### Startup Failure Pattern
```
23:11:57 INFO     Starting new instance (min-instances configuration)
23:11:59 CRITICAL ModuleNotFoundError: 'netra_backend.app.schemas.llm_config_types'
23:11:59 WARNING  Container called exit(1)
23:12:01 ERROR    STARTUP TCP probe failed on port 8000
```

### Error Frequency
- 10+ identical failures over 2-minute period
- Each failure triggered automatic restart
- Cloud Run eventually stopped trying after repeated failures

## Conclusion
The deployment failure was caused by a missing Python module in the Docker image. While the build succeeded, the runtime failed immediately due to import errors. The system's resilience features (automatic rollback) prevented service disruption, maintaining 100% availability on the previous working revision.

**Status**: Issue identified, fix pending
**Risk Level**: Low (rollback successful, no service impact)
**Next Steps**: Verify file inclusion and redeploy with proper validation
