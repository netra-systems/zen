# Issue #914 AgentRegistry SSOT Duplication - Comprehensive Test Plan

**AGENT_SESSION_ID:** agent-session-2025-09-14-1204  
**ISSUE STATUS:** P0 Critical - SSOT violations impacting $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality  
**TEST METHODOLOGY:** Create failing tests first to demonstrate the problem, then validate fixes

## Executive Summary

This test plan creates comprehensive failing tests to demonstrate how AgentRegistry SSOT duplication causes:
1. **WebSocket Bridge Factory Import Conflicts** - Multiple registry classes causing inconsistent factory resolution
2. **Agent Initialization Inconsistencies** - Different registries initializing different agent instances
3. **Golden Path WebSocket Event Delivery Failures** - Registry confusion preventing proper event routing to users

## CRITICAL BUSINESS IMPACT

- **Revenue at Risk:** $500K+ ARR Golden Path chat functionality compromised
- **User Experience:** WebSocket events not delivered due to registry confusion
- **System Reliability:** Multiple registration sources creating race conditions
- **Development Velocity:** Import conflicts preventing consistent agent execution

## Test Suite Architecture 

### Phase 1: SSOT Violation Detection Tests (Expected to FAIL)
**Location:** `tests/mission_critical/test_agent_registry_ssot_duplication_violations.py`

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that multiple AgentRegistry classes exist and cause conflicts

#### Test 1.1: Registry Class Duplication Detection
```python
def test_multiple_agent_registry_classes_exist():
    """
    CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL initially to prove SSOT violations.
    
    Validates that multiple AgentRegistry classes exist in the codebase,
    violating SSOT principles and causing import conflicts.
    """
    # Expected to FAIL: Should find exactly 1 AgentRegistry, will find 2+
    registry_locations = scan_for_agent_registry_classes()
    assert len(registry_locations) == 1, f"SSOT VIOLATION: Found {len(registry_locations)} AgentRegistry classes: {registry_locations}"
```

#### Test 1.2: Import Path Consistency Validation
```python
def test_agent_registry_import_path_consistency():
    """
    CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL initially to prove import conflicts.
    
    Validates that all modules importing AgentRegistry use the same path,
    preventing factory pattern inconsistencies.
    """
    # Expected to FAIL: Will find inconsistent import paths
    import_analysis = analyze_agent_registry_imports()
    unique_import_paths = set(import_analysis.keys())
    assert len(unique_import_paths) == 1, f"SSOT VIOLATION: Multiple import paths found: {unique_import_paths}"
```

### Phase 2: WebSocket Bridge Factory Conflict Tests (Expected to FAIL)
**Location:** `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_bridge_factory_conflicts.py`

**Purpose:** Demonstrate how registry duplication causes WebSocket bridge factory issues

#### Test 2.1: Bridge Factory Import Resolution
```python
def test_websocket_bridge_factory_import_consistency():
    """
    CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL initially to prove factory conflicts.
    
    Validates that create_agent_websocket_bridge factory function 
    resolves consistently across all usage contexts.
    """
    # Expected to FAIL: Different registries will resolve different factory instances
    factory_instances = collect_bridge_factory_instances()
    assert all_factories_identical(factory_instances), f"FACTORY CONFLICT: Found {len(factory_instances)} different factory resolutions"
```

#### Test 2.2: Registry-Bridge Integration Consistency  
```python
def test_registry_bridge_integration_consistency():
    """
    CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL initially to prove integration conflicts.
    
    Validates that all AgentRegistry instances integrate with WebSocket bridges
    using the same factory pattern and interface contracts.
    """
    # Expected to FAIL: Different registries will have different bridge integration approaches
    registries = get_all_agent_registry_instances()
    bridge_integrations = [analyze_bridge_integration(r) for r in registries]
    assert all_integrations_consistent(bridge_integrations), f"INTEGRATION CONFLICT: Found inconsistent bridge integrations"
```

### Phase 3: Golden Path Event Delivery Tests (Expected to FAIL)
**Location:** `tests/mission_critical/test_golden_path_registry_event_failures.py`

**Purpose:** Demonstrate how registry confusion prevents proper WebSocket event delivery to users

#### Test 3.1: Agent Registration Confusion
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_agent_registration_creates_event_delivery_confusion():
    """
    CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL initially to prove event delivery issues.
    
    Validates that agent registration through different registry classes
    doesn't cause WebSocket event delivery confusion or cross-user contamination.
    """
    user_1_context = create_test_user_context("user_1") 
    user_2_context = create_test_user_context("user_2")
    
    # Register agents through different registry paths (this will cause confusion)
    agent_1 = await register_agent_via_primary_registry(user_1_context)
    agent_2 = await register_agent_via_supervisor_registry(user_2_context)  # Different registry!
    
    # Execute agents and collect WebSocket events
    user_1_events = await execute_agent_and_collect_events(agent_1, user_1_context)
    user_2_events = await execute_agent_and_collect_events(agent_2, user_2_context)
    
    # Expected to FAIL: Events will be mixed up due to registry confusion
    assert no_event_cross_contamination(user_1_events, user_2_events), "REGISTRY CONFUSION: WebSocket events delivered to wrong users"
```

#### Test 3.2: Golden Path Event Sequence Validation
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio 
async def test_golden_path_websocket_events_via_registry_consistency():
    """
    CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL initially to prove Golden Path impact.
    
    Validates that the complete Golden Path WebSocket event sequence
    (agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, tool_completed, agent_completed)
    works consistently regardless of which AgentRegistry is used.
    """
    test_user = create_test_user_context("golden_path_user")
    
    # Test both registry paths for same user
    primary_registry_events = await execute_golden_path_via_primary_registry(test_user)
    supervisor_registry_events = await execute_golden_path_via_supervisor_registry(test_user)
    
    # Expected to FAIL: Different registries will produce different event sequences
    assert events_sequences_identical(primary_registry_events, supervisor_registry_events), "GOLDEN PATH INCONSISTENCY: Different registries produce different event sequences"
```

### Phase 4: Multi-User Concurrency Registry Tests (Expected to FAIL)  
**Location:** `tests/mission_critical/test_registry_duplication_concurrency_failures.py`

**Purpose:** Demonstrate how registry duplication causes race conditions in multi-user scenarios

#### Test 4.1: Concurrent User Registry Access
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_concurrent_users_registry_access_race_conditions():
    """
    CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL initially to prove concurrency issues.
    
    Validates that multiple users accessing agents concurrently don't
    experience registry conflicts or cross-user contamination.
    """
    # Create 5 concurrent users
    users = [create_test_user_context(f"user_{i}") for i in range(5)]
    
    # Execute concurrent agent requests (this will expose registry conflicts)
    concurrent_results = await asyncio.gather(*[
        execute_agent_via_random_registry(user) for user in users
    ])
    
    # Expected to FAIL: Registry conflicts will cause cross-user contamination
    assert no_cross_user_contamination(concurrent_results), "CONCURRENCY FAILURE: Registry duplication caused cross-user contamination"
```

### Phase 5: SSOT Remediation Validation Tests (Expected to PASS after fix)
**Location:** `tests/mission_critical/test_agent_registry_ssot_remediation_validation.py`

**Purpose:** Validate that SSOT consolidation resolves all identified issues

#### Test 5.1: Single Source Registry Validation  
```python
def test_single_agent_registry_ssot_compliance():
    """
    VALIDATION: This test must PASS after SSOT remediation.
    
    Validates that exactly one canonical AgentRegistry exists and
    all imports resolve to the same SSOT implementation.
    """
    # After fix: Should find exactly 1 registry
    registries = scan_for_agent_registry_classes()
    assert len(registries) == 1, f"SSOT SUCCESS: Found single registry: {registries[0]}"
    
    # All imports should resolve to same path
    imports = analyze_agent_registry_imports()
    unique_paths = set(imports.keys()) 
    assert len(unique_paths) == 1, f"IMPORT SUCCESS: All imports use single path: {list(unique_paths)[0]}"
```

## Test Execution Strategy

### Environment Requirements
- **NO DOCKER REQUIRED** - All tests designed for local unit/integration execution
- **GCP Staging Available** - E2E validation tests can run on staging environment  
- **Real Services Preferred** - Tests use real WebSocket connections and agent execution where possible

### Test Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Expected Result | Environment |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **P0** | SSOT Violation Detection | MUST FAIL | Local Unit |
| **P0** | WebSocket Factory Conflicts | MUST FAIL | Local Integration |  
| **P0** | Golden Path Event Failures | MUST FAIL | Local Integration |
| **P1** | Concurrency Race Conditions | MUST FAIL | Local Integration |
| **P2** | SSOT Remediation Validation | MUST PASS (after fix) | All Environments |

### Execution Commands
