# WebSocket Message Routing Fragmentation Test Plan
**Issue #994 - SSOT Regression WebSocket Message Routing Fragmentation**

## 🚨 Executive Summary

**Business Impact:** Critical Golden Path blocker - Users not receiving AI responses due to WebSocket message routing fragmentation preventing proper tool dispatching and agent execution.

**Problem:** Multiple fragmented WebSocket message routing implementations causing delivery failures and blocking $500K+ ARR user flow.

**Test Strategy:** Create comprehensive test suites to reproduce fragmentation issues, validate SSOT consolidation requirements, and ensure Golden Path reliability restoration to 99.5%.

## 📋 Current Fragmentation Analysis

### Identified Router Implementations

1. **MessageRouter** (`netra_backend/app/websocket_core/handlers.py:1250`)
   - Main message router with handler-based architecture
   - Contains QualityRouterHandler integration
   - Manages custom and builtin handlers

2. **QualityMessageRouter** (`netra_backend/app/services/websocket/quality_message_router.py:36`)
   - Quality-specific message routing
   - Separate handler initialization and management
   - Dedicated quality gate and monitoring integration

3. **WebSocketEventRouter** (`netra_backend/app/services/websocket_event_router.py:41`)
   - Connection pool management and event routing
   - User isolation and connection info tracking
   - Infrastructure layer for per-user event emission

4. **QualityRouterHandler** (within MessageRouter)
   - Handler bridge between MessageRouter and quality systems
   - Delegates to router's quality message handling

### SSOT Violation Impact
- **6+ implementations** should consolidate to single authoritative router
- **Event routing scattered** across multiple files instead of centralized
- **Message handling inconsistencies** between different routing implementations
- **Golden Path failure points** where routing conflicts cause tool dispatch failures
