## Critical Infrastructure Fixes Applied

### 1. Terraform Load Balancer Configuration - FIXED ✅

**File:** `terraform-gcp-staging/load-balancer.tf`

**CRITICAL FIX 1 - Backend Service Timeout:**
```terraform
# BEFORE: timeout_sec = 30 (causes WebSocket disconnections)
# AFTER:  timeout_sec = var.backend_timeout_sec (24 hours)

resource "google_compute_backend_service" "api_backend" {
  timeout_sec = var.backend_timeout_sec  # CRITICAL FIX: 24-hour timeout
  
  # CRITICAL FIX: WebSocket upgrade headers added
  custom_request_headers = [
    "X-Forwarded-Proto: https",
    "Connection: upgrade",      # NEW
    "Upgrade: websocket"        # NEW
  ]
  
  # CRITICAL FIX: Session affinity for WebSocket connections
  session_affinity = "GENERATED_COOKIE"
  affinity_cookie_ttl_sec = var.session_affinity_ttl_sec  # 24 hours
}
```

**CRITICAL FIX 2 - WebSocket Path Routing:**
```terraform
# CRITICAL FIX: Dedicated WebSocket timeout for long-lived connections
path_rule {
  paths   = ["/ws", "/ws/*", "/websocket", "/websocket/*"]
  service = google_compute_backend_service.api_backend.id
  
  route_action {
    timeout {
      seconds = var.websocket_timeout_sec  # NEW: 24-hour WebSocket timeout
    }
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL FIX 3 - WebSocket Headers:**
```terraform
# CRITICAL FIX: Add header transformations for WebSocket support
header_action {
  request_headers_to_add {
    header_name  = "X-Forwarded-Proto"
    header_value = "https"
    replace      = false
  }
  
  request_headers_to_add {
    header_name  = "X-WebSocket-Upgrade"    # NEW
    header_value = "true"                   # NEW
    replace      = true
  }
}
```

### 2. Terraform Variables Configuration - FIXED ✅

**File:** `terraform-gcp-staging/variables.tf`

**CRITICAL FIX - WebSocket Timeout Variables:**
```terraform
# BEFORE: backend_timeout_sec = 3600 (1 hour)
# AFTER:  backend_timeout_sec = 86400 (24 hours)

variable "backend_timeout_sec" {
  description = "Backend service timeout in seconds for WebSocket support"
  type        = number
  default     = 86400  # CRITICAL FIX: Increased to 24 hours
}

variable "session_affinity_ttl_sec" {
  description = "Session affinity cookie TTL in seconds"
  type        = number
  default     = 86400  # CRITICAL FIX: Increased to 24 hours
}

# NEW VARIABLE: Dedicated WebSocket timeout
variable "websocket_timeout_sec" {
  description = "WebSocket connection timeout in seconds for long-lived connections"
  type        = number
  default     = 86400  # 24 hours for WebSocket connections
}
```

### 3. WebSocket Deployment Validation Tools - CREATED ✅

**File:** `scripts/validate_websocket_simple.py`

**CRITICAL VALIDATION CAPABILITIES:**
- ✅ Multi-endpoint WebSocket connectivity testing (`/ws`, `/ws/test`, `/websocket`)
- ✅ WebSocket timeout validation (40+ second connection duration)
- ✅ Windows-compatible execution (no Unicode issues)
- ✅ Detailed failure reporting for troubleshooting
- ✅ Environment-specific URL configuration (staging/production)

**VALIDATION RESULTS - PRE-DEPLOYMENT BASELINE:**
```
=== WebSocket Validation - STAGING ===

1. Testing WebSocket Connection...
Testing: wss://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/ws/test
  FAILED: Connection timeout/protocol errors (EXPECTED - infrastructure not deployed yet)

OVERALL: FAILED - Issues detected (EXPECTED PRE-DEPLOYMENT STATE)
```

**POST-DEPLOYMENT EXPECTED RESULTS:**
```
=== WebSocket Validation - STAGING ===

1. Testing WebSocket Connection...
Testing: wss://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/ws/test
  SUCCESS: Connected successfully to /ws/test

2. Testing WebSocket Timeout...
  Connection alive at 5.0s
  Connection alive at 10.0s
  Connection alive at 35.0s
  SUCCESS: Connection lasted 40.0s (timeout fixed)

OVERALL: SUCCESS - WebSocket deployment ready
```

## Zero-Downtime Deployment Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Validate Terraform configuration
cd terraform-gcp-staging
terraform validate
# Expected: "Success! The configuration is valid."

# 2. Establish baseline WebSocket connectivity
cd ..
python scripts/validate_websocket_simple.py staging
# Expected: FAILED (current broken state)

# 3. Plan infrastructure changes
terraform plan
# Expected: Shows load balancer timeout changes, header additions
```

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Deployment (10 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Apply Terraform changes (load balancer fixes)
cd terraform-gcp-staging
terraform apply -auto-approve

# 2. Wait for GCP load balancer propagation
echo "Waiting for load balancer configuration to propagate..."
sleep 120  # 2 minutes for global load balancer changes

# 3. Verify infrastructure deployment
terraform show | grep -E "(timeout_sec|custom_request_headers|websocket_timeout_sec)"
```

### Phase 3: Service Deployment (15 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Deploy backend with WebSocket environment variables
python scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py --project netra-staging --service backend --build-local

# 2. Deploy auth service 
python scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py --project netra-staging --service auth --build-local

# 3. Deploy frontend
python scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py --project netra-staging --service frontend --build-local
```

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment Validation (10 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Validate WebSocket connectivity restoration
python scripts/validate_websocket_simple.py staging
# Expected: SUCCESS - All tests pass

# 2. Run comprehensive WebSocket business value tests
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category e2e --env staging --keyword websocket

# 3. Monitor WebSocket health for 2 minutes
# (WebSocket connections should now last 24+ hours instead of 30 seconds)
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- WebSocket validation script returns FAILED status
- Any service deployment failure
- HTTP 500 error rate increase > 20%
- WebSocket handshake failure rate > 10%

### Infrastructure Rollback Commands
```bash
# Revert Terraform changes
cd terraform-gcp-staging
git checkout HEAD~1 -- load-balancer.tf variables.tf
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Restore previous load balancer configuration
sleep 120  # Wait for propagation
```

### Service Rollback Commands
```bash
# Rollback Cloud Run services to previous revision
gcloud run services update-traffic netra-backend-staging \
  --to-revisions=PREVIOUS=100 \
  --platform=managed \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --project=netra-staging
```

## Business Impact Assessment

### Pre-Deployment State (BROKEN)
- ❌ **WebSocket connections fail after 30 seconds** due to load balancer timeout
- ❌ **HTTP 403 errors during WebSocket handshake** due to missing upgrade headers  
- ❌ **Chat functionality completely non-functional** in staging environment
- ❌ **$180K+ MRR at risk** - cannot validate production deployments
- ❌ **All 7 critical WebSocket tests failing** in staging environment

### Post-Deployment State (EXPECTED)
- ✅ **WebSocket connections stable for 24+ hours** with proper timeout configuration
- ✅ **WebSocket handshake success rate > 95%** with proper upgrade headers
- ✅ **Chat functionality fully operational** - real-time agent events working
