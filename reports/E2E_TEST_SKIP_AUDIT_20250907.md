# E2E Test Skip Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-09-07  
**Status:** CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

## Executive Summary
E2E tests are being systematically skipped due to a missing environment variable `RUN_E2E_TESTS` that is never set by the unified test runner. This causes all E2E tests to be skipped unless manually overridden.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Skip Condition in conftest_e2e.py
**Location:** `tests/conftest_e2e.py:333-334`
```python
if not (get_env().get("RUN_E2E_TESTS", "false").lower() == "true" or is_staging):
    pytest.skip("E2E tests disabled (set RUN_E2E_TESTS=true to enable or ENVIRONMENT=staging)")
```

### 2. Missing Environment Variable in Test Runner
**Issue:** The unified test runner (`tests/unified_test_runner.py`) never sets `RUN_E2E_TESTS=true`
- The runner detects when e2e category is selected
- It properly starts Docker services for e2e tests  
- But it fails to set the required environment variable

### 3. Impact
- **All E2E tests are skipped** unless:
  - `RUN_E2E_TESTS=true` is manually set before running tests
  - `ENVIRONMENT=staging` is set (which triggers staging mode)
- This affects approximately **200+ E2E test files** in `tests/e2e/`

## Critical Findings

### Test Infrastructure Issues
1. **Disconnected Logic:** The test runner knows it's running e2e tests (via `running_e2e` variable) but doesn't communicate this to the test framework
2. **Documentation Gap:** No documentation mentions the need to set `RUN_E2E_TESTS=true`
3. **Silent Failures:** Tests appear to "pass" by being skipped, masking the real issue

### Business Impact
- **90% of business value validation missing** - E2E tests validate the complete chat flow which delivers core business value
- **WebSocket event validation skipped** - Critical for user experience
- **Agent orchestration untested** - Multi-agent coordination not validated
- **False confidence** - CI/CD shows green but critical paths untested

## Immediate Fix Required

### Solution 1: Fix the Test Runner (RECOMMENDED)
Add this code to `tests/unified_test_runner.py` around line 1067 where `running_e2e` is detected:

```python
if running_e2e:
    env = get_env()
    env.set('RUN_E2E_TESTS', 'true', 'test_runner')
    logger.info("Enabled E2E tests execution (RUN_E2E_TESTS=true)")
```

### Solution 2: Update conftest_e2e.py
Modify the skip condition to check for e2e category detection:

```python
# Check if we're running e2e tests
is_e2e_category = any([
    'e2e' in str(item.fspath) for item in request.session.items
])

if not (is_e2e_category or get_env().get("RUN_E2E_TESTS", "false").lower() == "true" or is_staging):
    pytest.skip("E2E tests disabled")
```

### Solution 3: Temporary Workaround
Until fixed, manually set the environment variable:
```bash
# Windows
set RUN_E2E_TESTS=true
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category e2e --real-services

# Linux/Mac
RUN_E2E_TESTS=true python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category e2e --real-services
```

## Verification Steps

### Test the Fix
1. Apply the recommended fix to unified_test_runner.py
2. Run: `python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category e2e --real-services`
3. Verify tests execute instead of being skipped
4. Check test output for "agent_started", "agent_thinking" events

### Expected Results After Fix
- E2E tests should execute when `--category e2e` is specified
- WebSocket events should be validated
- Agent orchestration should be tested
- Real services integration should be verified

## Related Issues Found

### Additional Skip Patterns
Several e2e tests have individual skip conditions:
- WebSocket connection failures cause skips
- Missing agent service causes skips  
- Service health check failures cause skips

These are acceptable as they represent actual infrastructure issues, not configuration problems.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **PRIORITY 1:** Implement Solution 1 in unified_test_runner.py
2. **PRIORITY 2:** Run full e2e test suite to identify any failing tests
3. **PRIORITY 3:** Update CI/CD pipeline to ensure RUN_E2E_TESTS is set

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Consolidate skip logic** - Move all e2e skip decisions to one location
2. **Add diagnostics** - Log when tests are skipped and why
3. **Documentation** - Update test runner documentation with environment variables
4. **Monitoring** - Add metrics for skipped vs executed tests

## Compliance Check
Per CLAUDE.md requirements:
- ✅ Real services required for e2e tests (Docker integration working)
- ❌ E2E tests not executing (environment variable missing)
- ✅ WebSocket event validation implemented (but not running)
- ✅ Business value validation tests exist (but not running)

## Conclusion
This is a **CRITICAL BUG** that has been preventing all E2E tests from running. The fix is simple (3 lines of code) but the impact is massive - without E2E tests, the system's core business value delivery (chat functionality) is not being validated.

**Immediate action required to restore E2E test coverage.**
