# 🛡️ Issue #463 Remediation Execution Results - WebSocket Authentication Failures

**Issue**: [#463](https://github.com/your-org/netra-core-generation-1/issues/463) - WebSocket authentication failures in staging  
**Priority**: P0 - Blocks chat functionality (90% of platform value)  
**Status**: ✅ **EXECUTION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**  
**Environment**: GCP Staging  

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**✅ REMEDIATION SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED**: All deployment and validation steps from the remediation plan have been completed successfully. WebSocket authentication failures in staging environment have been resolved through proper deployment of critical environment variables (`SERVICE_SECRET`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `SERVICE_ID`, and related authentication configuration).

**✅ BUSINESS IMPACT RESTORED**: $500K+ ARR functionality is now operational - Chat functionality restored with proper WebSocket handshake completion and service user `service:netra-backend` authentication working correctly.
