# Test Iteration 2 - 2025-09-07 09:25:00

## Initial Test Run - Priority 1 Tests

### Summary
- **Total Modules**: 10
- **Passed**: 7 (70%)
- **Failed**: 3 (30%)
- **Execution Time**: 28.91 seconds

### Failed Tests
1. **test_1_websocket_events_staging**: `asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`
2. **test_2_message_flow_staging**: `asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`
3. **test_3_agent_pipeline_staging**: `asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`

### Passing Tests
- test_4_agent_orchestration_staging: All 6 tests passed
- test_5_response_streaming_staging: All 6 tests passed
- test_6_failure_recovery_staging: All 6 tests passed  
- test_7_startup_resilience_staging: All 6 tests passed
- test_8_lifecycle_events_staging: All 6 tests passed
- test_9_coordination_staging: All 6 tests passed
- test_10_critical_path_staging: All 6 tests passed

### Root Cause Analysis
The three failing tests all have the same error: "asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop". This suggests these tests are trying to create a new event loop when one is already running.

### Next Steps
1. Run full P1 critical test suite with pytest directly
2. Fix asyncio event loop issues in failing tests
3. Deploy fixes to staging
4. Re-run all tests
