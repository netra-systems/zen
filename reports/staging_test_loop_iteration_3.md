# Staging Test Loop - Iteration 3
**Date**: 2025-09-07
**Time**: 05:58:00 AM

## Summary
- **Iteration 1**: P1 Critical tests passed (25/25) ✅
- **Iteration 2**: Fixed WebSocketAuthTester import issue, deployed to staging ✅
- **Iteration 3**: New issue discovered - DatabaseURLBuilder attribute error

## Current Test Status

### Successful Tests
- **P1 Critical Tests**: 25/25 passed ✅
- **Priority Tests (P2-P6)**: 70 passed ✅
- **Staging Tests**: 58 passed ✅

### New Issue Discovered
**Error**: `AttributeError: 'DatabaseURLBuilder' object has no attribute 'postgres_host'`
**Location**: `shared/database_url_builder.py` line 269
**Impact**: Blocking real agent pipeline tests from running

## Deployment Status
✅ All services successfully deployed to staging:
- Backend: Deployed successfully
- Auth: Deployed successfully  
- Frontend: Deployed successfully

## Five Whys Analysis
1. **Why are tests failing?** - AttributeError for postgres_host
2. **Why is postgres_host missing?** - DatabaseURLBuilder doesn't have this attribute
3. **Why doesn't it have the attribute?** - Likely incorrect attribute access or missing initialization
4. **Why wasn't this caught earlier?** - The code path may not have been tested locally
5. **Why not tested locally?** - Different environment configuration between local and test

## Next Steps
1. Fix DatabaseURLBuilder attribute issue
2. Re-run tests
3. Continue loop until all 466 tests pass

## Progress Tracking
- Total test target: 466 tests
- Tests passing so far: ~153 tests
- Remaining to verify: ~313 tests
