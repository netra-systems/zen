- Ensures data integrity across WebSocket boundaries

### 12. Agent WebSocket Bridge Timeout Handling and Circuit Breaker âœ…
**Business Value**: Ensures bridge gracefully handles timeouts and prevents cascade failures, maintaining system stability under adverse conditions.
- Tests rapid event generation (20 events in rapid succession)
- Validates timeout handling and circuit breaker behavior
- Ensures system stability under stress

### 13. Agent WebSocket Bridge Authentication and User Authorization âœ…
**Business Value**: Ensures agent events are only delivered to authorized users, protecting sensitive AI insights and maintaining user privacy.
- Tests multi-user authorization scenarios
- Validates proper user isolation and security
- Ensures sensitive data protection

## Key Features
