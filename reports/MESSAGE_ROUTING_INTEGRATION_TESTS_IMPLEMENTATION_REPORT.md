‚úÖ **Integration Focus:** Tests actual integration points without Docker dependency  
‚úÖ **Business Value Focus:** Each test includes comprehensive Business Value Justification  

### **Test Framework Integration**
- **Base Class:** `BaseIntegrationTest` (SSOT compliance)

- `agent_thinking` - Real-time reasoning visibility  
- `tool_executing` - Transparent problem-solving approach
- `tool_completed` - Actionable insights delivery
- `agent_completed` - Complete value delivery notification

### **3. Production Reliability Assurance**
**Error Handling & Recovery:** Comprehensive error scenario testing ensures:
- Graceful degradation instead of system crashes
- Error isolation prevents cascade failures
- User experience maintained during partial failures
- Production deployment confidence

### **4. Development Velocity Enhancement**
**Regression Prevention:** 110+ integration tests provide:
- Comprehensive coverage of message routing architecture
- Early detection of breaking changes
