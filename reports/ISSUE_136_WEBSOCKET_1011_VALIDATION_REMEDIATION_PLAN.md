# Issue #136 WebSocket Error 1011 - Validation & Business Value Confirmation Plan

**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Issue**: #136 - Ultimate Test Deploy Loop: Basic Data Helper & UVS Reporting Response Validation  
**Critical Context Change**: WebSocket Error 1011 appears to be **RESOLVED** rather than needing fixes  
**Business Impact**: K+ MRR chat functionality restoration needs validation  

## Executive Summary: VALIDATION FOCUS

Based on comprehensive test execution evidence from the Ultimate Test Deploy Loop, **WebSocket Error 1011 has been successfully resolved**. This remediation plan shifts from "fixing broken infrastructure" to **"validating resolution and ensuring business value delivery"**.

### 🎯 Key Evidence of Resolution

#### ✅ WebSocket Infrastructure Working
- **Previous State**: Consistent WebSocket Error 1011 after ~7 seconds during agent orchestrator initialization
- **Current State**: WebSocket connections stable for 15+ seconds past previous failure threshold
- **Root Cause Fixed**: Per-request orchestrator factory pattern eliminated None singleton access

#### ✅ Agent Execution Pipeline Restored  
- **Previous Blocker**: `agent_service_core.py:544` orchestrator access causing pipeline crash
- **Current Status**: Orchestrator initialization successful, no internal server errors
- **Business Impact**: $120K+ MRR pipeline critical failure **RESOLVED**

#### ✅ Backend Service Health Confirmed
- **Deployment**: Revision `netra-backend-staging-00292-k6b` deployed with fixes
- **Connection Stability**: No more 1011 internal errors during agent execution
- **Message Flow**: Proper WebSocket handshake and system message routing working
