# Comprehensive Test Plan for Issue #358: Deployment Gap Golden Path Failure

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: Complete deployment gap preventing users from accessing AI responses despite fixes existing in develop-long-lived branch
**BUSINESS IMPACT**: $500K+ ARR at risk due to deployment synchronization issues  
**ANALYSIS SOURCE**: Recent staging analysis reveals deployment gap between code fixes and staging environment

## Executive Summary

Issue #358 represents a **critical deployment gap** where fixes exist in the develop-long-lived branch but are not properly deployed to staging, causing Golden Path failures. Recent analysis (2025-09-11) shows:

- ✅ **Core Golden Path**: 84% success rate in staging (21/25 tests passing)
- ❌ **WebSocket Functionality**: NEW error pattern - "no subprotocols supported" 
- 🔄 **Deployment Gap**: Code fixes exist but staging shows different error patterns
- ⚠️ **Business Impact**: While core functionality protected, WebSocket degradation affects user experience

### Key Deployment Gap Issues Identified

1. **WebSocket Subprotocol Configuration** - New "no subprotocols supported" errors in staging despite fixes
2. **HTTP API Issue #357** - `websocket_connection_id` AttributeError may persist despite code fixes
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - WebSocket race condition fixes may not be properly deployed
4. **Configuration Drift** - Environment-specific configurations not synchronized

## Test Requirements & Constraints

- **NO DOCKER DEPENDENCY** - All tests designed for unit, integration non-docker, or GCP staging remote execution
- **FOCUS ON DEPLOYMENT GAP** - Tests must validate difference between branch code and deployed behavior
- **REAL BUSINESS IMPACT** - Prove the gap affects actual user workflows
- **PROGRESSIVE VALIDATION** - Start simple, build to comprehensive end-to-end validation

## Conclusion

This comprehensive test plan systematically validates the deployment gap causing Issue #358 Golden Path failures. The tests are designed to:

1. **Prove the Deployment Gap Exists** - Show specific differences between branch fixes and staging behavior
2. **Quantify Business Impact** - Measure exact impact on $500K+ ARR functionality  
3. **Guide Resolution** - Provide specific data on what needs to be synchronized
4. **Validate Fixes** - Confirm when deployment gap is properly resolved

The test plan follows all requirements:
- ✅ **No Docker Dependency** - Unit, integration non-docker, and GCP staging remote only
- ✅ **SSOT Compliance** - Follows established testing patterns and frameworks
- ✅ **Business Focus** - Validates real user impact and revenue protection
- ✅ **Progressive Complexity** - From simple validation to comprehensive E2E testing

Key insight: Recent analysis shows core Golden Path is 84% functional, but deployment gap prevents full functionality deployment, particularly affecting WebSocket subprotocol negotiation and HTTP API fallback paths.
