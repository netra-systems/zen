# GitHub Actions E2E Test Results and Fixes

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Successfully Completed
1. **Identified top 5 critical E2E tests**
   - WebSocket agent events suite (32/34 passing)
   - User journey tests
   - Auth flow tests
   - Real services E2E core
   - WebSocket bridge functionality

2. **Fixed GitHub Actions configuration**
   - Updated all jobs to use `warp-custom-test` runner
   - Replaced manual service startup with Docker Compose
   - Added proper health checks and wait conditions
   - Fixed environment variables for test connections

3. **Created helper workflows and scripts**
   - `.github/workflows/e2e-docker-fix.yml` - Standalone E2E test workflow
   - `scripts/ci_docker_setup.sh` - CI Docker setup helper script

### üî¥ Current Issues

1. **Docker Hub Rate Limit**
   - Error: "You have reached your unauthenticated pull rate limit"
   - This affects pulling ClickHouse and other Docker images
   - Solution: Need Docker Hub authentication in CI environment

2. **Test Failures**
   - 2 WebSocket performance tests fail due to mock limitations
   - Unit tests showing failures (need investigation)

## GitHub Actions Workflow Changes

### Before (Problems)
```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Wrong runner
services:               # GitHub Actions services instead of Docker Compose
  postgres:
    image: postgres:17-alpine
# Manual service startup
python netra_backend/app/main.py &
```

### After (Fixed)
```yaml
runs-on: warp-custom-test  # Correct Warp runner
# Docker Compose for all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.alpine-test.yml up -d
# Proper health checks
for i in {1..30}; do
  if docker compose exec -T postgres pg_isready; then
    break
  fi
done
```

## Key Files Changed

1. **`.github/workflows/test.yml`**
   - All jobs now use `warp-custom-test` runner
   - E2E tests use Docker Compose with Alpine containers
   - Added comprehensive health checks
   - Fixed environment variables

2. **`.github/workflow-config.yml`**
   - Kept `warp-custom-test` as default runner (as requested)

## Next Steps for Full CI/CD Success

1. **Fix Docker Hub Rate Limit**
   ```yaml
   - name: Login to Docker Hub
     uses: docker/login-action@v3
     with:
       username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
       password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_TOKEN }}
   ```

2. **Add Docker Hub secrets to GitHub**
   - `DOCKER_USERNAME`
   - `DOCKER_TOKEN` (use access token, not password)

3. **Alternative: Use GitHub Container Registry**
   ```yaml
   - name: Login to GitHub Container Registry
     uses: docker/login-action@v3
     with:
       registry: ghcr.io
       username: ${{ github.actor }}
       password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

## Test Results Summary

### Local Test Results
- **WebSocket Agent Events**: 32/34 tests passing (94% pass rate)
  - Failures: Performance-related tests with mocks
- **E2E Tests**: Cannot run due to Docker rate limit
- **Unit Tests**: Some failures (need investigation)

### Expected CI Results
Once Docker authentication is added:
- E2E tests should work with proper service startup
- Health checks ensure services are ready
- Warp runner provides necessary resources

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test the workflow locally (if you have act installed)
act -W .github/workflows/e2e-docker-fix.yml

# Or push to a branch and monitor GitHub Actions
git add .
git commit -m "fix(ci): update E2E tests to use Docker Compose with Warp runner"
git push origin fix/e2e-github-actions

# Monitor in GitHub Actions UI
```

## Critical Success Factors

1. ‚úÖ Warp runner configuration (DONE)
2. ‚úÖ Docker Compose integration (DONE)
3. ‚úÖ Health checks and wait logic (DONE)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Docker Hub authentication (NEEDS SETUP)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix remaining test failures (IN PROGRESS)

## Recommendation

The E2E test infrastructure is now properly configured for GitHub Actions with the Warp runner. The main blocker is Docker Hub rate limiting. Once Docker authentication is added to the CI environment, the E2E tests should run successfully.

The 94% pass rate on WebSocket tests locally indicates the system is mostly working - the failures are performance-related edge cases that may not be critical for initial deployment.
