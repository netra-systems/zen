# Backend Service Deployment Audit Report

**Date:** September 1, 2025  
**Service:** netra-backend-staging  
**Project:** netra-staging  
**Region:** us-central1  

## Deployment Summary

‚úÖ **Successful Deployment:** Backend service was successfully built and deployed to Cloud Run  
‚ùå **Service Health:** Service is returning 503 (Service Unavailable)  
üîó **Service URL:** https://netra-backend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. WebSocket Event Delivery Failure (CRITICAL)
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Service startup blocked  

The service is failing during startup validation with a critical WebSocket event delivery issue:

```
CRITICAL | netra_backend.app.startup_module_deterministic:run_deterministic_startup:610 | 
Deterministic startup failed: CRITICAL STARTUP FAILURE: WebSocket test event failed to send - manager rejected message

WARNING | netra_backend.app.websocket_core.manager:send_to_thread:535 | 
No active connections found for thread startup_test_03d00f4c-cd84-445e-9088-32f14e8a692b
```

**Root Cause:** During startup validation (Phase 5), the WebSocket event verification test fails because there are no active WebSocket connections during the startup sequence. The startup module treats this as a critical failure and prevents the service from starting.

### 2. Post-Deployment Test Failures
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Authentication verification failed  

All post-deployment tests failed:
- ‚ùå Auth Service Health Check: Missing protocol in URL
- ‚ùå Backend Service Health Check: Missing protocol in URL  
- ‚ùå Token Generation: Async/await handling issue
- ‚ùå Cross-Service Auth: Missing protocol in URL

### 3. Configuration Warnings

#### Docker Credential Helper Warning
```
WARNING: Your config file at [C:\Users\antho\.docker\config.json] contains these credential helper entries
```
**Impact:** Low - This is informational only

## Service Configuration Details

### Cloud Run Configuration
- **Min Instances:** 1
- **Max Instances:** 20
- **CPU Throttling:** Disabled
- **Startup CPU Boost:** Enabled
- **VPC Connector:** staging-connector
- **Cloud SQL Instances:** 
  - netra-staging:us-central1:staging-shared-postgres
  - netra-staging:us-central1:netra-postgres

### Environment Variables
- `ENVIRONMENT`: staging
- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`: 1
- `AUTH_SERVICE_URL`: https://auth.staging.netrasystems.ai
- `FRONTEND_URL`: https://app.staging.netrasystems.ai

### Secrets Configuration
All 19 required secrets are properly configured in Secret Manager:
- ‚úÖ JWT secrets (jwt-secret-key-staging, jwt-secret-staging)
- ‚úÖ Database credentials (postgres-*)
- ‚úÖ Redis configuration
- ‚úÖ OAuth credentials
- ‚úÖ API keys (OpenAI, Gemini)
- ‚úÖ Service credentials

## Startup Sequence Analysis

The service follows a deterministic startup sequence:
1. **Phase 1:** Core Configuration ‚úÖ
2. **Phase 2:** Essential Services (Database, Redis, LLM) ‚úÖ
3. **Phase 3:** Chat Pipeline (WebSocket manager, Agent supervisor) ‚úÖ
4. **Phase 4:** Optional Services (ClickHouse, Monitoring) ‚úÖ
5. **Phase 5:** Validation ‚ùå **FAILS HERE**

The failure occurs at Step 18.5 during WebSocket event verification.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix WebSocket Startup Validation**
   - The startup validation should not require active WebSocket connections
   - Consider making the WebSocket event test optional or mock the connection during startup
   - File: `netra_backend/app/startup_module_deterministic.py:445`

2. **Fix Post-Deployment Tests**
   - Update test URLs to include proper protocols (https://)
   - Fix async/await handling in token generation test
   - File: `tests/post_deployment/test_auth_integration.py`

3. **Service Health Recovery**
   - The service is stuck in a restart loop due to startup validation failure
   - Once the WebSocket validation is fixed, the service should start normally

### Code Changes Needed

1. **startup_module_deterministic.py** - Make WebSocket validation non-critical:
   ```python
   # Line 445: Change from critical failure to warning
   try:
       await _verify_websocket_events()
   except Exception as e:
       logger.warning(f"WebSocket event verification skipped during startup: {e}")
       # Continue startup instead of failing
   ```

2. **test_auth_integration.py** - Fix URL construction:
   ```python
   # Add protocol to URLs
   auth_url = f"https://{auth_service_url}" if not auth_service_url.startswith("http") else auth_service_url
   ```

## Logs Summary

### Error Patterns Observed
- **WebSocket Manager Warnings:** 1 occurrence per startup attempt
- **Critical Startup Failures:** 100% of startup attempts
- **Container Exit Code 1:** Multiple occurrences
- **TCP Probe Failures:** Initial failures before service starts

### Service Restart History
The service has been attempting to restart continuously, with each attempt failing at the WebSocket validation step.

## Conclusion

The backend service deployment was technically successful, but the service cannot start due to a critical validation failure in the WebSocket event delivery system during startup. This is a code issue, not an infrastructure issue. The WebSocket validation logic needs to be updated to handle the startup scenario where no active connections exist yet.

**Status:** üî¥ Service Deployed but Not Operational

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix the WebSocket startup validation logic
2. Redeploy with the fix
3. Verify service health
4. Run post-deployment tests again
