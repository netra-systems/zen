# Fix: Issue #1021 - WebSocket Event Structure Validation

Closes #1021

## Summary

This PR resolves the WebSocket event structure validation issue that was causing message processing failures in the chat system. The fix implements proper event payload wrapping to ensure consistent message structure across all WebSocket communications.

## Business Impact

- **Critical Chat Functionality:** Ensures chat messages are properly processed and delivered to users
- **Revenue Protection:** Maintains stability of $500K+ ARR-dependent chat functionality
- **User Experience:** Eliminates WebSocket message structure errors that were breaking agent responses
- **System Reliability:** Prevents cascade failures in WebSocket event processing

## Technical Details

### Root Cause
WebSocket events were being sent without proper payload structure validation, causing downstream processing failures when agents expected wrapped message formats.

### Solution Implementation
1. **Event Payload Wrapper:** Implemented consistent event structure wrapping in WebSocket manager
2. **Structure Validation:** Added validation to ensure all events follow expected payload format
3. **Error Prevention:** Implemented safeguards against malformed event structures
4. **Backward Compatibility:** Maintained compatibility with existing event handling patterns

### Key Changes
- Enhanced WebSocket event structure validation
- Improved payload wrapping consistency
- Added comprehensive test coverage for event structure scenarios
- Implemented error handling for malformed events

## Validation & Testing

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
- **Integration Tests:** Created dedicated test suite for Issue #1021 event structure validation
- **Real Service Testing:** All tests use real WebSocket connections, no mocks
- **Error Scenario Coverage:** Tests cover both valid and invalid event structure scenarios
- **System Stability:** Validated that changes maintain overall system stability

### Test Results
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ New integration tests validate event structure handling
- ✅ WebSocket communication flows work correctly
- ✅ No regressions in chat functionality

### Files Modified
- WebSocket event handling logic (structure validation)
- Test infrastructure for event structure validation
- Integration test coverage for Issue #1021 scenarios

## System Stability Proof

This fix maintains complete system stability by:
1. **Non-Breaking Changes:** All modifications are additive and backward-compatible
2. **Isolated Scope:** Changes are contained to WebSocket event structure handling
3. **Comprehensive Testing:** Full test suite validation ensures no regressions
4. **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of edge cases and malformed events

## Post-Merge Actions

- [ ] Monitor WebSocket event processing in staging environment
- [ ] Verify chat functionality continues to work seamlessly
- [ ] Remove "actively-being-worked-on" label from Issue #1021
- [ ] Update system documentation if needed
