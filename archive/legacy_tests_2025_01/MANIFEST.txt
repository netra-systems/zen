# Legacy Test Directory Archive - January 2025

This archive contains legacy test directories that were moved on 2025-08-21 to clean up the test structure.

## Archived Directories

### 1. legacy_integration_tests/
- **Original Path:** ./legacy_integration_tests/
- **Reason for Archival:** Clearly legacy/duplicate test files (19 old test files)
- **Contents:** 16 Python test files including conftest.py
- **Key Files:**
  - conftest.py
  - test_agent_orchestration.py
  - test_app.py
  - test_auth_flow_comprehensive.py
  - test_e2e_dev_environment.py
  - test_e2e_staging_environment.py
  - test_error_recovery_resilience.py
  - test_generation_service.py
  - test_health.py
  - test_session_management.py
  - test_simple.py
  - test_supervisor.py
  - test_thread_lifecycle.py
  - test_websocket.py
  - test_websocket_realtime.py
  - test_websocket_simple.py

### 2. test_data/
- **Original Path:** ./test_data/
- **Reason for Archival:** Orphaned test data, duplicated by netra_backend/test_data
- **Contents:** Seed data files
- **Key Files:**
  - seed/basic_optimization.json
  - seed/complex_workflows.json
  - seed/edge_cases.json

### 3. test_snapshots/
- **Original Path:** ./test_snapshots/
- **Reason for Archival:** Empty directory, duplicate of netra_backend/test_snapshots
- **Contents:** Empty directory (removed)

### 4. ccusage_test/ (formerly ccusage/test/)
- **Original Path:** ./ccusage/test/
- **Reason for Archival:** Orphaned test directory
- **Contents:** Single test configuration file
- **Key Files:**
  - statusline-test.json

## Current Test Structure

After this archival, the main test directories are:
- **netra_backend/tests/**: Primary test suite with organized structure
- **tests/**: Additional test suite (not empty as initially thought)
- **frontend/**: Frontend test suite

## Notes

- The directories ./tests/agents/, ./tests/critical/, ./tests/deployment/, ./tests/integration/, and ./tests/websocket/ were NOT removed as they are not empty duplicates - they contain active test files.
- All moves were performed using `git mv` to preserve version control history where possible.
- The ccusage test file was not under version control, so it was copied rather than moved.

## Git Status

These changes should be committed as part of the test structure cleanup.
