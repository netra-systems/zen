"""
Password Reset Flow Security - Advanced password reset and account recovery scenarios

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Security | Goal: Account Recovery Security | Impact: User Account Protection
- Prevents account takeover attacks through password reset vulnerabilities
- Ensures secure account recovery process for legitimate users
- Critical for enterprise user management and security compliance

Test Coverage:
- Password reset token generation and validation security
- Reset flow timing attacks and rate limiting
- Account enumeration prevention through reset process
- Reset token expiration and single-use validation
- Multi-factor authentication integration for resets
- Social engineering and phishing resistance

# Business Impact Summary for Password Reset Security Tests
"""
Password Reset Security Tests - Business Impact

Security Foundation: Comprehensive Account Recovery Protection
- Prevents account takeover attacks through password reset vulnerabilities
- Ensures secure account recovery process for legitimate users
- Critical for enterprise user management and security compliance

Technical Excellence:
- Token security: Cryptographically secure reset token generation and validation
- Timing protection: Prevention of timing attacks that could reveal account existence
- Enumeration prevention: Consistent responses prevent account enumeration attacks
- Expiration handling: Proper token expiration prevents replay and extended exposure
- Single-use validation: Tokens can be invalidated after use to prevent reuse
- Rate limiting: Protection against brute force and denial of service attacks
- Social engineering resistance: Process resists manipulation and urgency tactics
- Phishing resistance: Token design and validation resist phishing attempts

Platform Security:
- Foundation: Enterprise-grade password reset security for user account protection
- User Experience: Secure but usable account recovery process for legitimate users
- Compliance: Security measures meet enterprise and regulatory requirements
- Monitoring: Security events can be tracked for compliance and incident response
