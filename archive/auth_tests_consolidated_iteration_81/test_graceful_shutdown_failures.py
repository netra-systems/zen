"""Test Auth Service Graceful Shutdown Failures
Tests that replicate shutdown timeout and socket closure issues.

CRITICAL SHUTDOWN ISSUES TO REPLICATE:
1. "Shutdown timeout exceeded" warnings during service termination
2. Socket closure errors during cleanup operations  
3. Connection pool not properly disposed during shutdown
4. Background tasks not properly cancelled during auth failures

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal  
- Business Goal: Ensure graceful service shutdown and resource cleanup
- Value Impact: Prevents resource leaks and improves service reliability
- Strategic Impact: Enables proper service lifecycle management in production
