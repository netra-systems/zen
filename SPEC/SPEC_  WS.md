SPEC:  WS Websockets

1:0: Primary Spec: WS Websockets Specification.
1:1:0: Goal: WS working frontend  and backend.


1:0:1: Frontend: CRITICAL: For each frontend concept, e.g. Context, Hooks, Store, etc. etc. MUST be only ONE single WS class or concept. ONE CENTRAL PLACE (for each) that all other components use and call etc. CRITICAL.

Careful:
1:0:1:0: Careful: Lanchain stream to JSON parsing
1:0:1:1: Careful: WS use JSON not string
1:0:1:2: Careful: Protect against multiple functions or processing double or triple wrapping JSON badly

1:0:1:3: Module imports: Check module imports and add tests for validating modules import

1:0:2:0: Frontend: WebSocket connection concepts.
1:0:2:1: WebSocket connection is established statefully on application state load (BEFORE the first message is sent.) It is an ERROR if WS canâ€™t be established.
1:0:2:2: WebSocket connection is persistent.
1:0:2:3: Important: WebSocket connection resilient to component re-renders and lifecycle changes.
Websockets works with regular JSON etc. when the user sends chat messages or free text or clicking examples etc.
1:0::2:4: WS messages are passed properly and use types.

1:0:2: Backend:
1:0:2:0: WS Startup profile: When application starts up or reloads, WS are available.
1:0:2:1: If the front end sends a socket but the backend rejects, it must be logged clearly. 
1:0:2:2: Backend sends responses using a single source of truth to manage WS. 
1:0:2:3: Backend: Always uses Schemas.py interfaces. 
1:0:2:4: Backend: Always complete JSON objects.
1:0:2:5: Backend: User Auth works with WS context
1:0:2:6: Backend: Dev Auth Auto login works with all relevant context

Remember: 0:7.  Remember: 0:1 to 0:7 to 1 including all sub items 1:0:0 through 1:2: etc.
