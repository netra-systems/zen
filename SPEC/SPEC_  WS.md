## SPEC:  UI/UX for chat & Artifacts & WS

1:0: Primary Goal WS working frontend  and backend.

1:0:0: Backend:  
1:0:0:0: WS Startup profile: When application starts up or reloads, WS are available.  
1:0:0:1: If the front end sends a socket but the backend rejects, it must be logged clearly.   
1:0:0:2: Backend sends responses using single source of truth to manage WS.   
1:0:0:3: Backend: Always uses [Schemas.py](http://Schemas.py) interfaces.   
1:0:0:4: Backend: Always complete JSON objects.  
1:0:0:5: Backend: User Auth works with WS context  
1:0:0:6: Backend: Dev Auth Auto login works with all relevant context

1:0:1: Frontend: Careful:  
1:0:1:0: Careful: Lanchain stream to JSON parsing  
1:0:1:1: Careful: WS use JSON not string  
1:0:1:2: Careful: Protect against multiple functions or processing double or triple wrapping JSON badly

1:0:2:0: Frontend: WebSocket connection concepts.  
1:0:2:1: WebSocket connection is established statefully on application state load (BEFORE the first message is sent.) It is an ERROR if WS canâ€™t be established.  
1:0:2:2: WebSocket connection is persistent.  
1:0:2:3: Important: WebSocket connection resilient to component re-renders and lifecycle changes.  
Websockets works with regular JSON etc. when the user sends chat messages or free text or clicking examples etc.  
1:0:2:4: WS messages are passed properly and use types.

Remember: 0:7.  Remember: 0:1 to 0:7 to 1 including all sub items 1:0:0 through 1:0:2.
