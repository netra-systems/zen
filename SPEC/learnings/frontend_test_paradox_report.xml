    <description>
      Despite having hundreds of frontend tests with apparent high coverage,
      the frontend remains extremely brittle for basic tasks. This report
      reveals the root causes: tests are not testing real functionality.

      <title>Tests Are Testing Their Own Mock Implementations</title>
      <evidence>
        - login-to-chat.test.tsx contains a complete mock LoginForm component (150+ lines)

  <root_causes>
    <cause>
      <title>Misunderstanding of Test Purpose</title>
      <description>
        Tests are being written to achieve coverage metrics rather than
        to validate real functionality. The focus is on quantity over quality.
      </description>
    </cause>
    <cause>
      <title>Fear of Real Integration Testing</title>
      <description>
        Developers mock everything to avoid dealing with complex async behavior,
        WebSocket connections, and state management. This creates tests that
        always pass but test nothing real.
      </description>
    </cause>
    <cause>
      <title>Test-Code Quality Double Standard</title>
      <description>
        While production code has strict 300/8 line limits, test code
        violates these principles freely, leading to unmaintainable tests.

      <title>Implement Testing Pyramid Properly</title>
      <description>
        - Unit tests: Test individual functions with minimal mocking
        - Integration tests: Test real component interactions
        - E2E tests: Test complete user flows with real backend
      </description>
    </recommendation>
    <recommendation>
      <title>Enforce Test Quality Standards</title>
      <description>
        - Apply same 300/8 line limits to test files
        - Require code review for test modifications
        - Track test effectiveness, not just coverage
      </description>
    </recommendation>
    <recommendation>
      <title>Create Test Reliability Metrics</title>
      <description>
        - Track how often tests catch real bugs
        - Monitor test flakiness
        - Measure time between bug introduction and detection

        Brittle frontend leads to frustrated users, abandoned sessions,
        and reduced conversion rates. Real bugs slip through fake tests.

        False confidence from passing tests leads to more production bugs,

        Unmaintainable test suite becomes a burden rather than safety net.
        Tests need constant modification to keep passing.

  <conclusion>
    The paradox is resolved: The frontend has many tests but remains brittle
    because the tests are not testing real functionality. They test mocks,
    validate their own implementations, and avoid real integration scenarios.
    This creates an illusion of safety while providing no actual protection
    against bugs. Immediate action is required to transform these fake tests
    into real quality gates.
