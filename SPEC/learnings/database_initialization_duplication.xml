    <problem>
        <description>
            Backend startup process was stuck in an infinite loop of database queries during initialization.
            The root cause was duplicate database initialization calls in the startup sequence.
        </description>
        
        <symptoms>
            - Backend startup hangs indefinitely
            - Multiple "SELECT 1" queries being executed repeatedly
            - Connection pool exhaustion warnings
            - High CPU usage during startup
            - Startup timeout errors
        </symptoms>
        
        <root_cause>
            In StartupManager._initialize_database(), both DatabaseInitializer.initialize_postgresql() 
            and setup_database_connections() were being called. The setup_database_connections() 
            function already calls initialize_postgres() and _ensure_database_tables_exist(), 
            causing duplicate initialization and potentially infinite loops of database queries.
        </root_cause>
        
        <impact>
            - Complete backend startup failure
            - Service unavailability
            - Connection pool exhaustion
            - Resource waste due to repeated queries
        </impact>
    </problem>
    
    <solution>
        <fix>
            Removed the duplicate call to DatabaseInitializer.initialize_postgresql() from 
            StartupManager._initialize_database(). Now only setup_database_connections() is 
            called, which handles all necessary database initialization in one place.
        </fix>
        
        <code_changes>
            <file>netra_backend/app/core/startup_manager.py</file>
            <change>
                Removed lines 591-593 that called:
                - db_initializer = DatabaseInitializer()
                - await db_initializer.initialize_postgresql()
                
                Kept only the call to setup_database_connections(app) which handles
                all database initialization including:
                - initialize_postgres()
                - _ensure_database_tables_exist()
            </change>
        </code_changes>
    </solution>
    
    <prevention>
        <testing>
            Created comprehensive test suite in test_database_initialization_duplication.py to:
            - Verify database is initialized only once during startup
            - Ensure test_connection_with_retry doesn't loop infinitely
            - Confirm _ensure_database_tables_exist is called exactly once
            - Validate all startup components are initialized exactly once
        </testing>
        
        <best_practices>
            1. Follow Single Source of Truth (SSOT) principle for initialization
            2. Each initialization step should have ONE canonical implementation
            3. Avoid multiple initialization paths for the same resource
            4. Use dependency tracking in startup manager to prevent duplicates
            5. Add explicit tests for initialization call counts
            6. Monitor connection pool metrics during startup
        </best_practices>
        
        <monitoring>
            - Track startup duration metrics
            - Monitor database connection pool utilization
            - Alert on excessive connection attempts
            - Log initialization step timings
        </monitoring>
