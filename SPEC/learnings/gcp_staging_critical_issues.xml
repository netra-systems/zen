  <title>GCP Staging Critical Issues - Authentication, Health Checks, and Static Assets</title>

  <priority>critical</priority>
  
  <summary>
    Critical analysis of three major categories of issues identified in GCP staging deployment logs:
    1. Complete backend authentication system failure (403 Forbidden errors)
    2. Health endpoint timeouts (503 errors with 5+ second delays)
    3. Static asset serving failures (404 errors for Next.js files)
    
    These issues prevent the staging environment from being usable for testing or demonstration purposes.

  <testing_approach>
    <principle>Create Failing Tests First</principle>
    <rationale>
      Created failing tests that replicate the exact issues observed in staging logs.
      These tests serve as:
      1. Documentation of the current problems
      2. Validation that fixes actually resolve the issues
      3. Regression prevention for future deployments
