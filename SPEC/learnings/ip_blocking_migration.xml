  <title>IP Blocking Migration to Load Balancer</title>
  
  <summary>
    Successfully migrated IP blocking functionality from application-level middleware to load balancer (Cloud Armor) for improved performance and security. This architectural change reduces application overhead and provides more sophisticated threat detection capabilities.
  </summary>

  <context>
    <situation>IP blocking was implemented at the application level in netra_backend through custom middleware</situation>
    <problem>Application-level IP blocking is less efficient and adds unnecessary middleware layers</problem>
    <solution>Migrate IP blocking to Cloud Armor at the load balancer level</solution>

      <title>Load Balancer is the Optimal Layer for IP Blocking</title>
      <description>
        IP blocking at the load balancer level (Cloud Armor) provides:
        - Better performance: Blocked requests never reach application instances
        - Advanced threat detection: Sophisticated rules beyond simple IP lists
        - Centralized management: Single point of control for security policies
        - Reduced application complexity: Fewer middleware layers to maintain

      <title>Middleware Can Be Cleanly Removed When Isolated</title>
      <description>
        The IP blocking middleware was well-isolated with:
        - No dependencies on other security features
        - No coupling with business logic
        - Separate from rate limiting and auth systems
        - Self-contained configuration
        This made removal straightforward with minimal regression risk.
      </description>
      <best_practice>Keep middleware components isolated and single-purpose for easier maintenance and migration</best_practice>
    </learning>

    <learning id="rate-limiting-independence" priority="medium">
      <title>Rate Limiting Should Be Independent from Static IP Blocking</title>
      <description>
        The security middleware's behavioral IP blocking (based on request patterns) is fundamentally different from static IP blocking:
        - Static IP blocking: Pre-configured list of banned IPs
        - Behavioral blocking: Dynamic blocking based on suspicious patterns
        These should remain separate concerns with different implementations.
      </description>
      <recommendation>Keep behavioral and static security measures in separate components</recommendation>

      <title>Security Migration Requires Coordinated Deployment</title>
      <description>
        When migrating security features between infrastructure layers:
        1. Ensure new security layer is fully configured and tested
        2. Monitor both layers during transition period
        3. Remove old implementation only after new layer is verified
        4. Keep rate limiting and other overlapping protections active during migration
