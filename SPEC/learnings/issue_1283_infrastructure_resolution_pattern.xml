    <summary>
        Issue #1283 demonstrated classic pattern of infrastructure issues being systematically resolved through architectural improvements, requiring closure rather than continued development work.
    </summary>

    <key_insights>
        <insight type="infrastructure">
            <description>Domain migration (Issue #1278) resolved SSL certificate and VPC connectivity issues that were root cause of staging deployment problems</description>
            <evidence>99% system health, operational Golden Path, enterprise readiness status</evidence>
        </insight>

        <insight type="architecture">
            <description>SSOT compliance achievement (98.7%) eliminated legacy pattern issues that caused configuration and integration problems</description>
            <evidence>WebSocket consolidation, unified mock factory, environment management standardization</evidence>
        </insight>

        <insight type="process">
            <description>Long-running issues require systematic verification against infrastructure changes before continued development</description>
            <evidence>Infrastructure work resolved underlying problems without code changes</evidence>

    <resolution_pattern>
        <step>1. Verify current system health and Golden Path functionality</step>
        <step>2. Cross-reference issue symptoms with recent infrastructure work</step>
        <step>3. Validate SSOT compliance eliminates legacy pattern issues</step>
        <step>4. Close resolved issues with comprehensive documentation</step>
        <step>5. Create learning documentation for future similar patterns</step>

        <segment>Platform (all customer tiers)</segment>

    <future_application>
        <criteria>Apply this pattern when issues exhibit:</criteria>
        <criterion>Long duration with infrastructure changes in same period</criterion>
        <criterion>System health indicators show operational status</criterion>
        <criterion>SSOT compliance eliminates legacy pattern causes</criterion>
        <criterion>Golden Path functionality operational</criterion>
    </future_application>

    <anti_patterns>
        <pattern>Continuing development work on infrastructure issues</pattern>
        <pattern>Ignoring systematic architectural improvements</pattern>
        <pattern>Failing to verify current state against issue descriptions</pattern>
