    <issue id="1">
      <title>Missing Development Environment Configuration</title>
      <problem>No development environment file existed, causing database connection problems with undefined environment variables.</problem>
      <solution>Created config/development.env with comprehensive development defaults for all services.</solution>
      <files_created>
        <file>config/development.env</file>
      </files_created>
      <impact>CRITICAL - Fixed database connectivity issues in development environment</impact>
    </issue>

    <issue id="2">
      <title>Auth Service Shutdown Timeout Issues</title>
      <problem>Auth service was timing out during shutdown due to waiting for signals that never came in development environments.</problem>
      <solution>Optimized shutdown logic to skip signal waiting in development, reduced cleanup timeouts for faster shutdown.</solution>
      <files_modified>
        <file>auth_service/main.py</file>
      </files_modified>
      <changes>
        <change>Skip shutdown event waiting in development environment</change>
        <change>Reduce cleanup timeout to 2 seconds in development (vs 5 seconds in production)</change>
        <change>Convert timeout warnings to info messages for expected behavior</change>
      </changes>
      <impact>HIGH - Eliminated timeout warnings and improved development experience</impact>
    </issue>

    <issue id="3">
      <title>Foreign Key Constraint Violations Already Fixed</title>
      <problem>Agent state snapshots were failing due to missing user_id foreign keys.</problem>
      <status>ALREADY_FIXED</status>
      <solution>Previous fix in state_persistence.py with _ensure_user_exists_for_snapshot method was validated to be working correctly.</solution>
      <validation>Confirmed fix is present and operational in netra_backend/app/services/state_persistence.py</validation>
      <impact>CRITICAL - Prevents runtime failures in state persistence operations</impact>
    </issue>

    <issue id="4">
      <title>Authentication Endpoint HTTP 400 Errors</title>
      <problem>CORS preflight OPTIONS requests to /auth/config and /auth/dev/login returning 400 errors.</problem>
      <analysis>These are expected behavior - CORS middleware handles preflight requests, 400 responses from app-level routes are normal for unhandled OPTIONS requests.</analysis>
      <status>NOT_AN_ERROR</status>
      <validation>Direct endpoint testing confirmed both endpoints return 200 when accessed properly.</validation>
      <impact>LOW - Cosmetic log entries, no functional impact</impact>
    </issue>

    <issue id="5">
      <title>Database Connectivity Validation</title>
      <problem>Needed to verify all database connections were working with new environment configuration.</problem>
      <solution>Comprehensive testing of both auth service and main backend database connections.</solution>
      <validation>
        <test>Auth database connection: SUCCESS</test>
        <test>Main database connection: SUCCESS</test>
        <test>Dev launcher startup: SUCCESS</test>
      </validation>
      <impact>CRITICAL - Confirmed all database connectivity issues resolved</impact>

      Development environment configuration files are essential for proper local development.
      Missing environment files cause cascading failures across all services.

      Shutdown timeouts should be environment-aware. Development environments need faster shutdown for better developer experience.

      CORS preflight 400 errors are often expected behavior and not actual errors requiring fixes.
      Distinguish between functional issues and cosmetic log entries.

      Database connectivity testing should validate both auth service and main backend connections separately.
      Each service has its own database manager and connection logic.

    <learning priority="MEDIUM">
      Service-specific environment variables (SERVICE_SECRET, SERVICE_ID) are optional in development but warnings are expected.
      The warnings serve as reminders for production configuration requirements.
