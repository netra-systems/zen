    <problem>
        <description>
            The agent workflow had illogical execution order where optimization agents were running 
            BEFORE data collection agents, attempting to generate strategies without analyzing actual data.
            This violated the fundamental dependency chain: gather data → analyze → optimize → plan → report.

        <symptoms>
            <symptom>Optimization agent executing before data agent in "sufficient data" workflow</symptom>
            <symptom>Data insights not available when optimization strategies are generated</symptom>
            <symptom>Actions agent working with incomplete optimization context</symptom>
            <symptom>Data helper agent positioned after optimization in "partial data" workflow</symptom>
        </symptoms>
        <root_cause>
            Workflow configuration had agents in wrong order, likely due to misunderstanding of 
            logical dependencies. The system was trying to optimize before understanding what data 
            was available, violating the principle "you can't optimize what you haven't measured."
        </root_cause>
    </problem>
    
    <solution>
        <description>
            Corrected agent execution order to follow logical dependency chain:
            1. Triage (assess) → 2. Data (measure) → 3. Optimize (analyze) → 4. Actions (plan) → 5. Report
            This ensures each agent has the necessary context from previous agents.

            <change file="netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/workflow_orchestrator.py">
                Fixed "sufficient_data" workflow: moved data agent BEFORE optimization agent
                Fixed "partial_data" workflow: moved data_helper immediately after triage
                Added explanatory comments about the logical ordering requirement

            <change file="SPEC/supervisor_adaptive_workflow.xml">
                Updated workflow configurations to reflect correct logical order

        <dependency_principle>
            Each agent depends on outputs from previous agents:
            - Optimization REQUIRES data insights to generate meaningful strategies
            - Actions REQUIRES optimization strategies to create implementation plans
            - Reporting REQUIRES all previous results to synthesize
            - Data Helper should run EARLY to identify gaps before processing
        </dependency_principle>
    </technical_details>
    
    <best_practices>
        <practice>Always follow logical dependency chain in agent orchestration</practice>
        <practice>Data collection and analysis must precede optimization decisions</practice>
        <practice>Helper agents should run early to identify missing requirements</practice>
        <practice>Document the purpose of each step in workflow configuration</practice>
        <practice>Validate that each agent has required inputs from dependencies</practice>

        <impact>
            Critical fix ensuring AI optimization recommendations are based on actual data analysis
            rather than blind optimization attempts. This directly affects:
            - Quality of optimization strategies (now based on real data)
            - Accuracy of implementation recommendations
            - User trust in system outputs
            - Overall value delivery of the AI optimization platform
        </impact>
        <affected_segments>All customer segments relying on data-driven optimization</affected_segments>
