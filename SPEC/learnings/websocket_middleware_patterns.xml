    <learning id="WS-001" severity="CRITICAL">
      <title>WebSocket Upgrade Detection Must Be Unified</title>
      <problem>
        Multiple implementations of WebSocket upgrade detection create security vulnerabilities.
        Different byte vs string handling approaches allow bypass attacks.
      </problem>
      <solution>
        Create single websocket_utils.py module with unified detection:
        - Always use byte-based handling for consistency
        - Single source of truth for upgrade detection
        - Shared across all middleware components
      </solution>
      <evidence>
        security_headers_middleware.py:45-77 vs middleware_setup.py:57-78
        Different implementations allowed potential security bypass
      </evidence>
      <prevention>
        - Code review must check for duplicate utility functions
        - Architecture compliance check must flag SSOT violations
        - Test suite must verify consistent behavior across middleware
      </prevention>
    </learning>

    <learning id="WS-002" severity="CRITICAL">
      <title>WebSocket Paths Must Be Excluded from HTTP Middleware</title>
      <problem>
        HTTP authentication and security middleware interfering with WebSocket upgrades.
        Auth middleware processing WebSocket paths as regular HTTP requests blocks upgrades.
      </problem>
      <solution>
        Explicitly exclude WebSocket paths from HTTP-only middleware:
        - Auth middleware: exclude /ws, /websocket, /ws/*
        - Security headers: skip processing for upgrade requests
        - CORS: separate handling for WebSocket vs HTTP
      </solution>
      <evidence>
        FastAPIAuthMiddleware missing WebSocket exclusions
        Security headers adding headers to WebSocket upgrade requests
      </evidence>
      <prevention>
        - Middleware setup must document WebSocket exclusions
        - Integration tests must verify WebSocket upgrade success
        - Middleware ordering must be deterministic and documented
      </prevention>
    </learning>

    <learning id="WS-003" severity="HIGH">
      <title>Multiple Origin Headers Are Security Vulnerability</title>
      <problem>
        Inconsistent handling of multiple Origin headers allows request smuggling.
        Development environment fallbacks mask security issues.
      </problem>
      <solution>
        Strict origin validation:
        - Reject ALL requests with multiple different Origin headers
        - No environment-specific security relaxation
        - Consistent validation across all environments
      </solution>
      <evidence>
        websocket_cors.py:354-378 allowed first origin in dev mode
        Could be exploited for unauthorized access
      </evidence>
      <prevention>
        - Security tests must include origin spoofing scenarios
        - Production-like security in development environment
        - Regular security audits of origin validation logic
      </prevention>
    </learning>

    <learning id="WS-004" severity="HIGH">
      <title>Middleware Ordering Creates Race Conditions</title>
      <problem>
        Non-deterministic middleware ordering allows timing attacks.
        Authentication exclusions configured after CORS setup.
      </problem>
      <solution>
        Atomic middleware configuration:
        - Single function configures all middleware in order
        - Document explicit ordering requirements
        - No dynamic middleware addition after startup
      </solution>
      <evidence>
        middleware_setup.py:36-40 vs 122-132
        CORS configured before auth exclusions
      </evidence>
      <prevention>
        - Middleware setup must be atomic operation
        - Startup sequence must be deterministic
        - Integration tests must verify middleware ordering
      </prevention>
    </learning>

    <learning id="WS-005" severity="HIGH">
      <title>Complex Classes Violate SRP and Hinder Testing</title>
      <problem>
        WebSocketCORSHandler handles CORS, security, metrics, and logging.
        556 lines with multiple responsibilities make testing impossible.
      </problem>
      <solution>
        Decompose into focused components:
        - WebSocketOriginValidator (validation only)
        - WebSocketSecurityPolicy (security rules)
        - WebSocketMetricsCollector (metrics only)
        Each < 200 lines with single responsibility
      </solution>
      <evidence>
        websocket_cors.py: 556 lines, 15 SSOT violations
        Functions exceeding 25-line guideline
      </evidence>
      <prevention>
        - Enforce module size limits (< 750 lines)
        - Enforce function size limits (< 25 lines)
        - Regular refactoring sprints to prevent accumulation
      </prevention>
    </learning>

    <learning id="WS-006" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Regex Compilation in Hot Path Kills Performance</title>
      <problem>
        Compiling regex patterns on every request causes 40% overhead.
        Origin patterns compiled during request processing.
      </problem>
      <solution>
        Pre-compile all patterns during initialization:
        - Compile patterns in __init__ method
        - Cache compiled patterns
        - Never compile during request handling
      </solution>
      <evidence>
        websocket_cors.py:93-105 compiles patterns per handler instance
        Causes measurable performance degradation
      </evidence>
      <prevention>
        - Performance profiling must check hot paths
        - Code review must flag runtime compilation
        - Load tests must validate performance requirements
      </prevention>
    </learning>

    <learning id="WS-007" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Memory Leaks from Unbounded Violation Tracking</title>
      <problem>
        Violation counts grow indefinitely without cleanup.
        Memory exhaustion possible under sustained attack.
      </problem>
      <solution>
        Implement TTL-based cleanup:
        - Use time-based eviction for violation counts
        - Set maximum dictionary size limits
        - Regular cleanup on background thread
      </solution>
      <evidence>
        websocket_cors.py:172-186 accumulates violations forever
        No cleanup mechanism implemented
      </evidence>
      <prevention>
        - All caches must have eviction policies
        - Memory profiling under load testing
        - Monitor memory usage in production
      </prevention>
    </learning>
