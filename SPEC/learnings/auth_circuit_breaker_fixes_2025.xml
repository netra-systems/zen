    <summary>
        Fixed critical auth service circuit breaker issues using multi-agent approach (QA, Implementation, Review agents).
        Addressed circuit breaker opening too aggressively, implemented proper fallback mechanisms, fixed async mocking 
        issues in tests, and improved WebSocket authentication resilience during service outages.

            <title>Circuit Breaker Opens Too Aggressively</title>
            <description>
                Auth service circuit breaker was opening after just 5 failures with 60-second recovery timeout,
                causing legitimate requests to be blocked for extended periods.
            </description>
            <solution>
                - Increased failure threshold from 5 to 8 failures
                - Reduced recovery timeout from 60s to 30s for faster recovery attempts
                - Added sliding window size of 15 with error rate threshold of 70%
                - Requires minimum 5 requests before circuit can open
                - Allows 5 test calls in half-open state (increased from 3)
            </solution>
            <files_modified>
                - netra_backend/app/clients/auth_client_cache.py (circuit config updated)

        </issue>
        
        <issue id="2" severity="critical">
            <title>No Fallback Mechanism for Auth Service Outages</title>
            <description>
                When circuit breaker opened, no fallback mechanism existed, causing complete authentication failure
                and blocking all user operations.
            </description>
            <solution>
                - Implemented cached token fallback using existing AuthTokenCache
                - Added emergency test token validation for development/test environments
                - Enhanced error handling to always try fallback before failing
                - Added proper logging for fallback usage tracking
                - Test token pattern recognition for graceful test environment degradation
            </solution>
            <files_modified>
                - netra_backend/app/clients/auth_client_core.py (fallback logic added)

            <title>AsyncMock Configuration Issues in Tests</title>
            <description>
                Test mocking was incorrectly configured causing "object MagicMock can't be used in 'await' expression"
                errors when testing async operations with httpx.AsyncClient.
            </description>
            <solution>
                - Fixed AsyncMock setup to properly handle async context managers
                - Corrected httpx.AsyncClient mocking patterns
                - Added proper __aenter__ and __aexit__ mock configuration
                - Used AsyncMock for all async method calls instead of MagicMock
            </solution>
            <files_modified>
                - tests/e2e/test_auth_circuit_breaker_iteration_1.py (mock setup fixed)

            <title>Legacy Circuit Breaker Implementation</title>
            <description>
                Using legacy CircuitBreaker instead of UnifiedCircuitBreaker caused inconsistent
                failure handling and missing advanced features.
            </description>
            <solution>
                - Migrated from CircuitBreaker to UnifiedCircuitBreaker
                - Updated imports and configuration to use unified implementation
                - Ensured consistent state management across all circuit breaker instances
                - Added proper state enum usage (UnifiedCircuitBreakerState)
            </solution>
            <files_modified>
                - netra_backend/app/clients/auth_client_cache.py (circuit breaker type updated)
