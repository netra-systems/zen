  <problem>
    <description>
      A "minimal stub" file agent_execution_registry.py was created to satisfy startup validation checks,
      duplicating functionality that already existed in the SSOT UniversalRegistry/AgentRegistry pattern.
      This violates fundamental SSOT principles and creates dangerous precedent.
    </description>
    
    <root_cause>
      Instead of fixing the root issue (startup_validator and health_checks using wrong imports),
      a quick "stub" was created just to make tests pass. This is CHEATING ON TESTS = ABOMINATION.
    </root_cause>

    <anti_pattern_characteristics>
      - Created as "minimal implementation for startup validation"
      - Duplicates existing SSOT functionality
      - Exists solely to satisfy import errors
      - Has no real business value
      - Creates confusion about which registry to use
      - Violates "Search First, Create Second" principle

      <title>Violates SSOT Principle</title>
      <details>
        We already have UniversalRegistry[T] and AgentRegistry as SSOT.
        Creating duplicates means:
        - Multiple sources of truth
        - Confusion about which to use
        - Inconsistent behavior
        - Maintenance nightmare

      <title>Test Cheating</title>
      <details>
        Creating stub files to pass tests is CHEATING.
        Tests exist to validate the real system works.
        If tests fail, FIX THE REAL ISSUE, don't create fake code.
        This pattern undermines the entire testing philosophy.

      <title>Technical Debt Snowball</title>
      <details>
        One stub leads to more stubs.
        Other developers see this pattern and think it's acceptable.
        Soon the codebase is full of "minimal implementations" and stubs.
        The real system becomes impossible to understand.

    <reason priority="4">
      <title>Hides Real Problems</title>
      <details>
        The stub masked the real issue: startup_validator was looking for wrong module.
        By creating the stub, we hide architectural problems.
        The real fix was simple: update imports to use SSOT.

      <title>Wastes Resources</title>
      <details>
        Time spent creating, maintaining, debugging stub code.
        Context pollution in searches and navigation.
        Cognitive load understanding which version to use.
        All for zero business value.

  <correct_solution>
    <step number="1">
      Identify the SSOT implementation (UniversalRegistry/AgentRegistry)
    </step>
    <step number="2">
      Update all consumers to use SSOT imports:
      - startup_validator.py → use get_global_registry("agent")
      - health_checks.py → use get_global_registry("agent")
      - tests → use SSOT patterns
    </step>
    <step number="3">
      Remove the stub file completely
    </step>
    <step number="4">
      Document the pattern to prevent recurrence
    </step>
  </correct_solution>

  <prevention_guidelines>
    <guideline>
      NEVER create "minimal stub" implementations to pass tests
    </guideline>
    <guideline>
      ALWAYS search for existing implementations first (SSOT)
    </guideline>
    <guideline>
      If import fails, fix the import path, don't create new file
    </guideline>
    <guideline>
      Tests must validate real system, not stubs
    </guideline>
    <guideline>
      When seeing "minimal implementation" comment, it's a red flag
    </guideline>
    <guideline>
      Use UniversalRegistry[T] for all registry needs
    </guideline>

  <key_takeaway>
    Creating stub files to satisfy imports is NEVER acceptable.
    Fix the root cause (wrong imports), not the symptom (missing file).
    SSOT means ONE implementation, not "one plus minimal stubs".
    Tests validate the real system, not fake implementations.
