  <title>Test Consolidation Learnings</title>

  <summary>
    Successful consolidation of duplicate E2E test directories from tests/e2e/ and tests/unified/e2e/
    into a single organized structure at tests/e2e/. This eliminated duplication and created
    clear separation of concerns for different test types.
  </summary>

  <context>
    <problem>
      Two parallel E2E test directories existed with 359 total test files:
      - tests/e2e/ (96 files) - Infrastructure and performance testing
      - tests/unified/e2e/ (263 files) - User journeys and integration testing
      This duplication caused confusion, maintenance burden, and unclear test locations.
    </problem>
    
    <root_cause>
      The tests/unified/ directory was created as an attempt to consolidate testing but
      resulted in parallel structures instead of true consolidation.
    </root_cause>
  </context>

  <solution>
    <structure>
      Consolidated all E2E tests into organized subdirectories under tests/e2e/:
      - tests/e2e/journeys/ - Complete user flows, signup/login, chat journeys
      - tests/e2e/integration/ - Multi-service, auth, sessions, database consistency
      - tests/e2e/performance/ - Load testing, scaling, throughput
      - tests/e2e/resilience/ - Error recovery, websocket stability, disaster recovery
      - tests/e2e/helpers/ - Organized by category (auth, agent, websocket, etc.)
      - tests/e2e/fixtures/ - Test data and setup fixtures
    </structure>

    <migration_steps>
      1. Analyzed both directories to understand test purposes and categorization
      2. Created target directory structure with clear separation of concerns
      3. Migrated 26 user journey tests to tests/e2e/journeys/
      4. Migrated 106 integration tests to tests/e2e/integration/
      5. Consolidated 24 performance tests in tests/e2e/performance/
      6. Organized 29 resilience tests in tests/e2e/resilience/
      7. Reorganized helpers into category-specific subdirectories
      8. Archived tests/unified/ to test_framework/archived/unified/
      9. Created automated import fixing script at scripts/fix_e2e_test_imports.py
      10. Fixed all import statements to reflect new structure
    </migration_steps>

    <import_fixing>
      Created comprehensive Python script to automatically fix imports:
      - Handles multiple import patterns (from/import statements)
      - Maps old paths to new organized structure
      - Updates helper imports to category-specific paths
      - Fixes patch statement strings with old paths
      - Processes 546 files and updates imports automatically
    </import_fixing>
  </solution>

  <outcomes>
    <success>
      - Reduced test files from 359 to ~200 through deduplication
      - Clear test organization by purpose (journeys, integration, performance, resilience)
      - Improved test discovery and execution
      - Reduced maintenance burden
      - Better code reuse through organized helpers
      - Successful test collection after migration (922 tests collected)
    </success>

    <metrics>
      - Files migrated: 185 test files + 40 helper files + 8 fixture files
      - Duplicate files eliminated: ~150 files
      - Import issues fixed: 166 files updated
      - Test collection success: 922 tests now properly collected
      - Directory reduction: From 2 parallel structures to 1 organized structure
    </metrics>
  </outcomes>

  <best_practices>
    <principle>Single E2E Test Location</principle>
    <description>
      Maintain all E2E tests under tests/e2e/ with clear subdirectory organization.
      Never create parallel test structures that duplicate functionality.
    </description>

    <principle>Clear Test Categorization</principle>
    <description>
      Organize tests by their primary purpose:
      - journeys/ for complete user flows
      - integration/ for multi-service coordination
      - performance/ for load and scaling tests
      - resilience/ for error recovery and stability
    </description>

    <principle>Helper Organization</principle>
    <description>
      Organize test helpers by functional area (auth, agent, websocket, etc.)
      rather than having a single monolithic helpers directory.
    </description>

    <principle>Automated Import Management</principle>
    <description>
      When reorganizing test structures, always create automated scripts to fix
      imports rather than manual updates. The fix_e2e_test_imports.py script
      serves as a template for future reorganizations.
    </description>
  </best_practices>

  <prevention>
    <rule>No Parallel Test Structures</rule>
    <description>
      Never create parallel test directories (like tests/unified/) that duplicate
      the purpose of existing test locations. Always consolidate into the primary
      test structure.
    </description>

    <rule>Service-Specific vs E2E Tests</rule>
    <description>
      - Service-specific tests belong in service directories (netra_backend/tests/, auth_service/tests/)
      - E2E tests that span services belong in tests/e2e/
      - Never mix service-specific tests with E2E tests
    </description>

    <rule>Import Path Consistency</rule>
    <description>
      Always use absolute imports starting from the project root (tests.e2e.*)
      rather than relative imports to ensure consistency and prevent breakage
      during reorganization.
    </description>
  </prevention>

  <tools>
    <tool>scripts/fix_e2e_test_imports.py</tool>
    <description>
      Automated script for fixing imports after test reorganization.
      Handles multiple import patterns and can be extended for future migrations.
    </description>

    <tool>test_framework/archived/</tool>
    <description>
      Archive location for deprecated test structures. Always archive rather
      than delete to preserve history and enable rollback if needed.
