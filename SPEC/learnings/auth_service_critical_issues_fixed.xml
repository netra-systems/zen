    <summary>
        Fixed critical auth service issues that were causing staging failures:
        database configuration, SERVICE_ID shell expansion, shutdown timeouts, 
        and missing OAuth configuration. All issues are now resolved.

        <issue id="1" severity="critical">
            <title>Database "netra_staging" does not exist</title>
            <description>
                Auth service was trying to connect to database "netra_staging" 
                which doesn't exist in staging. The correct staging database 
                name is "postgres".
            </description>
            <solution>
                - Updated staging configuration to use POSTGRES_DB=postgres
                - Created .env.staging with correct database configuration
                - Fixed database URL construction in DatabaseURLBuilder
                - Added proper validation for staging database credentials
            </solution>
            <files_modified>
                - .env.staging (new)
                - shared/database_url_builder.py (validation enhanced)
            </files_modified>
        </issue>
        
        <issue id="2" severity="critical">
            <title>SERVICE_ID showing literal shell commands</title>
            <description>
                SERVICE_ID was showing literal values like "$(whoami)" instead 
                of executing shell commands. This caused service identification 
                failures in staging environments.
            </description>
            <solution>
                - Added shell command expansion to IsolatedEnvironment.get()
                - Implemented _expand_shell_commands() method to handle:
                  * $(command) patterns
                  * `command` patterns  
                  * ${VARIABLE} environment variable expansion
                - Added safety measures: timeout, pytest detection, disable flag
                - Proper error handling and fallback behavior
            </solution>
            <files_modified>
                - auth_service/auth_core/isolated_environment.py (enhanced)
            </files_modified>
        </issue>
        
        <issue id="3" severity="high">
            <title>Graceful shutdown timeout issues</title>
            <description>
                Auth service had inadequate shutdown timeout handling causing 
                unclean shutdowns in containerized environments like Cloud Run.
            </description>
            <solution>
                - Enhanced shutdown timeout handling in main.py lifespan
                - Added configurable SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS (default 8s)
                - Added configurable CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS (default 5s)
                - Improved error handling during shutdown process
                - Added better logging for shutdown phases
                - Exception handling for all cleanup operations
            </solution>
            <files_modified>
                - auth_service/main.py (shutdown logic enhanced)

        <issue id="4" severity="medium">
            <title>Missing OAUTH_HMAC_SECRET configuration</title>
            <description>
                OAUTH_HMAC_SECRET was not configured in staging, causing 
                warnings and potential security issues in OAuth flows.
            </description>
            <solution>
                - Added OAUTH_HMAC_SECRET to staging environment configuration
                - Secret is properly loaded by OAuthSecurityManager
                - Eliminates "Using generated HMAC secret" warnings
                - Ensures consistent OAuth security across deployments
            </solution>
            <files_modified>
                - .env.staging (OAuth config added)

            - Set proper SERVICE_ID with shell expansion if needed
            - Configure OAUTH_HMAC_SECRET for production security
            - Set appropriate shutdown and cleanup timeouts
