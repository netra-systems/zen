    <summary>
        Fixed critical dev launcher issues related to non-idempotent migrations, ClickHouse connection validation
        false negatives, and uncontrolled migration fallback behavior. These issues were causing startup failures
        and database inconsistencies.

    <root_causes>
        <cause id="1">
            <description>Non-idempotent migration operations</description>
            <detail>
                Migration scripts used DROP INDEX without IF EXISTS clauses, causing failures when the index 
                didn't exist. This violated database operation best practices and prevented migrations from 
                being safely re-run.
            </detail>
        </cause>
        <cause id="2">
            <description>ClickHouse validation misalignment</description>
            <detail>
                Connection validation couldn't distinguish between service health issues and configuration 
                problems, leading to false negatives where healthy containers were reported as unhealthy due 
                to authentication or configuration issues.
            </detail>
        </cause>
        <cause id="3">
            <description>Uncontrolled migration fallback</description>
            <detail>
                When migrations failed, the system would fall back to creating tables directly, bypassing 
                proper migration tracking and creating schema inconsistencies between alembic_version and 
                actual database state.

    <best_practices>
        <practice>
            <title>Always use idempotent database operations</title>
            <guideline>
                All DDL operations should use IF EXISTS/IF NOT EXISTS clauses to ensure migrations 
                can be safely re-run without errors. This is critical for development environments 
                where database state may vary.
            </guideline>
        </practice>
        <practice>
            <title>Distinguish between health and configuration issues</title>
            <guideline>
                Connection validation should clearly differentiate between:
                - Service unavailable (network/container issues)
                - Service healthy but misconfigured (auth/database issues)
                - Transient failures (temporary network issues)
                This allows for appropriate fallback behavior and clear user communication.
            </guideline>
        </practice>
        <practice>
            <title>Control fallback behavior explicitly</title>
            <guideline>
                Migration failures should be classified as recoverable or non-recoverable.
                Only recoverable errors should trigger fallback mechanisms. Non-recoverable 
                errors should fail fast to prevent schema corruption.
            </guideline>
        </practice>
        <practice>
            <title>Use Five Whys analysis for root cause identification</title>
            <guideline>
                When debugging startup issues, apply Five Whys methodology to drill down from 
                symptoms to root causes. Most errors are not what they first appear - they're 
                often configuration, regression, or context-specific issues.
