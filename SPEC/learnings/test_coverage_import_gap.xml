  <problem>
    <description>
      Tests failed to catch a critical import error (missing ExecutionContext) in the 
      TriageProcessor module that caused production failures. The triage agent would 
      fail at runtime with NameError when processing real requests.
    </description>
    
    <root_causes>
      <cause id="1">
        <title>No Direct Module Testing</title>
        <details>
          The TriageProcessor class in processing.py was NEVER directly imported or 
          tested. Tests only imported TriageSubAgent from agent.py, which imports 
          TriageProcessor internally but doesn't execute the problematic code paths.
        </details>
      </cause>
      
      <cause id="2">
        <title>Python Import Mechanics</title>
        <details>
          Python's import system allows class definitions with missing type annotations 
          to succeed at import time. The NameError only occurs when the method using 
          the missing type is actually executed.
        </details>
      </cause>
      
      <cause id="3">
        <title>Mock Overuse</title>
        <details>
          Tests extensively mock LLMManager and other dependencies, preventing the 
          actual execution of process_with_llm() method that would trigger the error.
          The mocking philosophy of "Mock: LLM service isolation" prevented discovering 
          runtime errors.
        </details>
      </cause>
      
      <cause id="4">
        <title>Missing Import Validation</title>
        <details>
          No test suite validates that all modules can be successfully imported.
          No smoke tests execute real agent flows end-to-end.
        </details>

  <key_insights>
    <insight>
      Tests were testing the "idea" of code working, not the actual execution paths.
    </insight>
    <insight>
      Mock isolation can hide critical runtime errors when mocks are too broad.
    </insight>
    <insight>
      Python's import system allows broken code to pass import checks if the 
      broken parts aren't executed during import.
    </insight>
    <insight>
      Every internal module needs at least one direct test that imports and 
      exercises its primary functionality.
