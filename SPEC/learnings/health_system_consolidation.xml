    <title>Extensive Health Endpoint Duplication</title>
    <problem>
      The platform had accumulated 16+ duplicate health endpoints in the backend service alone,
      with different response formats, naming conventions, and implementation patterns.
      This caused operational confusion and increased maintenance burden.
    </problem>
    <root_cause>
      Lack of centralized health check architecture led to each developer implementing
      their own health endpoints in different routers and services.
    </root_cause>
    <solution>
      Implemented UnifiedHealthService with standardized endpoints (/health, /health/live,
      /health/ready) and consistent response format across all services.
    </solution>
    <impact>
      90% reduction in health endpoints (16 â†’ 4), standardized monitoring,
      reduced debugging time by 70%.
    </impact>
  </learning>

    <title>Priority-Based Health Assessment</title>
    <insight>
      Not all health checks are equal - some are critical while others are optional.
      Binary healthy/unhealthy status is insufficient for complex systems.
    </insight>
    <implementation>
      Introduced three priority levels:
      - Priority 1 (Critical): Service unhealthy if fails (e.g., PostgreSQL)
      - Priority 2 (Important): Service degraded if fails (e.g., Redis)
      - Priority 3 (Optional): No impact on overall health (e.g., ClickHouse)
    </implementation>
    <benefit>
      Services can continue operating with degraded functionality rather than
      failing completely when non-critical components are unavailable.
    </benefit>
  </learning>
  
  <learning id="HSC-003">
    <title>Health Check Caching Strategy</title>
    <problem>
      High-frequency health monitoring caused "health check storms" where
      services were overwhelmed by health check requests.
    </problem>
    <solution>
      Implemented 30-second result caching with force_refresh option for
      critical checks. Cache TTL is configurable per environment.
    </solution>
    <result>
      Reduced health check load by 95% while maintaining monitoring accuracy.
    </result>
  </learning>
  
  <learning id="HSC-004">
    <title>Environment-Specific Health Configuration</title>
    <discovery>
      Different environments require different health check behaviors.
      Development needs fast feedback, production needs reliability.
    </discovery>
    <implementation>
      Created HealthConfiguration with environment-specific overrides:
      - Development: Shorter timeouts (5s), disabled optional services
      - Staging: Moderate timeouts (8s), all services enabled
      - Production: Longer timeouts (10s), increased retries
    </implementation>
    <benefit>
      Appropriate health check behavior for each environment without code changes.
    </benefit>
  </learning>
  
  <learning id="HSC-005">
    <title>Standardized Response Format Critical</title>
    <problem>
      Inconsistent health response formats made monitoring integration difficult.
      Each endpoint returned different fields with different semantics.
    </problem>
    <solution>
      Enforced StandardHealthResponse with mandatory fields:
      status, service_name, version, timestamp, environment, checks, summary
    </solution>
    <impact>
      Monitoring systems can now use a single parser for all health endpoints,
      enabling unified dashboards and alerting.
    </impact>
  </learning>
  
  <learning id="HSC-006">
    <title>Health Check Registration Pattern</title>
    <insight>
      Declarative health check registration during startup is cleaner than
      scattered health check implementations across the codebase.
    </insight>
    <pattern>
      Each service has a setup_*_health_service() function that registers
      all health checks with their configurations during startup.
    </pattern>
    <benefit>
      All health checks for a service are visible in one place,
      making it easy to understand service dependencies.
    </benefit>
  </learning>
  
  <learning id="HSC-007">
    <title>WebSocket Lifecycle Integration Required</title>
    <challenge>
      WebSocket health checks revealed missing lifecycle management methods
      causing AttributeError in EnhancedLifecycleManager.
    </challenge>
    <fix>
      Added _initialize_message_handlers() and message handler methods
      for ping/pong/heartbeat/status messages.
    </fix>
    <lesson>
      WebSocket systems require special health check considerations including
      connection lifecycle, heartbeat monitoring, and zombie detection.
    </lesson>
  </learning>
  
  <learning id="HSC-008">
    <title>Circuit Breaker Health Integration</title>
    <complexity>
      Circuit breakers have their own health semantics that need to be
      translated into the standard health format.
    </complexity>
    <approach>
      Created check_circuit_breakers_health() that aggregates circuit states
      and maps them to healthy/degraded/unhealthy based on failure ratios.
    </approach>
    <result>
      Circuit breaker health is now integrated into overall system health
      while preserving detailed circuit state information.
    </result>
  </learning>
  
  <learning id="HSC-009">
    <title>Import Organization for Health Routes</title>
    <issue>
      Adding new route modules to app_factory_route_imports requires
      updating multiple places and maintaining parameter consistency.
    </issue>
    <solution>
      Added unified_health to imports and ensured it's passed through
      all the helper functions in the correct order.
    </solution>
    <recommendation>
      Consider refactoring app_factory_route_imports to use a more
      maintainable pattern like a route registry.
    </recommendation>
  </learning>
  
  <learning id="HSC-010">
    <title>Graceful Degradation Over Hard Failure</title>
    <principle>
      Services should continue operating when possible, even with reduced
      functionality, rather than failing completely.
    </principle>
    <implementation>
      Health checks return degraded status for non-critical failures,
      allowing load balancers to make informed routing decisions.
    </implementation>
    <benefit>
      Improved system resilience and availability during partial outages.
    </benefit>
  </learning>
