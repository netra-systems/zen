  <problem>
    <description>
      E2E tests were "passing" but executing in 0.00 seconds, indicating they weren't 
      actually running. The STAGING_100_TESTS_REPORT.md showed 154/158 tests with 
      0-second execution times.
    </description>
    <symptoms>
      - All e2e tests showing [0.00s] execution time
      - Tests marked as PASSED despite not running
      - No actual network I/O or service connections
      - Authentication being bypassed
      - Async operations completing instantly
    </symptoms>
    <root_cause>
      Tests were being skipped, mocked, or had missing async/await handling,
      causing them to return immediately without executing actual test logic.
    </root_cause>
  </problem>
  
  <solution>
    <approach>
      Implement automatic hard failure for any e2e test executing in 0 seconds
      at multiple enforcement points.
    </approach>
    
    <implementation>
      <component name="unified_test_runner.py">
        <method>_validate_e2e_test_timing</method>
        <description>
          Parses pytest output for [0.00s] patterns and forces test failure
          if any 0-second executions are detected in e2e categories.

      <component name="staging_test_base.py">
        <method>track_test_timing decorator</method>
        <description>
          Measures actual execution time using time.perf_counter() and
          fails tests executing in under 0.01 seconds.

      <component name="CLAUDE.md">
        <description>
          Added explicit requirement that 0-second e2e tests are automatic
          hard failures to core project documentation.
        </description>
      </component>
    </implementation>
    
    <validation_rules>
      - E2E tests MUST take at least 0.01 seconds to execute
      - Tests under 0.1 seconds trigger a warning (suspiciously fast)
      - All e2e tests must connect to real services
      - All e2e tests must use real authentication (except auth tests themselves)
      - No mocking allowed in e2e tests
    </validation_rules>
  </solution>
  
  <lessons_learned>
    <lesson>
      Test execution time is a critical validation metric - tests that execute
      instantly are not actually testing anything.
    </lesson>
    <lesson>
      Multiple enforcement points are needed - both at test runner level and
      within test base classes.
    </lesson>
    <lesson>
      Clear failure messages with diagnostic information help developers
      understand why their tests are being rejected.
    </lesson>
  </lessons_learned>
  
  <prevention>
    <measure>
      Automatic detection in unified_test_runner.py prevents 0-second tests
      from being marked as passing.
    </measure>
    <measure>
      Base class decorator provides runtime validation at test execution level.
    </measure>
    <measure>
      Documentation in CLAUDE.md ensures developers understand the requirement.
    </measure>
  </prevention>
