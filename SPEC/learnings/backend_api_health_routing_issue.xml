    <title>Backend API Health Endpoint Routing Issue - Dual Path Support</title>
    <description>Health endpoints needed dual routing to support both /health and /api/health paths for monitoring systems</description>
    <category>routing</category>
    <issue>
        Health endpoints were only available at /health/* paths but monitoring systems expected /api/health/* paths to also work.
        This caused 404 errors that were converted to 401 by security middleware, creating false authentication failures in monitoring systems.
    </issue>
    <root_cause>
        Health router was mounted with only one prefix "/health" in app_factory_route_configs.py.
        The route configuration in _get_health_business_configs() only included:
        "health": (modules["health"].router, "/health", ["health"])
    </root_cause>
    <solution>
        Added dual routing configuration to support both paths:
        "health": (modules["health"].router, "/health", ["health"]),
        "health_api": (modules["health"].router, "/api/health", ["health"]),
        
        This allows the same health router to be accessible at both paths without duplicating implementation.
    </solution>
    <file_changes>
        - Modified: netra_backend/app/core/app_factory_route_configs.py
        - Added line: "health_api": (modules["health"].router, "/api/health", ["health"]),
    </file_changes>
    <verification>
        - Both /health and /api/health endpoints now return 200 status with identical health responses
        - Tests in test_api_health_endpoint_cycle_56.py now pass for core routing functionality
        - Backward compatibility maintained for existing /health usage

    <lessons_learned>
        1. Health endpoints should support both /health and /api/health paths for monitoring system compatibility
        2. Router mounting allows the same implementation to serve multiple paths efficiently
        3. Security middleware can convert 404 errors to 401, masking routing issues as authentication problems
        4. Minimal changes (single line addition) can resolve complex-seeming monitoring issues
