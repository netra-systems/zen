  <problem_statement>
    <description>
      WebSocket implementation lacked comprehensive error handling, robust testing, and resilience features.
      Key issues identified:
      - Limited error recovery in send_to_thread function
      - Missing network error handling (ConnectionResetError, BrokenPipeError)
      - No progressive failure response (circuit breaker pattern)
      - Insufficient test coverage for real-world scenarios
      - Missing stress tests for connection stability
      - No token refresh integration tests
      - Heartbeat manager lacked thread safety and resurrection logic
    </description>
    <business_impact>
      Poor WebSocket reliability directly impacts chat quality - users experience:
      - Lost messages during network issues
      - Disconnections without recovery
      - Failed agent responses not reaching users
      - Token expiry causing session drops
      This undermines the core value proposition of AI-powered interactions
    </business_impact>

  <validation_requirements>
    <critical>
      WebSocket is the infrastructure enabling Chat value delivery.
      ANY changes to WebSocket components MUST:
      1. Run all three test suites (bulletproof, stress, token_refresh)
      2. Verify no regression in event delivery
      3. Test with simulated network issues
      4. Validate memory usage under load
      5. Confirm heartbeat reliability
    </critical>
    
    <performance_targets>
      - Message delivery success rate: >95% even with network issues
      - Connection stability: >95% healthy after 30 minutes
      - Memory growth: <100MB for 500 connections
      - Token refresh latency: <100ms P99
      - Heartbeat detection: <90s for dead connections
      - Error recovery: Automatic with exponential backoff
    </performance_targets>
  </validation_requirements>

  <best_practices>
    <error_handling>
      - Always use specific exception types when possible
      - Implement progressive failure response (warn -> unhealthy -> disconnect)
      - Use circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures
      - Log at appropriate levels (debug for expected, warning for concerning, error for critical)
      - Provide graceful fallbacks for all operations
    </error_handling>
    
    <testing>
      - Test with realistic network conditions
      - Include stress tests for production-like loads
      - Validate edge cases (clock skew, orphaned resources)
      - Use mock objects for isolation but also test with real components
      - Track comprehensive metrics during tests
    </testing>
    
    <monitoring>
      - Track connection health metrics
      - Monitor message delivery success rates
      - Alert on circuit breaker activations
      - Track memory usage trends
      - Monitor heartbeat timeout rates
    </monitoring>
