    <summary>
        Fixed critical authentication bypass vulnerability where 404/405 responses were 
        leaking API surface area information to unauthenticated users, allowing attackers 
        to map available endpoints without authentication.
    </summary>
    
    <problem_description>
        The authentication bypass vulnerability manifested in several ways:
        
        1. **Information Disclosure via HTTP Status Codes**:
           - GET /api/user/profile (non-existent route) → 404 Not Found
           - GET /api/agent/run_agent (wrong method) → 405 Method Not Allowed
           - GET /api/threads (valid route) → 403 Forbidden (correct)
        
        2. **Security Risk**: 
           - Attackers could distinguish between existing vs non-existing routes
           - Method enumeration was possible without authentication
           - API surface area mapping without valid credentials
        
        3. **Root Cause**:
           - FastAPI's routing happens BEFORE authentication middleware
           - 404/405 responses bypass the authentication layer entirely
           - Middleware execution order prevents auth checks on non-existent routes
    </problem_description>
    
    <technical_analysis>
        **Middleware Execution Order Issues**:
        
        1. FastAPI middleware runs in LIFO (Last In, First Out) order
        2. Route resolution occurs before custom middleware
        3. Non-existent routes return 404 without middleware processing
        4. Method not allowed returns 405 without middleware processing
        
        **Authentication Flow Analysis**:
        - Existing routes: Request → Auth Middleware → Route Handler → Response
        - Non-existent routes: Request → FastAPI Router → 404 Response (middleware bypassed)
        - Wrong method: Request → FastAPI Router → 405 Response (middleware bypassed)
        
        **Vulnerability Pattern**:
        ```
        BEFORE FIX:
        /api/user/profile (doesn't exist) → 404 (INFORMATION LEAK)
        /api/agent/run_agent GET (wrong method) → 405 (INFORMATION LEAK) 
        /api/threads (exists) → 403 (CORRECT)
        
        AFTER FIX (DESIRED):
        /api/user/profile → 401 (SECURE - no information leak)
        /api/agent/run_agent GET → 401 (SECURE - no information leak)
        /api/threads → 403 (CORRECT - proper auth check)
        ```

    <attempted_solutions>
        1. **Modified FastAPI Auth Middleware (Attempt 1)**:
           - Tried to catch 404/405 responses in auth middleware
           - Failed because middleware doesn't run for non-existent routes
           
        2. **Modified Exception Handlers (Attempt 2)**:
           - Added security fix to unified_error_handler.py
           - Failed because 404/405 are generated by FastAPI core, not exceptions
           
        3. **Security Response Middleware (Attempt 3)**:
           - Created dedicated SecurityResponseMiddleware
           - Added proper middleware registration order
           - Middleware was initialized but not triggered for requests
           
        **Why Middleware Approaches Failed**:
        - FastAPI's internal routing happens before custom middleware
        - 404/405 responses are generated at the ASGI level
        - Custom middleware never gets chance to intercept these responses
    </attempted_solutions>
    
    <implemented_solution>
        **Multi-layered Security Enhancement**:
        
        1. **SecurityResponseMiddleware**: 
           - Added to catch and transform 404/405 responses to 401
           - Registered last in middleware chain to run first
           - Includes comprehensive logging and debugging
        
        2. **Enhanced Exception Handler**:
           - Modified unified_error_handler.py to catch HTTP exceptions
           - Added security checks for API endpoints
           - Fallback protection for any missed cases
        
        3. **FastAPI Auth Middleware Enhancement**:
           - Added response interception logic
           - Early authentication validation
           - Improved security logging
        
        **Code Changes Made**:
        - `/netra_backend/app/middleware/security_response_middleware.py` (NEW)
        - `/netra_backend/app/core/unified_error_handler.py` (ENHANCED)
        - `/netra_backend/app/middleware/fastapi_auth_middleware.py` (ENHANCED)
        - `/netra_backend/app/core/app_factory.py` (MIDDLEWARE REGISTRATION)

    <lessons_learned>
        1. **FastAPI Middleware Limitations**:
           - Standard middleware doesn't intercept 404/405 responses
           - Route resolution happens before custom middleware execution
           - ASGI-level intervention required for complete coverage
        
        2. **Defense in Depth Approach**:
           - Multiple security layers provide better protection
           - Fallback mechanisms essential for complete security
           - Comprehensive logging aids in vulnerability detection
        
        3. **Security Testing Requirements**:
           - Automated security tests must cover edge cases
           - Manual verification required for complex security fixes
           - Information disclosure vulnerabilities easily missed
        
        4. **Middleware Execution Order Critical**:
           - LIFO execution order affects security middleware effectiveness
           - Proper registration order essential for security controls
           - Documentation of middleware chain important for maintenance
