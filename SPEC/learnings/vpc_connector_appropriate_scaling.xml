    <problem>
        <description>
            VPC connector was over-provisioned for staging environment with min_instances=10,
            max_instances=100, and machine_type=e2-standard-8. This configuration was:
            1. Unnecessarily expensive (10 minimum instances = 80 vCPUs, 320GB RAM always running)
            2. Based on misunderstanding of VPC connector role (network bridge, not compute)
            3. Attempting to solve application-level issues with infrastructure scaling

        <symptoms>
            <symptom>High infrastructure costs for staging environment</symptom>
            <symptom>Database connection issues incorrectly attributed to VPC connector capacity</symptom>
            <symptom>Over-engineering infrastructure instead of fixing root causes</symptom>
        </symptoms>
    </problem>

    <root_cause>
        <analysis>
            VPC connectors are network bridges between Cloud Run services and VPC resources.
            They handle network routing, not compute workloads. Connection issues are typically
            caused by application-level problems (connection pooling, timeouts, retry logic)
            rather than VPC connector capacity.

    <solution>
        <implementation>
            Adjusted VPC connector scaling to appropriate levels for staging:
            - min_instances=1 (auto-scales as needed)
            - max_instances=10 (sufficient headroom for load testing)
            - machine_type=e2-small (2 vCPUs, 2GB RAM - adequate for network routing)
        </implementation>
        <rationale>
            <point>VPC connectors primarily route network traffic, not compute-intensive work</point>
            <point>Auto-scaling from 1 instance handles normal staging load efficiently</point>
            <point>Max of 10 instances provides headroom without excessive cost</point>
            <point>Smaller machine types are sufficient for network routing tasks</point>
        </rationale>
    </solution>

                Staging environments should use minimal resources with auto-scaling,
                not mirror production capacity

                VPC connectors handle network routing. Database connection issues are

                Start with minimum viable configuration and scale based on actual metrics,
