  <problem_statement>
        After fixing OAuth token persistence issues in code, need to deploy and verify
        the fixes work in staging environment. Also discovered redirect URI misconfiguration
        during deployment verification.
    </problem_statement>
  <deployment_process>
    <step number="1">
            Fixed token handling in frontend code:
            - Updated /chat page to extract tokens from URL parameters
            - Updated /auth/callback to handle both access and refresh tokens
            - Added logging for debugging
        </step>
    <step number="2">
            Added comprehensive logging to auth service:
            - Log OAuth callback reception
            - Log token exchange success/failure
            - Log JWT generation and redirect URLs
        </step>
    <step number="3">
            Created test suites:
            - Integration tests for OAuth token flow
            - Deployment tests for staging environment
            - Monitoring scripts for post-deployment verification
        </step>
    <step number="4">
            Deployed to staging using deploy_staging.py script:
            - Backend service deployed successfully
            - Frontend service deployed with token handling fixes
            - Auth service already running with correct code
        </step>
    <step number="5">
            Verified deployment through monitoring and testing
        </step>
  </deployment_process>

    <discovery type="configuration_issue">
            OAuth redirect URI is misconfigured in Google OAuth Console.
            Currently points to: https://app.staging.netrasystems.ai/auth/callback
            Should point to: https://auth.staging.netrasystems.ai/auth/callback
            The auth service is the correct handler for OAuth callbacks.
        </discovery>
    <discovery type="working_flow">
            Despite redirect URI issue, the OAuth initiation works correctly:
            - Auth service properly redirects to Google
            - Google OAuth page loads with correct client ID
            - Frontend pages now properly handle tokens if they receive them
        </discovery>
    <discovery type="deployment_insight">
            Deployment script must be run from project root, not from
            organized_root/deployment_configs directory, to find Dockerfiles correctly.

    <method name="Service Health Check">
            curl https://auth.staging.netrasystems.ai/auth/health

            gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND

  <key_learnings>
    <learning>
            Always verify OAuth redirect URIs match between code configuration
            and OAuth provider console settings. Mismatches cause auth failures.
        </learning>
    <learning>
            Frontend pages that might receive OAuth tokens via URL parameters
            must handle token extraction and storage, not just dedicated callback pages.
        </learning>
    <learning>
            Deployment verification should include:
            1. Service health checks
            2. Configuration validation
            3. Flow testing (even if partial)
            4. Log monitoring for errors
        </learning>
    <learning>
            Create monitoring scripts that can be run post-deployment to quickly
            identify configuration issues and verify fixes are working.
        </learning>
    <learning>
            When auth service redirects to frontend with tokens, the frontend
            page being redirected to must handle the tokens, not expect a
            separate callback page to handle them.
