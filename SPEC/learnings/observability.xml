        <problem>
            Supervisor and DeepAgent lacked comprehensive observability for:
            - LLM call tracking (heartbeat, input/output)
            - Inter-agent communication
            - TODO list and flow state management
            - Pipeline execution visibility
        </problem>
        
        <root_cause>
            Observability infrastructure existed but was not fully integrated into supervisor flow.
            Missing flow state tracking and TODO list visibility made debugging and monitoring difficult.
        </root_cause>
        
        <solution>
            1. Created comprehensive observability spec (SPEC/supervisor_observability.xml)
            2. Leveraged existing observability infrastructure:
               - HeartbeatLogger for LLM call tracking
               - DataLogger for input/output logging
               - SubAgentLogger for inter-agent communication
            3. Created new SupervisorFlowLogger for TODO and flow state tracking
            4. Integrated observability throughout supervisor components
        </solution>
        
        <implementation_details>
            - Created modular observability modules (all ≤300 lines):
              * observability_flow.py - Main flow logger
              * observability_integration.py - Component integration
              * observability_flow_builders.py - Data structure builders
              * observability_todo_tracker.py - TODO state management
            - All functions maintained ≤8 line limit
            - Used structured JSON logging at appropriate levels:
              * INFO: Heartbeat, flow state, TODO changes
              * DEBUG: Detailed input/output data
        </implementation_details>
        
        <testing_approach>
            - 41 comprehensive tests created
            - Unit tests verify individual logging methods
            - Integration tests validate end-to-end flow
            - Supervisor-specific heartbeat scenarios tested
            - Mock-based testing for isolation
        </testing_approach>
        
        <prevention>
            - Always include observability in initial design
            - Use existing observability mixins and infrastructure
            - Create structured logging with correlation IDs
            - Implement at appropriate log levels (INFO vs DEBUG)
            - Test observability points during development
        </prevention>
        
        <impact>
            - Complete visibility into supervisor operations
            - TODO list tracking for debugging
            - Flow state monitoring for performance analysis
            - Correlation ID tracking across all components
            - Machine-parsable JSON logs for dashboards
        </impact>
    </learning>
    
    <learning id="modular-observability-architecture">
        <problem>
            Observability code could easily exceed 300-line module limit if monolithic.
        </problem>
        
        <solution>
            Split observability into focused modules:
            - Core logger class (main functionality)
            - Data builders (JSON structure creation)
            - Helper functions (global access patterns)
            - Integration bridges (component connections)
        </solution>
        
        <best_practices>
            - Keep each observability aspect in separate module
            - Use composition over inheritance
            - Create helper functions for common patterns
            - Maintain backward compatibility when extending
        </best_practices>

    <learning id="correlation-id-tracking">
        <problem>
            Tracking requests across multiple agents and LLM calls was difficult without correlation.
        </problem>
        
        <solution>
            - Use consistent correlation_id throughout request lifecycle
            - Pass correlation_id to all logging methods
            - Include in all JSON log structures
            - Generate at request entry point
        </solution>
        
        <implementation>
            - correlation_id generated once per request
            - Passed through supervisor → agents → LLM calls
            - Included in all observability log entries
            - Enables request tracing across components
        </implementation>
