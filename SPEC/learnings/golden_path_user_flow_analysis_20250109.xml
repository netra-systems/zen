            <description>
                Cloud Run environments experience race conditions where message handling starts before WebSocket 
                handshake completion, causing "Need to call accept first" errors and 1011 connection failures.

            <recommended_solution>
                - Implement comprehensive handshake validation
                - Add connection state verification before message processing
                - Use retry logic with exponential backoff

            The 5 WebSocket events (agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, tool_completed, agent_completed)
            are not just technical requirements - they are core to the user experience that drives our business value.
            Missing these events directly impacts user perception of AI processing and can affect retention and conversion.
        </note>

        <note type="architecture">
            The Factory pattern implementation is working correctly and should be preserved. The user isolation
            achieved through ExecutionEngineFactory and WebSocketBridgeFactory is a key architectural success
            that enables reliable multi-user operations.
        </note>

        <note type="monitoring">
            WebSocket connection failures and race conditions should be monitored in real-time in production.
            GCP Error Reporting integration is already in place for error tracking, but specific race condition
            detection needs enhancement.

            The progressive delay implementation in Cloud Run environments adds necessary stability but may impact
