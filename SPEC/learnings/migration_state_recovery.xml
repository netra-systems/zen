    <title>Migration State Recovery System - Critical Issue Resolution</title>
    
    <problem>
        Critical database migration issue where databases have existing schema but no alembic_version table,
        causing startup failures and blocking system operation. This is the "last major blocker preventing
        full system operation" that prevents reliable deployments and cold starts.
    </problem>
    
    <root_cause>
        Mixed database states where:
        1. Database contains existing tables (schema exists)
        2. No alembic_version table (migration tracking missing)
        3. Standard migration tools fail because they expect either fresh database OR properly tracked migrations
        4. System startup fails when migration tracker cannot determine current state
    </root_cause>
    
    <solution>
        Comprehensive Migration State Recovery System with:
        1. State Detection: Analyze database to determine current migration state
        2. Recovery Strategies: Multiple approaches for different problematic states
        3. Graceful Handling: Error recovery without system crashes
        4. Integration: Works with existing MigrationTracker and DatabaseInitializer
        5. Operational Tools: Command-line diagnostic and recovery utilities
    </solution>
    
    <implementation>
        Core Components:
        
        1. MigrationStateAnalyzer (netra_backend/app/db/alembic_state_recovery.py):
        - analyze_migration_state(): Comprehensive state analysis
        - Detects existing schema, alembic_version table, missing tables
        - Determines appropriate recovery strategy
        
        2. AlembicStateRecovery (netra_backend/app/db/alembic_state_recovery.py):
        - initialize_alembic_version_for_existing_schema(): CRITICAL FIX
        - Creates alembic_version table and stamps with current head
        - Handles corrupted alembic_version table repair
        - Completes partial migrations
        
        3. MigrationStateManager (netra_backend/app/db/alembic_state_recovery.py):
        - ensure_healthy_migration_state(): Main entry point
        - Coordinates analysis and recovery
        - Provides comprehensive status reporting
        
        4. Integration with MigrationTracker:
        - Modified check_migrations() to call ensure_migration_state_healthy()
        - Automatic recovery before migration checks
        - Prevents startup failures from migration state issues
        
        5. Diagnostic Script (scripts/diagnose_migration_state.py):
        - Command-line tool for diagnosis and recovery
        - Interactive mode for step-by-step recovery
        - Status reporting and dry-run capabilities
    </implementation>
    
    <recovery_strategies>
        1. INITIALIZE_ALEMBIC_VERSION:
        - For existing schema without alembic_version table
        - Creates table and stamps with current head revision
        - Enables normal migration flow to resume
        
        2. COMPLETE_PARTIAL_MIGRATION:
        - For databases with alembic_version but missing tables
        - Runs migrations to completion
        
        3. REPAIR_CORRUPTED_ALEMBIC:
        - For corrupted alembic_version entries
        - Clears and re-stamps with correct revision
        
        4. NO_ACTION_NEEDED:
        - For healthy migration states
        - Normal operation continues
        
        5. NORMAL_MIGRATION:
        - For fresh databases
        - Standard migration path
    </recovery_strategies>
    
    <usage_scenarios>
        Automatic Recovery (Integrated):
        - MigrationTracker automatically calls recovery before migration checks
        - Transparent to application startup sequence
        - Prevents startup failures
        
        Manual Diagnosis:
        ```bash
        python scripts/diagnose_migration_state.py --diagnose
        ```
        
        Manual Recovery:
        ```bash
        python scripts/diagnose_migration_state.py --recover
        ```
        
        Interactive Mode:
        ```bash
        python scripts/diagnose_migration_state.py --interactive
        ```
        
        Status Reporting:
        ```bash
        python scripts/diagnose_migration_state.py --status
        ```
    </usage_scenarios>
    
    <testing>
        Comprehensive test coverage:
        
        1. Unit Tests (test_alembic_version_state_recovery.py):
        - State detection for various scenarios
        - Recovery operations with mocked databases
        - Error handling and graceful degradation
        
        2. Integration Tests (test_migration_state_recovery_integration.py):
        - End-to-end recovery workflows
        - Integration with MigrationTracker
        - Coordination with DatabaseInitializer
        - Startup failure prevention
        
        3. Existing Tests Enhanced:
        - test_idempotent_migration_handling.py covers coordination scenarios
        - Integration with existing migration infrastructure

        System Changes to Prevent Future Issues:
        1. MigrationTracker now includes recovery before migration checks
        2. Graceful error handling for all database connection issues
        3. Comprehensive state analysis before any migration operations
        4. Diagnostic tools for operational troubleshooting
        5. Documentation and learnings captured for future reference
