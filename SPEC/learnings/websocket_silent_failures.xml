    <date>2025-08-19</date>
    <issue>WebSocket connections appeared successful but authentication was hanging silently without error messages</issue>
    <impact>Major - Complete loss of real-time logging messages reaching backend</impact>
    <resolution>Added comprehensive error logging and proper error propagation</resolution>

      <title>ALL FAILURES MUST RAISE BY DEFAULT</title>
      <description>
                Silent failures are the worst kind of failures. Every error condition MUST:
                1. Log the error with full context
                2. Raise/throw the exception 
                3. Close connections with proper error codes
                4. Return meaningful error messages to clients
            </description>
      <example>
                # BAD - Silent failure
                try:
                    user = await get_user(user_id)
                except:
                    return None  # Silent failure!
                
                # GOOD - Explicit failure
                try:
                    user = await get_user(user_id)
                except Exception as e:
                    logger.error(f"Failed to get user {user_id}: {e}", exc_info=True)
                    await websocket.close(code=1008, reason=f"Authentication failed: {str(e)}")
                    raise

      <title>Authentication Must Be Loud</title>
      <description>
                Authentication failures are security-critical and must NEVER be silent:
                - Log every authentication attempt
                - Log token validation steps
                - Log user lookup attempts
                - Log database connection issues
                - Always close WebSocket with proper error code on auth failure

      <title>Discovery Process for Silent Failures</title>
      <steps>
                1. User reported "no logging messages getting to backend"
                2. Checked if WebSocket server was running (✓)
                3. Tested WebSocket connection establishment (✓)
                4. Found connection succeeded but no messages processed
                5. Added logging at each step of authentication
                6. Discovered auth was hanging at user database lookup
                7. Found no error was being raised or logged
                8. WebSocket stayed open but non-functional (worst case!)

      <title>WebSocket Connection States</title>
      <description>
                A WebSocket can be in multiple states that appear successful but are actually failed:
                - Connected but not authenticated
                - Authenticated but message loop not started
                - Message loop started but handler errors silently
                Each state transition MUST be logged and errors MUST propagate

    <title>WebSocket Silent Failure Prevention - Comprehensive Masterclass</title>
    <path>websocket_silent_failure_prevention_masterclass.xml</path>
    <description>
      This learning document has been superseded by a comprehensive masterclass that covers
      all 5 critical WebSocket failure points discovered through extensive remediation work.
      The masterclass includes detailed implementation patterns, testing strategies, monitoring
      approaches, and a complete prevention framework for WebSocket silent failures.
