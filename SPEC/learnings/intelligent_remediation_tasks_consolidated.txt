# Intelligent Docker Remediation - Security Specialist Agent Tasks

## Overview
This document consolidates all security specialist agent tasks deployed during intelligent Docker remediation for authentication issues.

## Auth Service Tasks (4 deployments)
- **Container**: netra-auth
- **Issue Pattern**: Authentication failures (401/403 errors)
- **Agent Type**: security_specialist
- **Average Success Rate**: 58% (7/12 commands successful)

### Common Task Sequence:
1. Verify auth_service status
2. Check JWT configuration  
3. Validate certificates
4. Update security middleware
5. Test authentication flow

## Backend Service Tasks (14 deployments)
- **Container**: netra-backend
- **Issue Pattern**: Authentication failures in API endpoints
- **Agent Type**: security_specialist
- **Average Success Rate**: 67% (28/42 commands successful)

### Common Task Sequence:
1. Check backend auth middleware
2. Verify JWT validation
3. Check auth service connectivity
4. Validate API authentication flow
5. Restart backend service if needed

## Performance Task
- **Container**: Multiple
- **Issue Type**: Performance optimization
- **Agent Type**: performance_specialist
- **Focus**: Response time and throughput optimization

## Key Learnings:
1. Container names must match docker-compose.dev.yml exactly
2. Service restart commands frequently fail without proper container naming
3. Log analysis commands have highest success rate
4. Backend auth issues more frequent than auth service issues
5. Security specialists deployed automatically on 401/403 detection

## Recommendations:
- Implement proper container name resolution
- Add health check validation before restart
- Create rollback mechanism for failed remediations
- Add JWT token refresh to prevent auth failures
- Implement circuit breaker for auth service
