        <problem>
            MessageHandlerService created via dependency injection was missing WebSocket manager,
            causing real-time agent events (started, thinking, tool_executing, completed) to be
            silently dropped. This resulted in users experiencing "blank screen" during AI processing
            with no indication of progress, directly impacting $500K+ ARR business value.
        </problem>
        
        <solution>
            Implemented WebSocket manager injection in all MessageHandlerService creation paths:
            dependencies.py, service_factory.py, and agent_service_core.py. Added graceful fallback
            when WebSocket manager unavailable and comprehensive testing to prevent regression.
        </solution>
        
        <business_value>
            Users now see real-time agent progress updates in ALL scenarios (REST API and WebSocket routes),
            not just direct WebSocket connections. Eliminates "blank screen" during AI processing,
            directly protecting core chat experience worth $500K+ ARR.

        <issue_description>
            WebSocket events were working correctly for direct WebSocket route handlers but failing
            silently when services were created through dependency injection (REST API routes,
            background tasks, etc.). This created inconsistent user experience where some users
            saw real-time updates while others saw blank screens.
        </issue_description>

        <technical_details>
            <root_cause>
                MessageHandlerService constructor accepts optional websocket_manager parameter,
                but dependency injection paths were not providing it, defaulting to None.
                This caused WebSocket events to be silently dropped without errors.
            </root_cause>

                <description>
                    Optional constructor parameters don't make dependencies truly optional
                    if the functionality they enable is critical for user experience.
                </description>
                <takeaway>
                    Always inject dependencies needed for core user-facing features,
                    even if they're technically optional for compilation.

                <description>
                    Standard unit tests didn't catch this issue because WebSocket events
                    were silently dropped without errors. The failure was behavioral, not exceptional.
                </description>
                <takeaway>
                    Test expected behaviors explicitly, not just absence of exceptions.
                    Validate that critical events are actually sent, not just that code runs.

                    Different service creation paths (DI vs direct instantiation) had

                </description>
                <takeaway>
                    Ensure all service creation mechanisms produce functionally equivalent

                <takeaway>
                    Monitor from the user's perspective, not just from the system's perspective.

    <conclusion>
        <summary>
            The WebSocket injection fix successfully resolves the critical issue of missing
            real-time agent events in dependency injection scenarios. By implementing consistent
            WebSocket manager injection across all MessageHandlerService creation paths with
            graceful fallback patterns, we ensure that all users receive real-time progress
            updates during AI processing, directly protecting $500K+ ARR business value.
