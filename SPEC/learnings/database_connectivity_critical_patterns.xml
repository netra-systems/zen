  <title>Database Connectivity Critical Patterns - Iteration 3 Persistent Issues</title>
  
  <executive_summary>
    Critical database connectivity issues persist in iteration 3, specifically the "netra_dev database does not exist" 
    error that causes cascade failures across the entire system. Service continues in degraded state without proper 
    health validation, user communication, or security safeguards. These patterns affect all customer tiers and 
    prevent reliable system operation.

      <title>Database "netra_dev" Does Not Exist Error</title>
      <description>
        Auth service attempts to connect to 'netra_dev' database that doesn't exist in development/staging 
        environments, causing authentication failures that cascade throughout the system.

  <lessons_learned>
    <lesson category="database_connectivity">
      Database connectivity validation must be integral to health checks, not an afterthought. 
      Services reporting "healthy" without validating critical dependencies create false confidence 
      and prevent proper failure detection and recovery.
    </lesson>
    
    <lesson category="graceful_degradation">
      Graceful degradation must be user-centric, not just technically functional. Users need clear 
      communication about service limitations, and monitoring systems need accurate service state information.
    </lesson>
    
    <lesson category="security">
      Database failures can create security vulnerabilities through information disclosure in error messages 
      and potential bypasses of security validations. Error handling must be security-conscious.
    </lesson>
    
    <lesson category="cross_service_impact">
      Authentication service database failures have system-wide impact. All dependent services must be 
      designed to handle auth service unavailability gracefully with proper user communication.
    </lesson>
    
    <lesson category="environment_differences">
      Development, staging, and production environments need different graceful degradation policies. 
      Development might allow degraded operation for debugging, but production should fail fast to prevent 
      customer impact.
