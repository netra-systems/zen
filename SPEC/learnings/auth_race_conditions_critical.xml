    <description>
      CRITICAL: Main chat interface failed to initialize for authenticated users after page refresh.
      The auth context had a race condition where JWT tokens in localStorage were not properly
      decoded to set user state, causing AuthGuard to block access to the chat interface.
      
      CHAT IS KING - This affected 90% of our value delivery channel.
    </description>
    
    <symptoms>
      <symptom>Empty main element despite valid authentication</symptom>
      <symptom>WebSocket connected successfully but UI didn't render</symptom>
      <symptom>Threads loaded but chat interface blocked</symptom>
      <symptom>User appeared logged out after page refresh</symptom>
    </symptoms>
    
    <root_cause>
      The auth context's fetchAuthConfig function had a flawed condition:
      if (storedToken !== currentToken) that prevented JWT decode when the token
      was already initialized in state from localStorage. This created a scenario
      where token existed but user state was never set.
    </root_cause>
  </problem>

  <solution>
    <fix location="frontend/auth/context.tsx:237">
      Always decode and set user state when a valid token exists, regardless
      of whether it's already in state. The JWT decode must happen unconditionally
      to ensure user state is properly initialized.
    </fix>
    
    <code_change>
      <before><![CDATA[
if (storedToken) {
  if (storedToken !== currentToken) {
    setToken(storedToken);
  }
  // Token decode was conditional - WRONG!
  try {
    const decodedUser = jwtDecode(storedToken) as User;
      ]]></before>
      <after><![CDATA[
if (storedToken) {
  if (storedToken !== currentToken) {
    setToken(storedToken);
  }
  // ALWAYS decode token to ensure user is set
  try {
    const decodedUser = jwtDecode(storedToken) as User;
      ]]></after>
    </code_change>
  </solution>

  <race_conditions_identified>
    <race_condition id="token_in_state_from_constructor">
      <description>
        Token initialized in useState() from localStorage creates a scenario where
        storedToken === currentToken, preventing user state initialization.
      </description>
      <frequency>100% on page refresh with existing auth</frequency>
      <impact>Complete chat initialization failure</impact>
    </race_condition>
    
    <race_condition id="multiple_token_sources">
      <description>
        Tokens can come from localStorage, OAuth callbacks, WebSocket events,
        and storage events from other tabs, creating complex timing issues.
      </description>
      <mitigation>Added storage event listener and proper state synchronization</mitigation>
    </race_condition>
    
    <race_condition id="unmount_during_auth">
      <description>
        Component unmounting during async auth operations can leave state inconsistent.
      </description>
      <mitigation>Added isMounted checks and proper cleanup handlers</mitigation>
    </race_condition>
    
    <race_condition id="token_refresh_loop">
      <description>
        Token refresh can create infinite loops if not properly throttled.
      </description>
      <mitigation>
        Added refresh cooldown (30s), max failure count (3), and same-token detection
      </mitigation>

    <metric name="auth_init_success_rate">
      Percentage of successful auth initializations with existing tokens

    <metric name="chat_render_time">
      Time from page load to MainChat component render

  <architectural_implications>
    <implication>
      Auth state must be treated as the single source of truth for access control.
      All protected components must check user state, not just token presence.
    </implication>
    <implication>
      Token and user state must be atomically updated to prevent inconsistencies.
      Consider using a state machine for auth transitions.
    </implication>
    <implication>
      Storage events from other tabs must be properly handled to maintain
      consistent auth state across the application.
    </implication>
  </architectural_implications>

  <business_impact>
    <metric name="user_retention">
      Failed chat initialization directly impacts user retention as users
      appear logged out and may abandon the platform.
    </metric>
    <metric name="value_delivery">
      Chat delivers 90% of platform value. Any failure here is catastrophic.
    </metric>
    <metric name="support_tickets">
      "Can't access chat" tickets would spike without this fix.

  <lessons_learned>
    <lesson priority="CRITICAL">
      CHAT IS KING - Any change affecting chat initialization must undergo
      extensive testing including page refresh scenarios.
    </lesson>
    <lesson priority="HIGH">
      Race conditions in initialization code are particularly dangerous as
      they may only manifest in production usage patterns.
    </lesson>
    <lesson priority="HIGH">
      Comprehensive edge case testing is essential for auth flows as browsers
      have different storage behaviors and security policies.
    </lesson>
    <lesson priority="MEDIUM">
      Enhanced logging with clear prefixes ([AUTH INIT]) is crucial for
      debugging initialization issues in production.
