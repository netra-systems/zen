    <summary>
        Key learnings from implementing unified SecretManagerBuilder and JWTConfigBuilder
        to consolidate 4 fragmented secret management implementations into a single
        canonical solution following the builder pattern.
    </summary>

        <title>Builder Pattern Success for Configuration Management</title>
        <insight>
            The builder pattern with lazy-loaded sub-builders (as demonstrated by
            RedisConfigurationBuilder) provides excellent composability and separation
            of concerns for configuration management. This pattern enables:
            - Environment-specific configuration without code duplication
            - Clean separation between connection, security, validation concerns
            - Intuitive API with method chaining
            - Easy testing through mockable sub-builders
        </insight>
        <impact>HIGH</impact>
        <recommendation>
            Use the builder pattern with sub-builders for all configuration domains
            requiring environment awareness and multiple configuration aspects.
        </recommendation>
    </learning>
    
    <learning id="config-002">
        <title>Secret Management Fragmentation Causes Operational Risk</title>
        <insight>
            Having 4 different secret manager implementations (1,385 lines total)
            creates significant operational risk:
            - Configuration drift between services causes authentication failures
            - Different interfaces require developers to learn multiple patterns
            - Debugging is complex with inconsistent error messages
            - Integration time increases from 30 minutes to 2-3 days
        </insight>
        <impact>CRITICAL</impact>
        <recommendation>
            Always maintain SSOT (Single Source of Truth) for configuration management.
            One canonical implementation per service boundary, with shared libraries
            in /shared/ directory for cross-service functionality.
        </recommendation>
    </learning>
    
    <learning id="config-003">
        <title>JWT Configuration Drift is a Critical Business Risk</title>
        <insight>
            JWT configuration inconsistencies between auth_service and netra_backend
            cause enterprise customer authentication failures. Different environment
            variable names (JWT_SECRET vs JWT_SECRET_KEY) and expiry settings lead
            to $12K MRR churn risk.
        </insight>
        <impact>CRITICAL</impact>
        <recommendation>
            Implement JWTConfigBuilder with standardized environment variable names
            and consistent configuration across all services. Include backward
            compatibility for legacy variable names during transition.
        </recommendation>
    </learning>
    
    <learning id="config-004">
        <title>Performance Must Be Benchmarked Early</title>
        <insight>
            The initial SecretManagerBuilder implementation was 300x slower than
            the existing solution (1.2s vs 0.004s) due to synchronous GCP calls
            and lack of caching. This performance regression would have caused
            production issues if deployed.
        </insight>
        <impact>HIGH</impact>
        <recommendation>
            Always benchmark performance against existing solutions before
            implementation. Target <100ms for configuration loading with
            intelligent caching and batch operations.
        </recommendation>
    </learning>
    
    <learning id="config-005">
        <title>Test Coverage is Essential for Configuration Code</title>
        <insight>
            0% test coverage for configuration code (2,075 lines) creates high risk.
            Configuration bugs are particularly dangerous because they affect system
            initialization and can prevent services from starting.
        </insight>
        <impact>HIGH</impact>
        <recommendation>
            Require minimum 80% test coverage for all configuration code.
            Include unit tests for builders, integration tests for service usage,
            and E2E tests for environment-specific behavior.
        </recommendation>
    </learning>
    
    <learning id="config-006">
        <title>Service Boundaries Must Be Respected in Configuration</title>
        <insight>
            Maintaining service independence between auth_service and netra_backend
            while providing unified configuration requires careful design. Using
            /shared/ directory for cross-service builders with service-specific
            adapters maintains boundaries while eliminating duplication.
        </insight>
        <impact>MEDIUM</impact>
        <recommendation>
            Place unified configuration builders in /shared/ directory.
            Each service maintains thin adapter layers that use the shared
            builders while preserving service-specific requirements.
        </recommendation>
    </learning>
    
    <learning id="config-007">
        <title>Multi-Agent Development Provides Comprehensive Analysis</title>
        <insight>
            Using 8 specialized agents (Search, Architecture, PM, Implementation,
            Review, Audit, QA) provided thorough analysis and caught issues that
            might have been missed by a single developer. Each agent's focused
            perspective added value to the final solution.
        </insight>
        <impact>HIGH</impact>
        <recommendation>
            Use multi-agent approach for complex system-wide changes. Allocate
            agents for: discovery, architecture, testing, implementation, review,
            audit, and QA to ensure comprehensive coverage.
        </recommendation>
    </learning>
    
    <learning id="config-008">
        <title>Legacy Code Removal Must Be Atomic</title>
        <insight>
            Leaving 1,381 lines of legacy secret management code while implementing
            new solution creates parallel implementations violating SSOT. This makes
            the system harder to maintain and debug.
        </insight>
        <impact>HIGH</impact>
        <recommendation>
            Legacy code removal must be atomic with new implementation. Use
            feature flags or backward compatibility wrappers to enable gradual
            migration while maintaining single implementation.
        </recommendation>
    </learning>
    
    <learning id="config-009">
        <title>Development Environment Configuration Requires Special Attention</title>
        <insight>
            Development environment has unique requirements: faster load times,
            placeholder values allowed, local file fallbacks. The SecretManagerBuilder's
            DevelopmentBuilder sub-builder pattern handles these elegantly.
        </insight>
        <impact>MEDIUM</impact>
        <recommendation>
            Always include environment-specific sub-builders (Development, Staging,
            Production) with appropriate security relaxation for development while
            maintaining strict validation for production.
        </recommendation>
    </learning>
    
    <learning id="config-010">
        <title>Configuration Validation Prevents Production Incidents</title>
        <insight>
            Placeholder detection, minimum secret length validation, and required
            secret checking prevent configuration errors from reaching production.
            These validations caught multiple issues during testing.
        </insight>
        <impact>HIGH</impact>
        <recommendation>
            Implement comprehensive validation in configuration builders:
            - No placeholder values in staging/production
            - Minimum secret lengths (32+ characters for keys)
            - Required secrets validation before service start
            - Clear error messages with remediation steps
        </recommendation>

            <name>Multiple Secret Manager Implementations</name>
            <description>
                Having different secret loading implementations per service
                violates SSOT and creates maintenance burden.
            </description>

            <description>
                GCP project IDs, timeouts, retry counts hardcoded throughout
                codebase make environment-specific configuration difficult.

                Different services using different names for same configuration
                (JWT_SECRET vs JWT_SECRET_KEY) causes drift.
            </description>
            <solution>
                Standardized variable names with backward compatibility during
                transition period.
