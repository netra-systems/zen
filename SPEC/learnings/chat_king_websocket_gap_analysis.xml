    <title>Chat is King - Critical WebSocket Event Gap Analysis</title>

  <executive_summary>
    <for_product_managers>
      Our core chat functionality is severely compromised. Users send messages but see no feedback while 
      AI agents process their requests. This creates a perception that the system is frozen or broken, 
      directly impacting user retention and conversion. The technical components exist but aren't connected.
      Fix time: 2-4 hours. Impact: Immediate restoration of user confidence and engagement.
    </for_product_managers>
    
    <for_engineers>
      The WebSocket event system is architecturally complete but disconnected from the actual chat message 
      processing flow. The MessageHandlerService creates supervisor instances without WebSocket integration, 
      causing users to experience no real-time feedback during agent execution. This is an integration gap, 
      not an architectural flaw - all components exist but aren't wired together in the execution path.

      <description>
        The supervisor execution happens in isolation from WebSocket notifications.
        MessageHandlerService creates supervisor instances without WebSocket integration.
      </description>
      <impact>
        Users see no real-time feedback during agent execution - chat appears broken.
        No agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, or agent_completed events sent.
      </impact>
      <root_cause>
        Message handler flow bypasses the WebSocket-enhanced supervisor components.
        supervisor._execute_supervisor() operates without WebSocket manager injection.
      </root_cause>

      <description>
        AgentMessageHandler routes to MessageHandlerService but WebSocketManager is never

      <flow_break>
        WebSocket Message → AgentMessageHandler → MessageHandlerService → Supervisor (NO WEBSOCKET)

        Mission-critical tests fail on real service integration, indicating the WebSocket

      <title>Event Flow Architectural Disconnection</title>
      <description>
        All WebSocket components exist and are properly implemented:
        - ✅ WebSocketNotifier with all 7 event types
        - ✅ EnhancedToolExecutionEngine with event sending  
        - ✅ ExecutionEngine with WebSocket integration
        - ✅ AgentRegistry enhancing tool dispatcher
        
        BUT: These components are not used in the actual chat message execution path.
      </description>
      <architectural_issue>
        The enhanced components exist in parallel to the actual execution flow rather than being integrated into it.

      4. MessageHandlerService creates standalone supervisor (NO WebSocket)
      5. Supervisor executes without WebSocket notifications
      6. User sees no real-time feedback - chat appears broken
      7. Response only sent at completion

  <business_impact>
    <user_experience>
      - Chat appears unresponsive during agent execution
      - Users don't know if their request is being processed
      - No visibility into agent progress or tool usage
      - Users may abandon requests thinking the system is broken
    </user_experience>
    
    <revenue_impact>
      - Free tier users won't convert if chat feels broken
      - Paid users will churn due to poor experience
      - Demo flows fail due to lack of real-time feedback
      - Support burden increases from "is it working?" questions

  <architectural_notes>
    <current_state>
      The WebSocket event architecture is well-designed and feature-complete.
      The AgentRegistry properly enhances tool dispatchers with WebSocket notifications.
      The ExecutionEngine properly sends agent lifecycle events.
      The problem is purely in the integration layer - the chat flow doesn't use these enhanced components.
    </current_state>
    
    <solution_approach>
      The fix is NOT about building new WebSocket functionality.
      The fix is about connecting the existing WebSocket-enhanced components to the actual chat message processing flow.
      This is an integration problem, not an architecture problem.
    </solution_approach>
  </architectural_notes>

  <regression_prevention>
    <rule>
      ANY changes to MessageHandlerService or AgentMessageHandler MUST:
      1. Verify WebSocket manager is properly injected
      2. Run mission-critical WebSocket event tests
      3. Test with real user chat scenarios
      4. Validate all 7 critical events are sent
    </rule>
    
    <monitoring>
      In production, monitor for:
      - Chat messages with no corresponding agent_started events
      - Agent executions without tool_executing/tool_completed pairs
      - Users sending multiple messages due to lack of feedback
      - High abandonment rates during agent processing
    </monitoring>
