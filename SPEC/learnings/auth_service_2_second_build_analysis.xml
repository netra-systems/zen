    <problem>
        Auth service builds in 2 seconds while backend/frontend take 30-60 seconds.
        Need to understand and replicate this performance across all services.

                Multi-stage build separates dependencies from application code.
                Builder stage compiles and installs all dependencies once.
                Runtime stage only copies pre-built packages.

                3. Application code (frequent changes)

                Smart COPY patterns:

                - Copy application code LAST
                This maximizes cache hit rate.

    <solution>
        <step number="1">
            Use multi-stage builds for ALL services.
            Builder stage handles compilation and dependencies.
            Runtime stage stays minimal.
        </step>
        
        <step number="2">
            Order COPY commands by change frequency:
            - Static files first (requirements.txt)
            - Dynamic files last (application code)
        </step>
        
        <step number="3">
            Switch to Alpine base images:
            - 50% smaller than debian-slim
            - Faster layer operations
            - Better security posture
        </step>
        
        <step number="4">
            Use BuildKit cache mounts for pip:
            --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip
            Persistent cache across builds.
        </step>
        
        <step number="5">
            Optimize .dockerignore:
            Exclude ALL test files, docs, scripts.
            Smaller build context = faster transfers.
        </step>

        - [ ] Multi-stage Dockerfile with builder pattern
        - [ ] Alpine base images (python:3.11-alpine3.19)
        - [ ] Requirements.txt copied and installed separately
        - [ ] Application code copied LAST
        - [ ] BuildKit cache mounts enabled
        - [ ] Optimized .dockerignore file
        - [ ] Non-root user in production stage
        - [ ] Tini for proper signal handling
