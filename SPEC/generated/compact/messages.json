PASS:  Missing Unified Events - IMPLEMENTED\n**Previous:** Frontend expected events that backend never sent\n**Fixed:** Added all missing events to supervisor_consolidated.py:\n- `agent_thinking` - Shows intermediate reasoning\n- `partial_result` - Streaming content updates  \n- `tool_executing` - Tool execution notifications\n- `final_report` - Complete analysis results",

PASS:  Duplicate WebSocket Systems - REMOVED\n**Previous:** Two competing WebSocket systems in frontend\n**Fixed:** Consolidated to unified-chat.ts only\n- Simplified useChatWebSocket.ts to route all events to unified store\n- Removed legacy event handling logic\n- Maintained backward compatibility through adapter pattern",
    "### 5.  PASS:  Event Name Misalignment - ALIGNED\n**Previous:** Backend sent \"agent_finished\", frontend expected \"agent_completed\"\n**Fixed:** Changed all backend events to use \"agent_completed\"",
    "### 6.  PASS:  Layer Data Accumulation Bug - FIXED\n**Previous:** Duplicate content in medium layer\n**Fixed:** Improved deduplication logic:\n- Check for complete replacement flag\n- Detect if new content contains old\n- Only append when truly incremental",
    "### 7.  PASS:  Thread Management Events - ADDED\n**Previous:** Missing thread lifecycle events\n**Fixed:** Added events to thread_service.py:\n- `thread_created` - When new thread is created\n- `agent_started` - When run begins",
