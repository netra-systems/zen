Justify any new mocks with comments\n\n### When Tests Fail\n1. Identify if it's a test issue or system issue\n2. Fix root cause, not just the test\n3. Update test if requirements changed\n4. Document learning in SPEC/learnings/\n\n### When Refactoring\n1. Ensure tests still cover all scenarios\n2. Update test descriptions if behavior changed\n3. Maintain test organization and clarity\n4.

Complete registration flow integration with real database persistence\n2. Business email detection integration with external service calls  \n3. Trial period calculation integration with environment-specific rules\n4. Login attempt lockout integration with Redis-backed concurrent operations\n5. Account lifecycle management integration with multi-service workflows\n6. Cross-environment business rules with configuration service integration\n\nRevenue Protection:\n- Tier bypass prevention ensures users cannot illegally access higher tiers\n- Trial period manipulation prevention protects conversion funnel integrity  \n- Concurrent registration race conditions prevent double registrations that affect metrics\n- Account lifecycle enforcement ensures proper onboarding and billing transitions\n\nAll tests focus on business value scenarios where integration failures would cause\nrevenue loss, user experience degradation, or security vulnerabilities.",

Current system has 30+ duplicate Redis configuration \nimplementations with different fallback behaviors, SSL settings, and connection pooling.\n\nCORE BUSINESS PAIN POINTS THIS TEST EXPOSES:\n1. Silent fallback behavior masks production readiness issues (costs $50K per incident)\n2. Development debugging is 5x slower due to inconsistent configuration patterns\n3. Redis connection failures cause service degradation rather than clear errors\n4. Different services use different Redis configuration patterns (SSOT violation)\n\nCRITICAL PRODUCTION SCENARIO THIS TEST VALIDATES:\nWhen Redis is unavailable in staging, some services fallback gracefully while others fail.\nThis inconsistency means staging doesn't validate production behavior, leading to:\n- Cache misses causing 300% slower response times for Premium/Enterprise customers\n- Session loss requiring user re-authentication (impacts conversion rates)  \n- Background job failures that appear to work but silently drop tasks\n\nTHIS TEST MUST FAIL because current implementation has:\n- RedisManager with localhost fallback in development\n- Background jobs with separate redis_config parameter\n- Different SSL/TLS handling across services  \n- No unified Secret Manager integration for Redis credentials\n- Inconsistent connection pooling across services",
