  <conclusion>
    The implementation of these five AI-native agent strategies will transform the Netra AI
    Optimization Platform into a self-improving, self-healing system that continuously
    evolves to meet user needs while maintaining the highest standards of quality,
    security, and performance. The agents act as force multipliers for the development
    team, handling routine tasks, preventing issues, and enabling developers to focus
    on innovation and strategic improvements.
