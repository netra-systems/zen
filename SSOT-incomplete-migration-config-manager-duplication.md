# SSOT-incomplete-migration-config-manager-duplication

**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/667
**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL
**Status:** DISCOVERY PHASE
**Focus Areas:** config, startup, validation

## Problem Summary

Three separate configuration managers exist with overlapping functionality, creating SSOT violations that block the Golden Path:

1. **UnifiedConfigManager** (`netra_backend/app/core/configuration/base.py:30`)
2. **UnifiedConfigurationManager** (`netra_backend/app/core/managers/unified_configuration_manager.py:180`) - MEGA CLASS 2000+ lines
3. **ConfigurationManager** (`netra_backend/app/services/configuration_service.py:83`)

## Golden Path Impact
- **BLOCKS GOLDEN PATH** - Configuration inconsistencies prevent user login
- Different managers may load conflicting configs causing auth failures
- Test environment caching issues break CI/CD pipeline

## Process Progress Tracking

### Step 0: DISCOVERY âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] SSOT audit completed via subagent
- [x] Critical P0 violation identified
- [x] GitHub issue #667 created
- [x] Local tracking file (IND) created

### Step 1: DISCOVER AND PLAN TEST (PENDING)
- [ ] 1.1 DISCOVER EXISTING: Find existing tests protecting against config breaking changes
- [ ] 1.2 PLAN ONLY: Plan unit, integration (non-docker), e2e gcp staging tests for SSOT refactor

### Step 2: EXECUTE TEST PLAN (PENDING)
- [ ] Create new SSOT tests (20% of work)
- [ ] Run tests that don't require docker

### Step 3: PLAN REMEDIATION (PENDING)
- [ ] Plan SSOT remediation strategy
- [ ] Identify migration path for consumers

### Step 4: EXECUTE REMEDIATION (PENDING)
- [ ] Implement SSOT consolidation
- [ ] Migrate consumers to unified interface

### Step 5: TEST FIX LOOP (PENDING)
- [ ] Prove changes maintain system stability
- [ ] Run all tests in tracking file
- [ ] Fix any issues found

### Step 6: PR AND CLOSURE (PENDING)
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Link to issue #667 for auto-closure

## Business Risk Assessment
- **Business Risk:** HIGH - Could break user authentication and system startup
- **Technical Risk:** MEDIUM - Well-isolated refactoring with clear interfaces
- **Golden Path Risk:** HIGH - Configuration is foundation for all user flows
- **Revenue Impact:** $500K+ ARR at risk from configuration-related system failures
