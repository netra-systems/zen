## ðŸš¨ P0 REGRESSION: HTTP 503 Service Unavailable Cluster Issue

**Status:** ACTIVE REGRESSION affecting production services
**Impact:** Service availability and WebSocket connectivity
**Priority:** P0 - Critical infrastructure failure
**Generated:** 2025-09-15 by Claude Code automated monitoring

### Problem Summary

Multiple HTTP 503 Service Unavailable errors detected across health check and WebSocket endpoints, indicating a cluster-wide service availability issue affecting critical infrastructure.

### Impact Assessment

**Business Impact:**
- Health check endpoints returning 503 errors
- WebSocket connectivity potentially affected
- Service discovery and load balancing may be impaired
- User experience degradation for real-time features

**Technical Impact:**
- Multiple service endpoints unavailable
- Health check failures may trigger cascading effects
- Load balancer may be removing healthy instances
- WebSocket connections failing or unstable

### Evidence

**Error Pattern:**
```
HTTP 503 Service Unavailable
- Health check endpoints
- WebSocket endpoints
- Multiple timestamp clusters
```

**Affected Components:**
- Health check endpoints (`/health`, `/readiness`)
- WebSocket endpoints (`/ws/*`)
- Service discovery mechanisms
- Load balancer health checks

### Investigation Required

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Service Status Check:** Verify all GCP services are running
2. **Load Balancer Analysis:** Check load balancer configuration and health
3. **VPC Connector Status:** Verify VPC connector for service communication
4. **Resource Availability:** Check CPU, memory, and connection limits
5. **Service Dependencies:** Verify Redis, PostgreSQL, and external service availability

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Traffic Patterns:** Analyze request volume and patterns leading to 503s
2. **Resource Exhaustion:** Check for memory, CPU, or connection pool exhaustion
3. **Configuration Drift:** Verify GCP configuration matches expected state
4. **Dependency Failures:** Check upstream service health and connectivity
5. **Scaling Issues:** Verify auto-scaling configuration and limits

### Technical Context

**Architecture Context:**
- Multi-service GCP deployment
- Load balancer with health check configuration
- VPC connector for internal service communication
- WebSocket real-time communication requirements

**Related Systems:**
- GCP Cloud Run services
- Load balancer health checks
- VPC networking and connectors
- Redis and PostgreSQL dependencies

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All health check endpoints return 200 OK consistently
- [ ] WebSocket endpoints respond without 503 errors
- [ ] Service availability restored to >99.9%
- [ ] Root cause identified and documented
- [ ] Preventive measures implemented
- [ ] Monitoring enhanced to detect similar issues earlier

### Priority Justification

**P0 Classification Rationale:**
- Service availability directly impacts customer experience
- Health check failures can cascade to service removal from load balancer
- WebSocket connectivity critical for real-time user interactions
- Cluster-wide issue suggests infrastructure-level problem

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Investigation:** Service status and resource analysis
2. **Escalation Path:** Infrastructure team for GCP-specific issues
3. **Monitoring Enhancement:** Add specific 503 error tracking
4. **Documentation:** Record findings and resolution steps
