## Status: RESOLVED ✅

**Root Cause:** Missing `validate_token` import in auth service caused test failures during SSOT consolidation migration.

**Fix Applied:** Added backward compatibility shim in `auth_service/auth_core/user_auth_service.py` lines 41-49 to maintain API contract while preserving SSOT architecture.

## Five Whys Analysis

1. **WHY 1:** Tests failed due to missing `validate_token` import
2. **WHY 2:** Function was removed during SSOT consolidation
3. **WHY 3:** Test infrastructure wasn't updated during migration
4. **WHY 4:** The function has been restored as backward compatibility shim
5. **WHY 5:** Issue is now resolved and tests pass

## Test Results ✅

- **Import test:** SUCCESS - `validate_token` can be imported
- **Unit test:** PASSED - `test_validate_token_function_alias_success`
- **File verification:** CONFIRMED - Function exists in `user_auth_service.py` lines 41-49

## Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
- `auth_service/auth_core/user_auth_service.py` - Added compatibility alias

**Solution:**
```python
def validate_token(token: str) -> dict:
    """Backward compatibility alias for token validation."""
    from .token_validator import validate_jwt_token
    return validate_jwt_token(token)
```

**Business Value:** Maintains SSOT architecture while preserving test compatibility, ensuring auth service reliability for $500K+ ARR customer base.

**Next Action:** Issue closed - no further action required.
