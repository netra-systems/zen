# Auth Context Middleware Failure - Auto Solve Loop 20250909

## Issue Identification
**Issue**: Critical Auth Context Middleware Failure - "SessionMiddleware must be installed to access request.session"

**Priority**: CRITICAL (Blocking golden path, websockets, and auth flows)

**Evidence from GCP Staging Logs**:
- Continuous WARNING messages from `netra_backend.app.middleware.gcp_auth_context_middleware`
- Error: "Failed to extract auth context: SessionMiddleware must be installed to access request.session"
- Affecting ALL requests to staging backend
- Timestamp range: 2025-09-09 16:30:52 through 16:33:51

**Associated Issues**:
- 404 errors on health endpoints (/staging/health/database, /staging/health/metrics)
- Invalid E2E bypass key warnings from auth service
- Potential auth flow disruption for golden path

## Deduplication Analysis
This issue is widespread and systematic - affecting every single backend request in staging environment. This is not a transient error but a configuration/middleware setup problem.

## Analysis Phase
Date: 2025-09-09
Session: 1/10 of auto-solve-loop

## Five Whys Analysis (Completed by Sub-Agent)

**Root Cause Identified**: Middleware installation order violation - `GCPAuthContextMiddleware` is being installed before `SessionMiddleware`, creating a dependency inversion where the auth middleware tries to access session data that hasn't been initialized yet.

**Critical Impact**: This affects ALL requests to the staging backend and blocks the golden path user flow, making this a system-wide stability issue requiring immediate remediation.

**Environment Scope**: This is environment-specific (only affecting staging/production) and creates cascade failures including health endpoint 404 errors.

**Fix Required**: Reordering the middleware installation sequence to ensure proper dependency resolution.

## Test Suite Plan (Completed by Sub-Agent)

**Comprehensive Test Strategy Planned**:
- **Unit Tests**: Middleware dependency validation, session access pattern tests
- **Integration Tests**: Full middleware stack validation with proper ordering
- **E2E Tests**: Golden path user flow validation, WebSocket authentication flow
- **Staging Environment**: Real GCP validation, multi-user session isolation
- **Regression Prevention**: Configuration change detection, deployment validation

**Expected Test Difficulty**: CRITICAL - All tests should fail initially, demonstrating the issue, then pass after middleware ordering fix.

**Authentication Requirements**: ALL E2E tests MUST use real authentication (E2EAuthHelper) - NO MOCKS allowed.
