# GCP Staging Auto-Solve Loop - Cycle 1 Debug Log
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Issue Focus:** Recurring WebSocket errors causing 500 status codes

## IDENTIFIED ISSUE (Cycle 1)

**ISSUE:** WebSocket Coroutine Attribute Error - Critical
- **Type:** WebSocket Error  
- **Severity:** ERROR (Critical)
- **Frequency:** Recurring (multiple occurrences in logs)
- **Service:** netra-backend-staging
- **Status Code:** HTTP 500

**Error Details:**
```
WebSocket error: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'get'
Location: netra_backend.app.routes.websocket:557 (websocket_endpoint function)
Module: netra_backend.app.routes.websocket
```

**Evidence from GCP Logs:**
- Multiple identical errors at lines 219, 422, 489 in gcp_logs_iteration_3_analysis.json
- Timestamps: 2025-09-07T15:42:02.022079+00:00, 2025-09-07T15:42:01.008557+00:00, 2025-09-07T15:42:00.633251+00:00
- HTTP 500 responses on /ws endpoint with traces from staging environment
- User-Agent: "Netra-E2E-Tests/1.0" indicating E2E test failures

**Impact Assessment:**
- Breaks critical WebSocket functionality (90% of platform value per CLAUDE.md)
- Prevents real-time agent communication
- Causes E2E test failures
- Results in HTTP 500 errors for users

**Priority Justification:**
1. ERROR severity (highest priority)
2. Affects core chat functionality (business-critical)
3. Recurring pattern showing regression issue
4. Preventing successful deployments

## NOTES
- This appears to be a coroutine/async handling issue in the WebSocket endpoint
- May be related to improper awaiting of async functions
- Could be regression from recent WebSocket changes
- Critical for Golden Path user flow (login â†’ AI responses)
