# Database Table Migration Inconsistency Debug Log - 20250909

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED
**Database Table Migration Inconsistency - Missing Critical User Tables**

### Primary Problem
Golden Path Validation Failure due to missing critical user tables, specifically `user_sessions` table, combined with schema validation warnings about extra auth-related tables that exist in the database but are not defined in the current models.

### Error Symptoms from GCP Staging Logs (2025-09-10T00:33:54Z)

**CRITICAL FAILURES:**
```
✗ Missing critical user tables: ['user_sessions']
✗ Golden path validation failed: Users cannot log in without proper auth=REDACTED
✗ Service dependency validation FAILED - 0 services failed, critical business functionality at risk
```

**SCHEMA VALIDATION WARNINGS:**
```
⚠️ Extra tables in database not defined in models: 
   {'auth_users', 'password_reset_tokens', 'alembic_version', 'auth_audit_logs', 'auth_sessions'}
```

**SYSTEM STATE:**
```
- Migration Mode: factory_preferred
- Startup validation: BYPASSED (BYPASS_STARTUP_VALIDATION=true)
- Critical failures: 1
- Business impact: Chat functionality threatened
```

### Business Impact
This is preventing users from logging in and threatening the core chat functionality business value. The golden path user flow cannot complete without proper authentication and session management.

## Log Analysis Timeline

### Recent Deployment (2025-09-10T00:33:51Z)
- Alembic migrations completed successfully
- Context impl PostgresqlImpl initialized
- Transactional DDL assumed
- Migration status shows "Step 3: Migrations completed"

### Validation Failures (2025-09-10T00:33:54Z)
- Golden path validation immediately failed after migration completion
- Critical user tables missing despite migration success
- Auth-related tables exist but not defined in current models

## Next Steps
1. Five WHYs Analysis via sub-agent
2. Plan comprehensive database schema test suite
3. Create GitHub issue with claude-code-generated-issue label
4. Execute remediation plan
