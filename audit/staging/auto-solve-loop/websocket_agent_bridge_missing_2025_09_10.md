# GCP Staging Audit Loop - WebSocket Agent Bridge Missing

**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Issue**: WebSocket Agent Bridge Module Missing - Complete Golden Path Failure  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - $500K+ ARR IMPACT  
**Focus**: Golden Path  

## PRIMARY ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**CHOSEN ISSUE**: `No module named 'netra_backend.app.agents.agent_websocket_bridge'`

**Log Evidence**:
```
insertId: 68c268910006c53586af3c44
severity: ERROR
message: "Agent handler setup failed: No module named 'netra_backend.app.agents.agent_websocket_bridge'"
function: _setup_agent_handlers
module: netra_backend.app.routes.websocket_ssot
line: 742
timestamp: 2025-09-11T06:13:37.440808+00:00
```

**Cascading Errors**:
1. `create_server_message() missing 1 required positional argument: 'data'`
2. `Cannot call "send" once a close message has been sent`
3. `Failed to extract auth=REDACTED SessionMiddleware must be installed to access request.session`
4. `422` errors on `/api/agent/v2/execute` endpoint

## BUSINESS IMPACT

**CRITICAL - GOLDEN PATH COMPLETELY BROKEN**:
- ❌ Users cannot execute agents
- ❌ No WebSocket communication between agents and frontend  
- ❌ Chat functionality (90% of platform value) completely broken
- ❌ $500K+ ARR at risk due to non-functional core feature
- ❌ Emergency WebSocket manager being created as fallback

## LOG ANALYSIS DETAILS

**Primary Error Pattern**: Missing module prevents WebSocket agent integration
**Frequency**: Every WebSocket connection attempt
**HTTP Status**: 422 Unprocessable Entity on agent execution
**Authentication**: Multiple session middleware warnings

**Request Pattern**:
```
POST /api/agent/v2/execute -> 422 
referer: https://app.staging.netrasystems.ai/
userAgent: Chrome/139.0.0.0 Safari/537.36  
latency: ~0.03-0.05s
```

## FIVE WHYS ANALYSIS - COMPLETED

### Why 1: Why is the agent_websocket_bridge module missing?
**Analysis**: The module is NOT actually missing. The file `netra_backend/app/services/agent_websocket_bridge.py` exists with the `create_agent_websocket_bridge` function. The issue is incorrect import paths in `websocket_ssot.py` (lines 732 and 747) trying to import from `netra_backend.app.agents.agent_websocket_bridge` instead of the correct path `netra_backend.app.services.agent_websocket_bridge`.

### Why 2: Why was the incorrect import path used?
**Analysis**: The incorrect import path was introduced during the creation of `websocket_ssot.py` in commit 25a670e92 on September 10, 2025. This was likely a copy-paste error where the developer expected WebSocket bridge functionality to be in the `agents` directory rather than in the `services` directory.

### Why 3: Why was there confusion about location (agents vs services)?
**Analysis**: The agent_websocket_bridge serves as a bridge between agents and WebSocket infrastructure, making its location conceptually ambiguous. Documentation artifacts throughout the codebase reference both correct and incorrect paths, creating confusion.

### Why 4: Why do documentation artifacts exist with incorrect paths?
**Analysis**: The codebase underwent multiple refactoring cycles around WebSocket and agent integration SSOT consolidation. During these cycles, some documentation was updated while others were not, creating inconsistent information.

### Why 5: Why wasn't this caught during development/testing?
**Analysis**: The `websocket_ssot.py` is likely not the primary WebSocket route being used in current testing scenarios. The error only manifests when this specific SSOT route is activated and agent handler setup functions are called.

### ROOT CAUSE
**Incorrect import path in `websocket_ssot.py`** caused by copy-paste error during SSOT consolidation, using logical but incorrect path `netra_backend.app.agents.agent_websocket_bridge` instead of correct path `netra_backend.app.services.agent_websocket_bridge`.

### IMPACT CHAIN
1. websocket_ssot.py tries to import from non-existent path
2. Import fails → Agent handler registration fails
3. WebSocket connections cannot route agent messages
4. `/api/agent/v2/execute` returns 422 errors  
5. Golden Path completely breaks
6. $500K+ ARR impacted - chat functionality unavailable

### IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED
**Two-line fix in `netra_backend/app/routes/websocket_ssot.py`**:
- Line 732: Change import from `agents.agent_websocket_bridge` to `services.agent_websocket_bridge`
- Line 747: Change import from `agents.agent_websocket_bridge` to `services.agent_websocket_bridge`
