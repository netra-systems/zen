# GCP WebSocket Redis Failure Debug Log - Cycle 1
**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Issue:** GCP WebSocket Readiness Validation Failed - Redis Service Failure  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocks Golden Path User Flow Completion  
**Impact:** Prevents WebSocket agent events from delivering AI chat value

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Error from GCP Staging Logs:**
```
CRITICAL STARTUP FAILURE: GCP WebSocket readiness validation failed. Failed services: [redis]. State: failed. Elapsed: 7.50s. This will cause 1011 WebSocket errors in GCP Cloud Run.
```

**Context:**
- Service: netra-backend-staging  
- Time: 2025-09-09T02:53:47Z
- Error Location: netra_backend.app.smd.py:1246 in _validate_gcp_websocket_readiness
- Worker Process Failed: pid:14 exited with code 3

## BUSINESS VALUE IMPACT

This failure directly prevents the **Mission Critical WebSocket Agent Events** that enable:
1. **agent_started** - Users cannot see agent began processing
2. **agent_thinking** - No real-time reasoning visibility 
3. **tool_executing** - No tool usage transparency
4. **tool_completed** - No actionable insights delivery
5. **agent_completed** - Users don't know when response is ready

This blocks the core business value of substantive AI chat interactions.

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Error Chain:**
1. Redis service fails during GCP WebSocket readiness validation
2. _validate_gcp_websocket_readiness fails after 7.50s timeout
3. DeterministicStartupError raised
4. Worker process exits with code 3
5. Master process shuts down due to worker failure

**Related Systems:**
- SMD (Service Management Daemon) startup validation
- WebSocket readiness middleware
- Redis connectivity for session management
- GCP Cloud Run deployment health checks
