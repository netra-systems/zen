# ClickHouse Error Logging Golden Path Issue - 2025-09-09

## ISSUE IDENTIFICATION
**Primary Issue**: ClickHouse Connection Failures generating ERROR-level logs despite graceful degradation in golden path

**Issue Type**: Observability/Logging Configuration Error  
**Severity**: HIGH (affects golden path monitoring and error visibility)  
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Environment**: GCP Staging

## ERROR EVIDENCE FROM STAGING LOGS

```
[ClickHouse] REAL connection failed in staging: Could not connect to ClickHouse: Error HTTPSConnectionPool(host='clickhouse.staging.netrasystems.ai', port=8443): Max retries exceeded with url: /? (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7f741542f450>, 'Connection to clickhouse.staging.netrasystems.ai timed out. (connect timeout=10)')) executing HTTP request attempt 1 (https://clickhouse.staging.netrasystems.ai:8443)
```

**Contradictory Logging**:
- ERROR level: "ClickHouse REAL connection failed"  
- WARNING level: "Connection failed in staging but not required - graceful degradation"

## BUSINESS IMPACT ON GOLDEN PATH

1. **Error Noise**: Genuine critical errors are masked by expected failures
2. **False Alerting**: Monitoring systems may trigger alerts for expected behavior
3. **Developer Confusion**: ERROR logs for intentionally optional services
4. **Golden Path Observability**: Harder to identify real golden path failures

## TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

**Root Issue**: ClickHouse connection failures are logged at ERROR level even when:
- Service is intentionally optional in staging
- Graceful degradation is working correctly
- System continues to function normally

**Location**: `netra_backend.app.core.unified_logging`
**Log Line**: 202 (ERROR level emission)

## STATUS
- [x] Issue identified from staging logs
- [ ] Five Whys analysis pending
- [ ] Test plan pending
- [ ] Fix implementation pending
- [ ] Validation pending

## NEXT ACTIONS
1. Five Whys root cause analysis
2. Create failing test for proper log levels
3. Fix logging configuration to use WARNING for optional services
4. Validate golden path observability improvement
