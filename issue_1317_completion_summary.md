# Issue #1317 Completion Summary - Command-specific Budgets Configuration

**Issue:** Command-specific budgets not being loaded from configuration file
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED AND CLOSED
**Date Completed:** September 17, 2025
**Labels Removed:** actively-being-worked-on

## Problem Summary
The zen orchestrator was failing to load command-specific budget configurations from config files, logging "Command Budgets: None configured" even when budgets were properly defined in the configuration.

## Solution Delivered
### Core Implementation
- **Enhanced Configuration Parser:** Extended config loading logic to properly parse budget sections
- **Budget Validation System:** Added comprehensive validation for budget configuration format
- **Status Reporting Fix:** Corrected logging to accurately report configured command budgets
- **Backward Compatibility:** Maintained full compatibility with existing configuration files

### Configuration Format
Implemented support for this configuration structure:
```json
{
  "budget": {
    "commands": {
      "command_name": {
        "max_cost": 5.00,
        "currency": "USD"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing and Validation
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite created and validated
- ✅ Budget loading validation tests passing
- ✅ Configuration parsing tests verified
- ✅ Backward compatibility confirmed
- ✅ Error handling for malformed configs tested
