# Issue #1208 Untangle - Command Summary

## Finding: Issue #1208 Does Not Exist

Issue #1208 is a **phantom issue** that doesn't exist in the GitHub repository. Since it doesn't exist, we cannot close it. Instead, we need to:

1. Create a new cleanup issue
2. Remove phantom references from automation

## Commands to Execute

### 1. Create New GitHub Issue for Cleanup
```bash
# Create the new issue to track cleanup work
gh issue create --title "[CLEANUP] Remove phantom issue #1208 reference from automation configs" \
  --body-file GITHUB_ISSUE_PHANTOM_1208_CLEANUP_BODY.md \
  --repo netra-systems/netra-apex \
  --label "P2,enhancement,automation,claude-code-generated-issue"
```

### 2. Cannot Close Issue #1208 (It Doesn't Exist)
```bash
# This will fail because issue #1208 doesn't exist:
# gh issue close 1208 --comment "Phantom issue - does not exist"

# Instead, add a comment to the NEW issue once created:
gh issue comment [NEW_ISSUE_NUMBER] --body "This issue tracks cleanup of phantom issue #1208 references. The original issue #1208 does not exist in the repository."
```

### 3. Remove Phantom References (Manual Steps)
```bash
# Search for any references to issue #1208
grep -r "1208" --include="*.json" --include="*.md" --include="*.yml" .

# Edit config files to remove references
# Particularly check: /scripts/config-issue-untangle.json
```
