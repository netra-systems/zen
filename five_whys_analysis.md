# Five Whys Root Cause Analysis - Mission Critical Test Import Failures

## Issue 1: UnifiedWebSocketManager Import Failure

**Failing Import:**
```python
from netra_backend.app.websocket_core.unified_manager import UnifiedWebSocketManager
```

### Five Whys Analysis:

**WHY 1:** Import fails because `UnifiedWebSocketManager` is not exported from `unified_manager.py`
- **Evidence:** `__all__ = ['WebSocketConnection', '_serialize_message_safely', 'WebSocketManagerMode']` - missing UnifiedWebSocketManager

**WHY 2:** Export was intentionally removed during SSOT consolidation (Issue #824)
- **Evidence:** Comments in file show "UnifiedWebSocketManager export removed - use WebSocketManager from websocket_manager.py"

**WHY 3:** SSOT consolidation completed but import statements in tests were not updated
- **Evidence:** Correct import available in `websocket_manager.py` with `__all__` including `'UnifiedWebSocketManager'`

**WHY 4:** No automated import validation during SSOT migration process
- **Evidence:** Mission critical tests were not run during consolidation to catch breaking changes

**WHY 5:** Architectural migration lacks systematic validation process ensuring business continuity
- **Root Cause:** SSOT improvements prioritized code organization over maintaining test suite functionality

**Correct Import Path:**
```python
from netra_backend.app.websocket_core.websocket_manager import UnifiedWebSocketManager
```

## Issue 2: CircuitBreakerState Import Failure

**Failing Import:**
```python
from netra_backend.app.services.circuit_breaker import CircuitBreakerState
```

### Five Whys Analysis:

**WHY 1:** `CircuitBreakerState` is not exported from circuit_breaker package
- **Evidence:** `__all__` in `__init__.py` only includes: `CircuitBreakerManager`, `CircuitBreaker`, `CircuitBreakerConfig`, `ServiceHealthMonitor`, `FailureDetector`

**WHY 2:** The class was renamed to `UnifiedCircuitBreakerState` during SSOT consolidation
- **Evidence:** Underlying module has `UnifiedCircuitBreakerState` class, not `CircuitBreakerState`

**WHY 3:** SSOT consolidation changed class names but didn't update dependent imports or add aliases
- **Evidence:** No backward compatibility alias created in `__init__.py`

**WHY 4:** Test code written against old API was not updated during SSOT migration
- **Evidence:** Tests still reference old class names that no longer exist

**WHY 5:** Migration process lacks comprehensive backward compatibility strategy
- **Root Cause:** SSOT improvements focus on consolidation without maintaining API stability for existing consumers

**Correct Import Path:**
```python
from netra_backend.app.core.resilience.unified_circuit_breaker import UnifiedCircuitBreakerState
```

## Issue 3: CircuitOpenException Import Failure

**Failing Import:**
```python
from netra_backend.app.services.circuit_breaker import CircuitOpenException
```

### Five Whys Analysis:

**WHY 1:** `CircuitOpenException` class doesn't exist in the circuit breaker package
- **Evidence:** Not found in any circuit breaker module or `__all__` exports

**WHY 2:** Exception class was either never implemented or removed during SSOT consolidation
- **Evidence:** Only `RetryExhaustedException` found in resilience module

**WHY 3:** Test was written expecting exception class that was planned but not implemented
- **Evidence:** Test assumes exception-based error handling pattern not used in current implementation

**WHY 4:** API design inconsistency between planned interface and actual implementation
- **Evidence:** Circuit breaker uses state-based error handling, not exception-based

**WHY 5:** Insufficient API specification and validation during development
- **Root Cause:** Test development proceeded based on assumptions rather than actual implemented API

## Issue 4: Missing test_framework.docker_circuit_breaker Module

**Failing Import:**
```python
from test_framework.docker_circuit_breaker import (...)
```

### Five Whys Analysis:

**WHY 1:** `docker_circuit_breaker` module doesn't exist in test_framework
- **Evidence:** Only `performance_test_circuit_breaker.py` exists in test_framework/ssot/

**WHY 2:** Module was either never created or removed during SSOT consolidation
- **Evidence:** Test expects module that was planned but not implemented

**WHY 3:** Test development proceeded without verifying module existence
- **Evidence:** Import written based on planned architecture, not actual implementation

**WHY 4:** Test infrastructure development lacks validation of dependencies
- **Evidence:** No test for test framework imports before writing dependent tests

**WHY 5:** Development process allows tests to be written against non-existent infrastructure
- **Root Cause:** Insufficient development process requiring import validation before test implementation

## Systemic Root Cause Summary

All four issues stem from **architectural migration governance gaps**:

1. **SSOT consolidation prioritized code organization over business continuity**
2. **Missing systematic validation during architectural changes**
3. **No automated testing of critical test suites during migration**
4. **Lack of backward compatibility strategy for API changes**
5. **Development process allows untested assumptions about infrastructure**

## Business Impact

- **Mission Critical Tests:** 10+ test files failing to execute
- **Coverage Gap:** $500K+ ARR protection tests unable to run
- **Golden Path:** WebSocket event validation completely blocked
- **Infrastructure Reliability:** Circuit breaker resilience patterns untestable
- **Development Velocity:** Reduced confidence in system stability
