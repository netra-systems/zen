## Specific Issue #579 Integration Points

### 1. UserExecutionEngine Integration âœ…

**Location:** `/netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/user_execution_engine.py`

**Integration Evidence:**
- Lines 1401-1420: Issue #579 sanitization logic properly integrated
- Sanitization occurs after agent execution but before caching
- Error handling preserves original functionality if sanitization fails
- Clean separation between core execution and sanitization concerns

**Code Verification:**
```python
# ISSUE #585 FIX: Sanitize result to prevent pickle serialization errors
# Check if result is safe for caching and sanitize if needed
try:
    if not is_safe_for_caching(result):
        logger.info(f"Sanitizing agent result for {agent_name} to prevent serialization errors")
        
        # Create clean SerializableAgentResult
        sanitized_result = sanitize_agent_result(result)
        
        # Store reference to sanitized result for caching
        self.set_agent_result(f"{agent_name}_sanitized", sanitized_result)
        
        logger.debug(f"Agent result sanitized for {agent_name} - safe for Redis caching")
    else:
        logger.debug(f"Agent result for {agent_name} already safe for caching")
        
except Exception as sanitization_error:
    logger.warning(f"Result sanitization failed for {agent_name}: {sanitization_error}")
    # Continue with original result - sanitization is not critical for functionality
```

### 2. OptimizationsCoreSubAgent Integration âœ…

**Location:** `/netra_backend/app/agents/optimizations_core_sub_agent.py`

**Integration Evidence:**
- Lines 373-451: `create_clean_optimization_result()` method added

- Proper error handling and fallback to minimal safe results
- Integration with `SerializableAgentResult` class

**Functionality Validation:**
- âœ… Extracts optimization insights safely
- âœ… Handles cost analysis data properly
- âœ… Converts recommendations to serializable format
- âœ… Creates clean result objects for Redis caching

### 3. UnifiedDataAgent Integration âœ…

**Location:** `/netra_backend/app/agents/data/unified_data_agent.py`

**Integration Evidence:**
- Inherits from BaseAgent with full infrastructure including serialization
- Uses modern UserExecutionContext patterns
- Enables caching with clean result generation
- Proper integration with Issue #579 sanitization pipeline
