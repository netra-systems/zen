# SSOT Incomplete Migration: JWT Authentication Logic Duplication

**Issue:** [#184](https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/184)  
**Created:** 2025-09-10  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Focus Area:** Golden Path User Flow (Login → AI Responses)

## Problem Statement

Critical JWT authentication SSOT violations directly blocking golden path user flow. Backend contains duplicated JWT logic that should exclusively reside in auth service, creating authentication inconsistencies that prevent users from completing login → AI response journey.

**Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR chat functionality blocked  
**SSOT Compliance Score:** 40/100

## Critical Violations Identified

### 1. Backend JWT Decoding Duplication
- **File:** `netra_backend/app/clients/auth_client_core.py`
- **Lines:** 940-955 (`_decode_test_jwt()`), 1016-1028 (`_decode_token()`)
- **Issue:** Backend directly decodes JWT tokens instead of using auth service

### 2. Backend JWT Secret Management  
- **File:** `netra_backend/app/core/configuration/unified_secrets.py`
- **Lines:** 75-90
- **Issue:** JWT secret retrieval logic duplicated outside auth service

### 3. WebSocket Auth Validation Duplication
- **File:** `netra_backend/app/websocket_core/auth.py` 
- **Lines:** 41-108 (`authenticate()` method with local validation fallback)
- **Issue:** WebSocket bypasses auth service with local JWT validation

## Root Cause Analysis
Production incident pressure led to architectural compromises bypassing auth service SSOT without proper review.

## Work Progress

### Phase 0: SSOT Audit ✅
- [x] Identified critical JWT SSOT violations
- [x] Created GitHub issue #184
- [x] Created progress tracking document

### Phase 1: Test Discovery ✅
- [x] Find existing tests protecting JWT authentication SSOT
- [x] Validate current test coverage for auth centralization  
- [x] Document gaps in SSOT test validation

**Key Findings:**
- **Strong Coverage:** 120+ mission-critical tests protecting JWT flows
- **SSOT Framework:** Automated compliance checking with `/scripts/check_auth_ssot_compliance.py`
- **Coverage Gaps:** Missing specific tests for methods we need to remove
- **Protection:** Real service integration tests ensure refactor safety

### Phase 2: Test Planning ✅
- [x] Plan failing tests that reproduce SSOT violations
- [x] Design tests for ideal SSOT state (all JWT via auth service)
- [x] Align with testing best practices from reports/testing/TEST_CREATION_GUIDE.md

### Phase 3: New Test Implementation ✅  
- [x] Create ~20% new tests focused on SSOT validation
- [x] Run tests without Docker (unit/integration/staging e2e only)
- [x] Ensure tests detect violations in current state

**Test Results:** 9/10 tests PASSED proving SSOT violations exist:
- ✅ Backend JWT secret access violations detected
- ✅ WebSocket auth fallback logic violations detected
- ✅ Multiple JWT sources confirmed (SSOT violation)
- ✅ Comprehensive violation inventory working
- ❌ 1 test failed (some violations may be partially fixed)

### Phase 4: SSOT Remediation Planning ✅
- [x] Design auth service API calls to replace local JWT logic
- [x] Plan WebSocket auth refactor to use auth service exclusively
- [x] Create migration strategy for backend JWT removal

**Key Plan Elements:**
- **4-Phase Migration:** Auth API → Integration → Legacy Removal → Cleanup
- **Circuit Breaker:** Graceful degradation with fallback mechanisms
- **Performance Optimization:** Caching, connection pooling, rate limiting
- **Golden Path Protection:** Comprehensive validation at each phase
- **Zero-Downtime Strategy:** Dual-path validation during migration

### Phase 5: SSOT Remediation Execution (In Progress)
- [ ] Phase 1: Enhance auth service with JWT validation APIs
- [ ] Phase 2: Add auth service client integration to backend  
- [ ] Phase 3: Remove legacy JWT logic incrementally
- [ ] Phase 4: Final cleanup and SSOT validation

### Phase 6: Test Fix Loop (Pending)
- [ ] Run all SSOT validation tests
- [ ] Fix any failures from remediation
- [ ] Ensure 100% test pass rate
- [ ] Validate golden path user flow works end-to-end

### Phase 7: PR and Closure (Pending)
- [ ] Create pull request with SSOT fixes
- [ ] Cross-link issue #184 for auto-close
- [ ] Document SSOT compliance improvement

## Expected Outcome
- JWT authentication centralized exclusively in auth service
- Backend uses auth service API for all JWT operations  
- SSOT compliance score improved from 40/100 to 95+/100
- Golden path user flow (login → AI responses) unblocked
- $500K+ ARR chat functionality restored
