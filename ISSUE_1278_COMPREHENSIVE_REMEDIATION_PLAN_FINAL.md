## 1. IMMEDIATE REMEDIATION ACTIONS (48 Hours)

### 1.1. VPC Connector Capacity Optimization

**Current State:** VPC connector configured with max 20 instances at e2-standard-4  
**Root Constraint:** Connector capacity exhaustion during concurrent connection bursts  

**Remediation Actions:**

#### A. Connection Pool Optimization
```python
# File: /Users/anthony/Desktop/netra-apex/netra_backend/app/core/database_timeout_config.py
# Current staging config (lines 200-220):
"pool_config": {
    "pool_size": 10,              # KEEP: Already optimized for Cloud SQL limits
    "max_overflow": 15,           # REDUCE to 10: Lower VPC connector pressure  
    "pool_timeout": 90.0,         # INCREASE to 120.0: Account for VPC scaling delays
    "vpc_connector_capacity_buffer": 5,   # INCREASE to 8: More VPC capacity reserved
    "cloud_sql_capacity_limit": 100,     # KEEP: Accurate for current instance
}
```

#### B. Connection Timing Optimization
```python
# File: /Users/anthony/Desktop/netra-apex/netra_backend/app/core/database_timeout_config.py  
# Update staging timeouts (lines 185-195):
"staging": {
    "initialization_timeout": 90.0,    # INCREASE from 75.0: Handle VPC scaling delays
    "connection_timeout": 45.0,        # INCREASE from 35.0: VPC connector bursts
    "pool_timeout": 120.0,             # INCREASE from 45.0: Handle capacity pressure
}
```

#### C. Circuit Breaker Tuning
```python
# File: /Users/anthony/Desktop/netra-apex/netra_backend/app/db/database_manager.py
# Update _get_infrastructure_aware_timeout() method:
def _get_infrastructure_aware_timeout(self) -> float:
    """Calculate circuit breaker timeout based on infrastructure conditions."""
    if environment in ["staging", "production"]:
        # VPC connector + Cloud SQL requires longer circuit breaker timeouts
        infrastructure_timeout = get_capacity_aware_database_timeout(environment, "circuit_breaker")
        return max(15.0, infrastructure_timeout * 0.6)  # Increase from 0.5 to 0.6
    return 10.0  # Increase from 5.0 for dev environments
```

### 1.2. Cloud Run Configuration Optimization

**Current State:** Backend configured with 4Gi memory, 4 CPU, 1-20 instances  
**Issue:** Resource allocation doesn't match VPC connector scaling pattern  

**Remediation Actions:**

#### A. Update Cloud Run Deployment Configuration
```python
# File: /Users/anthony/Desktop/netra-apex/scripts/deploy_to_gcp_actual.py
# Lines 98-130 - Backend service configuration:
ServiceConfig(
    memory="6Gi",               # INCREASE from 4Gi: Better connection pool handling
    cpu="4",                    # KEEP: Adequate for current load
    min_instances=2,            # INCREASE from 1: Reduce cold start pressure on VPC
    max_instances=15,           # REDUCE from 20: Align with VPC connector capacity
    timeout=900,                # INCREASE from 600: Extended timeout for infrastructure delays
    environment_vars={
        "DATABASE_POOL_SIZE": "8",              # REDUCE from 10: Lower VPC pressure
        "DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW": "8",           # REDUCE from 15: VPC capacity alignment
        "DATABASE_POOL_TIMEOUT": "120",         # INCREASE: Handle VPC scaling delays
        "VPC_CONNECTOR_SCALING_BUFFER": "30",   # NEW: Buffer for VPC scaling events
    }
)
```

#### B. Health Check Configuration
```yaml
# Update load balancer health check settings:
health_check_timeout: 90        # INCREASE from 60: Handle VPC + database delays
startup_timeout: 900           # INCREASE from 600: Infrastructure-aware startup
check_interval: 30             # INCREASE from 15: Reduce VPC connector pressure
```

### 1.3. Database Connection Strategy Optimization

**Current State:** AsyncPG with connection pooling via SQLAlchemy  
**Issue:** Connection establishment timing doesn't account for VPC connector delays  

**Remediation Actions:**

#### A. Connection Retry Strategy
```python
# File: /Users/anthony/Desktop/netra-apex/netra_backend/app/db/database_manager.py
# Update connection retry logic in DatabaseConnection.connect():
async def connect(self) -> bool:
    """Enhanced connection with VPC-aware retry strategy."""
    for attempt in range(4):  # INCREASE from 3: More retries for VPC delays
        try:
            # VPC connector scaling awareness
            if attempt > 0:
                vpc_backoff = min(15.0 * attempt, 45.0)  # Progressive backoff for VPC scaling
                await asyncio.sleep(vpc_backoff)
            
            # Connection attempt with VPC-aware timeout
            vpc_aware_timeout = self._get_infrastructure_aware_timeout()
            connection = await asyncio.wait_for(
                self._establish_connection(),
                timeout=vpc_aware_timeout
            )
            return True
        except asyncio.TimeoutError:
            if attempt < 3:  # Continue retrying
                logger.warning(f"VPC connector capacity delay on attempt {attempt + 1}")
                continue
            raise ConnectionError(f"VPC connector capacity exhausted after {attempt + 1} attempts")
```

## 2. INFRASTRUCTURE CONFIGURATION IMPROVEMENTS (7 Days)

### 2.1. VPC Connector Scaling Strategy

**Current Terraform Configuration:**
```hcl
# File: /Users/anthony/Desktop/netra-apex/terraform-gcp-staging/vpc-connector.tf
resource "google_vpc_access_connector" "staging_connector" {
  min_instances = 3    # Currently configured
  max_instances = 20   # Currently configured  
  machine_type = "e2-standard-4"  # Currently configured
}
```

**Optimization Recommendations:**

#### A. Immediate Capacity Increase
```hcl
# Update VPC connector configuration:
resource "google_vpc_access_connector" "staging_connector" {
  min_instances = 4    # INCREASE from 3: Reduce scaling pressure
  max_instances = 25   # INCREASE from 20: Handle burst capacity
  machine_type = "e2-standard-4"  # KEEP: Adequate for current needs
  
  # NEW: Scaling policy optimization
  scaling_policy {
    target_utilization = 0.7  # Scale before hitting 70% utilization
    cooldown_period = "180s"  # 3 minutes between scaling events
  }
}
```

#### B. VPC Connector Monitoring
```hcl
# Add VPC connector monitoring for capacity planning:
resource "google_monitoring_alert_policy" "vpc_connector_capacity" {
  display_name = "VPC Connector Capacity Alert"
  conditions {
    display_name = "VPC Connector Utilization"
    condition_threshold {
      filter         = "resource.type=\"vpc_access_connector\""
      comparison     = "COMPARISON_GT"
      threshold_value = 0.8  # Alert at 80% utilization
      duration       = "180s"
    }
  }
  
  notification_channels = [google_monitoring_notification_channel.infrastructure_team.name]
}
```

### 2.2. Cloud SQL Optimization

**Current Configuration:** PostgreSQL 14 with standard connection pooling  
**Issue:** Connection pool exhaustion during VPC connector scaling delays  

**Optimization Strategy:**

#### A. Connection Pool Monitoring
```sql
-- Monitor Cloud SQL connection usage:
SELECT 
  datname,
  numbackends,
  xact_commit,
  xact_rollback,
  tup_returned,
  tup_fetched
FROM pg_stat_database
WHERE datname = 'netra_staging';

-- Track connection state distribution:
SELECT 
  state,
  count(*) as connection_count,
  array_agg(application_name) as applications
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE datname = 'netra_staging'
GROUP BY state;
```

#### B. Database Configuration Tuning
```sql
-- Optimize PostgreSQL configuration for VPC connector patterns:
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 120;  -- INCREASE from 100
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_buffers = '256MB';  -- Optimize for concurrent connections
ALTER SYSTEM SET effective_cache_size = '2GB';  -- Improve query performance
ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '64MB';  -- Background task optimization
ALTER SYSTEM SET checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9;  -- Smooth checkpointing
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_buffers = '16MB';  -- WAL buffer optimization
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```
