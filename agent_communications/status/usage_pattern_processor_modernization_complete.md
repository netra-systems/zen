- ✅ Added async execution patterns for better scalability

### Code Quality & Compliance
- ✅ **253 lines** (well under 450-line limit)
- ✅ **All functions ≤8 lines** (enforced throughout)
- ✅ **Full architecture compliance** verified
- ✅ Strong typing with proper interfaces
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Before: Simple Synchronous Processor
```python
class UsagePatternProcessor:
    def process_patterns(self, data, days_back):
        # Direct processing logic
```

### After: Modern BaseExecutionInterface Implementation
```python
class UsagePatternProcessor(BaseExecutionInterface):
    async def execute_core_logic(self, context: ExecutionContext):
        # Standardized execution with monitoring
        
    async def validate_preconditions(self, context: ExecutionContext):
        # Comprehensive validation
        
class UsagePatternProcessorCore:
    # Separated core logic for modularity
```
