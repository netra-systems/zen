# A11Y Forms-Groups Test Fix - 2025-08-19

## Mission Status: COMPLETE ✅

## Problem Fixed
- **Test**: "Form Groups - Complex Form Structures › handles form arrays with dynamic addition/removal"  
- **Error**: TestingLibraryElementError: Found multiple elements with the text of: Contact 2
- **Root Cause**: `screen.getByLabelText('Contact 2')` was matching multiple elements (label + input + button)

## Exact Fix Applied
**File**: `frontend/__tests__/a11y/forms-groups.a11y.test.tsx`

**Changes Made** (Lines 415-416):
```typescript
// BEFORE (failing):
expect(screen.getByLabelText('Contact 2')).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(screen.getByLabelText('Remove contact 1')).toBeInTheDocument();

// AFTER (working):
expect(screen.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Contact 2' })).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Remove contact 1' })).toBeInTheDocument();
```

## Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Multiple elements matched the labelText selector:
  1. Label element with text "Contact 2"
  2. Input element associated via htmlFor/id relationship
  3. Potential aria-labelledby relationships

- **Solution**: Used more specific role-based selectors:
  - `getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Contact 2' })` - Targets input field specifically
  - `getByRole('button', { name: 'Remove contact 1' })` - Targets button specifically
