- Validates multiple fixture interaction patterns
- Edge case testing for async/sync fixture mixing
- Performance impact validation of scope changes

## Technical Details

### Architecture Improvements Validated

1. **Function-Scoped Real Services:** All real service fixtures now function-scoped, eliminating pytest-asyncio compatibility issues
2. **TestContext Factory Pattern:** Centralized test context creation with proper isolation
3. **Event Capture Pipeline:** Robust WebSocket event capture with validation and filtering
4. **Performance Monitoring:** Built-in performance metrics collection for test operations
5. **Environment Isolation:** Proper test environment separation and cleanup

### Integration Points Verified

- ‚úÖ `AgentRegistry.set_websocket_manager()` enhances tool dispatcher
- ‚úÖ `ExecutionEngine` properly initializes WebSocketNotifier
- ‚úÖ `EnhancedToolExecutionEngine` wraps tool execution with events
- ‚úÖ All WebSocket event types properly transmitted and captured
- ‚úÖ User context isolation prevents data leakage between tests

## Business Impact Assessment

### Chat Value Delivery (PRIMARY MISSION) ‚úÖ
- **WebSocket Events:** All required events for meaningful AI interactions validated
- **User Experience:** Real-time updates and progress visibility confirmed operational  
- **Agent Execution:** Tool dispatcher notifications enable transparent problem-solving
