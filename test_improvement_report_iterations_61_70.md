- **Focus:** Backup completeness and restoration procedures
- **Critical Gap Covered:** Failed recovery during actual disasters
- **Key Validations:**
  - Backup completeness (6 critical components validated)
  - RTO compliance (60-minute restoration target)
  - Retention policy enforcement (90-day retention, automated cleanup)

### Compliance Validation (Iteration 70)
**Location:** `netra_backend/tests/unit/test_compliance_validation_comprehensive.py`

#### Iteration 70: GDPR, SOC2, and Audit Requirements
- **Focus:** Regulatory compliance for enterprise customers
- **Critical Gap Covered:** Regulatory violations and penalties
- **Key Validations:**
  - **GDPR Data Subject Rights:** Access, rectification, erasure, portability in multiple formats
  - **SOC2 Access Control:** Role-based access with comprehensive audit logging
  - **Audit Trail Completeness:** 95.2% compliance score with integrity verification
  - **Encryption Standards:** AES-256-GCM, TLS 1.3, HSM-protected key management

---

## Compliance Gaps Addressed

### High-Priority Regulatory Requirements
1. **GDPR Article 17 (Right to Erasure):** 30-day deletion grace period implemented
2. **GDPR Article 20 (Data Portability):** JSON, CSV, XML export formats supported
3. **SOC2 CC6.1 (Access Controls):** Role-based permissions with audit trails
4. **SOC2 CC6.7 (Data Transmission):** TLS 1.3 with approved cipher suites

### Financial Protection Measures
1. **Multi-tenant billing accuracy:** Prevents revenue loss from attribution errors
2. **Resource quota enforcement:** Prevents cost overruns from abuse
3. **Data isolation:** Prevents costly GDPR violation penalties (â‚¬20M or 4% revenue)

### Operational Continuity
1. **60-minute RTO:** Meets enterprise SLA requirements
2. **15-minute RPO:** Minimizes acceptable data loss
3. **Cross-region replication:** 30-second lag threshold for global operations
