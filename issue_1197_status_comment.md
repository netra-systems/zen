## üîç Issue Status Assessment - Agent Session 20250916-144500

### Five Whys Analysis - Current State

**WHY 1:** Why are E2E tests not running reliably?
‚Üí Import path issues and missing fixtures preventing test execution

**WHY 2:** Why are import paths broken?
‚Üí SSOT consolidation removed classes but tests still reference them

**WHY 3:** Why wasn't test compatibility maintained during SSOT?
‚Üí Dependencies (Issues #1181-1186) incomplete, creating import gaps

**WHY 4:** Why are dependencies incomplete?
‚Üí WebSocket and Agent consolidation required careful coordination

**WHY 5:** Why is coordination complex?
‚Üí Golden Path touches all system components requiring staged approach

### Current Assessment

**System Health:** 95% - Golden Path FUNCTIONALLY OPERATIONAL
**Business Impact:** LOW RISK - Core functionality working, validation pending
**Issue Type:** Strategic validation initiative, NOT system failure

**Technical Status:**
‚úÖ Authentication working (JWT integration complete)
‚úÖ WebSocket connections stable 
‚úÖ Agent execution operational
‚úÖ User responses delivered
‚ùå Comprehensive test validation incomplete

**Blocking Dependencies:**
- Issue #1181: MessageRouter Consolidation (BLOCKING)
- Issue #1182: WebSocket Manager SSOT (BLOCKING)  
- Issue #1183: WebSocket Event Validation (CRITICAL)
- Issue #1186: UserExecutionEngine SSOT (BLOCKING)

### Decision: DEPENDENCY COMPLETION REQUIRED

**Assessment:** Issue #1197 cannot proceed until blocking dependencies resolved.
**Strategy:** Focus on Phase 1 infrastructure remediation items that CAN be completed now.

**Immediate Actionable Items:**
1. Fix missing isolated_env fixture
2. Resolve import path errors in mission critical tests
3. Align staging configuration issues
4. Create foundation for dependency completion

**Timeline:** 1 day for foundation work, 2-3 days pending dependency completion
