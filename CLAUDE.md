## 0\. Current Mission: Stabilize Core Systems

Your primary mission is to get existing systems fully operational. **Maintain the current feature set.**

**Goals:**
  * **0.1: Business Value and Systems Up:** The point is to have a working real system. Tests exists to serve the working system. The system exists to serve the business. Business > Real System > Tests.
  * **0.2: User and Dev Experience:** User chat works and first-time user experience work end-to-end.
  * **0.3: Staging Parity:** The staging environment works end-to-end.
  * **0.4: Configuration Stability:** Configurations are coherent and tested across all environments.

**IMPORTANT: In the case of conflict between existing state of code and this document, this document wins.**

CRUCIAL: ULTRA THINK DEEPLY.

## üèóÔ∏è CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION

> **‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY READING**: The **[User Context Architecture](./USER_CONTEXT_ARCHITECTURE.md)** is the authoritative guide to our Factory-based isolation patterns. This document explains how we ensure complete user isolation, eliminate shared state, and enable reliable concurrent execution for 10+ users. **READ THIS FIRST** before making any changes to execution engines, WebSocket events, or tool dispatchers.

Recent issues to be extra aware of:
1. Race conditions. Plan ahead and think about race conditions in all aspects of your code and refactors.
The system has a lot of async, websockets, and other patterns that require heavy awarness of this.
2. Solve for the 95% of cases first. Always make sure the breadth and coverage of those expected cases is ironclad before the 5%.
3. Limit volume of code and new features. Rather delete an ugly or overbearing test then add a ton of code just to satisfy it. Always think of the whole system.
4. This is a multi-user system.
5. Update tests to SSOT methods. NEVER re-create legacy code to pass old tests!
6. **üö® CRITICAL CONFIG/ENV REGRESSION PREVENTION:** See [OAuth Regression Analysis](./OAUTH_REGRESSION_ANALYSIS_20250905.md) and [Config Regression Prevention Plan](./CONFIG_REGRESSION_PREVENTION_PLAN.md)
Configuration SSOT ‚â† Code SSOT: Environment-specific configs (TEST/STAGING/PROD) are NOT duplicates
   - **NEVER delete config without dependency checking** - Missing OAuth credentials caused 503 errors
   - **Each environment needs INDEPENDENT config** - Test/staging/prod MUST have separate OAuth credentials  
   - **NO silent fallbacks** - Hard failures are better than wrong environment configs leaking
   - **Strict SSOT enforcement** - BUT provide migration paths and test credentials
   - **Config changes = CASCADE FAILURES** - One missing env var can break entire flow 
  7. The system is MULTI-USER.

### Related Architecture Documents:
- **[User Context Architecture](./USER_CONTEXT_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Factory patterns and execution isolation (START HERE)
- **[Agent Architecture Disambiguation Guide](./docs/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE_DISAMBIGUATION_GUIDE.md)** - Clarifies complex agent workflow architecture and relationships

- [WebSocket Modernization Report](./WEBSOCKET_MODERNIZATION_REPORT.md) - WebSocket isolation implementation
- [Documentation Hub](./docs/index.md) - Central documentation index

Expect everything to fail. Add conditional error logging by default whenever possible.
Success is "quiet" and summarized. ANTHING that's not what's expected must be super obvious in logs.
Make all errors loud.
Protect against silent errors. Avoid "fallbacks" unless expressly part of named design and class.

## 1\. The Business Mandate: Value Capture and Growth

Netra Apex succeeds by creating and capturing value from a customer's AI spend.

**IMPORTANT: Core Business Principles:**

  * **Product-Market Fit:** Make Apex indispensable for customers managing AI infrastructure.
  * **Value Capture:** Capture a significant percentage of the value Apex creates.
  * **Customer Segments:** Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise. The goal of the Free tier is conversion to paid tiers.
  * **Prioritization:** Business goals drive engineering priorities. Rigor enables long-term business velocity.
  * **Lean Development (MVP/YAGNI):** Adhere strictly to Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and "You Ain't Gonna Need It" (YAGNI) principles. Every component MUST justify its existence with immediate business value.
  * **AI Leverage:** Use the AI Factory and specialized agent workflows as force multipliers to automate and augment processes, maximizing throughput and quality.
  * **COMPLETE YOUR TASKS FULLY** You always "finish the job" even when it takes many hours of work, sub agents, many tools or tasks.
  * **User Chat is King - SUBSTANTIVE VALUE** The user "Chat" means the COMPLETE value of AI-powered interactions. Because chat is currently the how we deliver 90% of our value. The current sub-focus is on the web UI/UX websocket based channel.

### 1.1. **"Chat" Business Value** 
  * **Real Solutions** Agents solving REAL problems, providing insights, and delivering actionable results. Technical send/receive of messages is one part of that whole.
  * **Helpful** The Chat UI/UX/Backend interconnections must be responsive, useful and strong. Success is measured by the substance and quality of AI responses.
  * **Timely** When a user is running an agent they must get timely updates AND receive meaningful, problem-solving results.  Some agents run slower or faster than others. Updates must be reasonable and contextually useful.
  * **Complete Business Value** Users must get complete readable responses, the end to end flow of agents must work.
  * **Data Driven** A large part of our value comes from the data driven.
  * **Business IP** We must protect our IP so messages to the users must protect "secrets" of how the agents work.

  The system must make sense for the default flows expected for business value. Business value > Abstract system purity.

### 1.2. Revenue-Driven Development: Business Value Justification (BVJ)

Every engineering task requires a Business Value Justification (BVJ) to align technical work with business outcomes. A BVJ must account for revenue and strategic value (e.g., Platform Stability, Development Velocity, Risk Reduction). Think like Elon Musk. Like Steve Jobs. Like Bill Gates.

**BVJ Structure:**

1.  **Segment:** (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise, or Platform/Internal)
2.  **Business Goal:** (e.g., Conversion, Expansion, Retention, Stability)
3.  **Value Impact:** (How does this improve the customer's AI operations?)
4.  **Strategic/Revenue Impact:** (The quantifiable or strategic benefit to Netra Apex.)

-----

## 2\. Engineering Principles: Modularity, Clarity, and Cohesion

CRITICAL: Develop a globally coherent and modular architecture. 
**Globally correct is better than locally correct.** Systems must be stable by default.

### 2.1. Architectural Tenets

  * **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each module, function, and agent task must have one clear purpose.
  * **Single Source of Truth (SSOT):** **CRITICAL:** A concept must have ONE canonical implementation per service. Avoid multiple variations of the same logic; extend existing functions with parameters instead. (Cross-service duplication may be acceptable for independence; see `SPEC/acceptable_duplicates.xml`).
    - **‚ö†Ô∏è CONFIG SSOT WARNING:** SSOT for config is DIFFERENT! See [Config Regression Prevention](./CONFIG_REGRESSION_PREVENTION_PLAN.md#core-problems-identified)
    - **NEVER blindly consolidate "duplicate" configs** - They may serve different environments/services
    - **Check ConfigDependencyMap BEFORE deleting** - One deletion can break multiple services
    - **Environment isolation is CRITICAL** - Test configs must NOT leak to staging/production
  * **"Search First, Create Second":** Always check for existing implementations before writing new code.
  * **ATOMIC SCOPE:** Edits must be complete, functional updates. Delegate tasks to sub-agents with scopes you are certain they can handle. Split and divide work appropriately.
  * **Complete Work:** An update is complete only when all relevant parts of the system are updated, integrated, tested, validated, and documented, and all legacy code has been removed.
  * **RANDOM FEATURES ARE FORBIDDEN:** Edits must focus on the most minimal change required to achieve the goal.
  * **BASICS FIRST:** Prioritize basic and expected user flows over exotic edge cases.
  * **LEGACY IS FORBIDDEN:** Always remove ALL related legacy code as part of any refactoring effort.
  * **Evolutionary Architecture:** Design systems to meet *current* needs while allowing for future adaptation (Just-in-Time Architecture).
  * **Operational Simplicity:** Favor architectures with fewer moving parts to reduce maintenance costs.
  * **High Cohesion, Loose Coupling:** Group related logic together while maximizing module independence.
  * **Interface-First Design:** Define clear interfaces and contracts before implementation.
  * **Composability:** Design components for reuse.
  * **Stability by Default:** Changes must be atomic. Explicitly flag any breaking changes.

Use Test Runner to discover tests e.g. `python tests/unified_test_runner.py` (absolute path: `/Users/anthony/Documents/GitHub/netra-apex/tests/unified_test_runner.py`). Read testing xmls.

**A compliance checklist against these tenets MUST be saved after every work session.**

### 2.2. Complexity Management

  * **Architectural Simplicity (Anti-Over-Engineering):** Assume a finite complexity budget. Every new service, queue, or abstraction must provide more value than the complexity it adds. Strive for the fewest possible steps between a request's entry point and the business logic.
  * **"Rule of Two":** Do not abstract or generalize a pattern until you have implemented it at least twice.
  * **Code Clarity:** Aim for concise functions (\<25 lines) and focused modules (\<750 lines). Exceeding these is a signal to re-evaluate for SRP adherence.
  * **Mega Class Exceptions:** Central SSOT classes defined in [`SPEC/mega_class_exceptions.xml`](SPEC/mega_class_exceptions.xml) may extend to 2000 lines with explicit justification. These must be true integration points that cannot be split without violating SSOT principles.
  * **Task Decomposition:** If a task is too large or complex, decompose and delegate it to specialized sub-agents with fresh contexts. ALWAYS carefully manage your own context use and agents context use.

### 2.3. Code Quality Standards

  * **Type Safety:** Adhere strictly to `SPEC/type_safety.xml`.
  * **Environment:** All environment access MUST go through `IsolatedEnvironment` as defined in [`SPEC/unified_environment_management.xml`](SPEC/unified_environment_management.xml).
  * **Configuration Architecture:** Follow the comprehensive configuration system documented in [`docs/configuration_architecture.md`](docs/configuration_architecture.md).
  * **Compliance Check:** Run `python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py` to check status.

### 2.4. Strategic Trade-offs

You are authorized to propose strategic trade-offs (e.g., accepting temporary complexity to ship a critical feature). Justify these in the BVJ, including the risks and a plan to address the resulting technical debt.

### 2.5. Observability and Data-Driven Operations

  * **The Three Pillars:** Implement comprehensive logging, metrics, and distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) across all services.
  * **SLOs:** Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for all critical services.
  * **Error Budgets:** Use error budgets to balance velocity with stability. If an SLO is breached, development focus MUST shift to restoring stability.

### 2.6. Pragmatic Rigor and Resilience

  * **Pragmatic Rigor:** Apply standards intelligently to ensure correctness, not rigidly for theoretical purity. Avoid architectural overkill.
  * **"Boring Technology":** Favor proven, operationally simple technologies.
  * **Resilience by Default:** Default to a functional, permissive state. Add strictness only where explicitly required (e.g., security). Adhere to Postel's Law: "Be conservative in what you send, liberal in what you accept."

-----

## 3\. The Development Process: Structured Analysis and Agent Utilization

### 3.1. The AI-Augmented "Complete Team"

Leverage specialized AI agents for distinct roles to maximize parallelism and analytical depth.

  * **Principal Engineer:** Strategy, architecture, final synthesis, and coordination.
  * **Product Manager (PM) Agent:** Defines the "Why" and "What." Refines requirements and drafts the BVJ.
  * **Design Agent:** Defines the user experience, workflows, and API ergonomics.
  * **Implementation Agent:** Executes focused coding tasks against a defined interface.
  * **QA/Security Agent:** Defines test strategy, analyzes regressions, and performs security audits.

### 3.2. Structured Analysis Phases (Pre-Implementation)

Before coding, conduct a rigorous analysis.

  * **Phase 0: Product Definition (PM/Design Agent):** If requirements are ambiguous, spawn agents to define user scenarios, validate the BVJ, and design workflows.
  * **Phase 1: Scenario Analysis (Principal/QA Agent):** Analyze happy paths, edge cases, security implications, and system impacts.
  * **Phase 2: Interface Contract Verification (Principal):** Deconstruct and verify the proposed architecture, data structures, and API contracts.
  * **Phase 3: Regression Impact Analysis (QA Agent):** Identify and analyze potential side effects on the unified system and define the testing scope.

### 3.3. Implementation Strategy

  * **Modular Implementation:** Delegate tasks to Implementation Agents one module at a time.
  * **Isolation (The "Firewall" Technique):** **CRITICAL:** When delegating, provide agents ONLY with the necessary interfaces of dependencies, not their full implementation context. This enforces contracts and prevents context bleed.
  * **Testing Focus:** Focuse on as real tests as possible by default. Most tests must assume inter-service nature by default. **Real Everything (LLM, Services) E2E \> E2E \> Integration \> Unit.**
  CRITICAL: Mocks = Abomination
  * **Test Architecture:** See [`tests/TEST_ARCHITECTURE_VISUAL_OVERVIEW.md`](tests/TEST_ARCHITECTURE_VISUAL_OVERVIEW.md) for complete test infrastructure guide
  * **Integration and Reporting:** You are responsible for integrating all artifacts and reporting on overall success.

### 3.4. Multi-Environment Validation

Code is not "done" until it is validated in environments that mirror production. Local E2E tests MUST use real services (local databases, shared LLMs). Mocks are forbidden in E2E testing.

**Mandatory Validation Pipeline:**

1.  **Local/CI:** Fast feedback with unit and integration tests.
2.  **Development:** Integration/E2E tests against deployed services.
ALWAYS use real services for testing. If they appear to not be available start or restarting them. If that too fails then hard fail the entire test suite.

### 3.5. MANDATORY BUG FIXING PROCESS:

EACH AGENT MUST SAVE THEIR WORK TO A JOINT BUG FIX REPORT for each bug.
The work is only complete when ALL DoD items are complete and the report is updated. SLOW DOWN. Think step by step.

At every opportunity spawn new subagent with dedicated focus mission and context window.
1.  **WHY:** Analyze why the code diverges from requirements. Why did existing tests miss this? MUST USE FIVE WHYS METHOD? Why? Why? Why!!!?
2.  **Prove it:** Write out TWO Mermaid diagrams. One of the ideal working state and one of the current failure state. Save your work the .md file. Write a test that reproduces the bug.
3.  **Plan system wide claude.md compaliant fix**  Think about ALL associated and related modules that must also be updated. Think about cross system impacts of bug. SLOWLY think DEEPLY about the implications. What is the spirit of the problem beyond the literal one-off problem? Plan the fix. Save to the bugfix .md.
4.  **Verification and proof implementation worked** QA review and regression testing. Use fail fast, starting with proving that newly created test suite now passes, then rest of tests related to this issue. repeat until all tests pass or 100 times.

### 3.6. MANDATORY COMPLEX REFACTORING PROCESS:

**CRITICAL: For any refactoring involving inheritance, multiple classes, or SSOT consolidation:**

**See Also:** 
- [`docs/GOLDEN_AGENT_INDEX.md`](docs/GOLDEN_AGENT_INDEX.md) for comprehensive agent implementation patterns and migration guidance.
- [`docs/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE_DISAMBIGUATION_GUIDE.md`](docs/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE_DISAMBIGUATION_GUIDE.md) for clarification on agent components and relationships.

1.  **MRO (Method Resolution Order) Analysis:** Generate a comprehensive MRO report BEFORE refactoring:
    - Document current inheritance hierarchy using `inspect.getmro()` or equivalent
    - Map all method overrides and their resolution paths
    - Identify potential diamond inheritance patterns
    - Save report to `reports/mro_analysis_[module]_[date].md`

2.  **Dependency Impact Analysis:**
    - Trace all consumers of classes being refactored
    - Document which methods/attributes each consumer uses
    - Identify breaking changes and required adaptations
    - Cross-reference with [`SPEC/learnings/ssot_consolidation_20250825.xml`](SPEC/learnings/ssot_consolidation_20250825.xml)

3.  **Agent-Based Decomposition:** For complex refactors spanning 5+ files:
    - Spawn specialized refactoring agents with focused scope
    - Each agent handles ONE inheritance chain or module
    - Provide agents with MRO report and interface contracts only
    - See examples in [`SPEC/learnings/unified_agent_testing_implementation.xml`](SPEC/learnings/unified_agent_testing_implementation.xml)

4.  **Validation Checklist:**
    - [ ] All MRO paths documented and preserved or intentionally modified
    - [ ] No unintended method shadowing introduced
    - [ ] All consumers updated to new interfaces
    - [ ] Integration tests pass for all inheritance scenarios
    - [ ] Performance regression tests pass (inheritance lookup overhead)

**Example MRO Report Structure:**
```markdown
# MRO Analysis: [Module Name]
## Current Hierarchy
- BaseClass
  - IntermediateA (overrides: method1, method2)
    - ConcreteA1 (overrides: method2)
    - ConcreteA2 (overrides: method1, method3)
  - IntermediateB (overrides: method1, method3)
    - ConcreteB1 (overrides: method3)

## Method Resolution Paths
- ConcreteA1.method1 ‚Üí IntermediateA.method1
- ConcreteA1.method2 ‚Üí ConcreteA1.method2 (local override)
- ConcreteA1.method3 ‚Üí BaseClass.method3

## Refactoring Impact
- Breaking: method1 signature change affects 12 consumers
- Safe: method2 internal refactor, interface preserved
```

**Cross-Reference Learnings:**
- SSOT violations: [`SPEC/learnings/ssot_consolidation_20250825.xml`](SPEC/learnings/ssot_consolidation_20250825.xml)
- Agent examples: [`SPEC/learnings/unified_agent_testing_implementation.xml`](SPEC/learnings/unified_agent_testing_implementation.xml)
- WebSocket integration: [`SPEC/learnings/websocket_agent_integration_critical.xml`](SPEC/learnings/websocket_agent_integration_critical.xml)

-----

## 4\. Knowledge Management: The Living Source of Truth

The `SPEC/*.xml` files are the **living source of truth** for system architecture and learnings.

  * **Navigation:** Read [`LLM_MASTER_INDEX.md`](LLM_MASTER_INDEX.md) before searching for files or functionality.
  * **Iterative Discovery:** Specs must evolve. If analysis reveals a better solution, propose a spec improvement.
  * **Update Timing:** Review specs before work and update them immediately after validation.
  * **Learnings vs. Reports:** Learnings in `SPEC/*.xml` are permanent knowledge. Reports (`*.md`) are ephemeral work logs.

### 4.1. String Literals Index: Preventing Hallucination

This index is the SSOT for all platform-specific constants, paths, and identifiers to prevent LLM errors.

  * **Index File:** `SPEC/generated/string_literals.json`
  * **Query Tool:** `scripts/query_string_literals.py`

**Usage Requirements:**

1.  **ALWAYS Validate** literals before use, using either grep or: `python scripts/query_string_literals.py validate "your_string"` or if appropriate reading the document directly.
2.  **NEVER Guess** config keys or paths; query the index first.
3.  **UPDATE Index** after adding new constants: `python scripts/scan_string_literals.py`

-----

## 5\. Architecture and Conventions

### 5.1. Microservice Independence

All microservices MUST be 100% independent. See [`SPEC/independent_services.xml`](SPEC/independent_services.xml).

  * Main Backend (`/netra_backend/app`)
  * Auth Service (`/auth_service`)
  * Frontend (`/frontend`)

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION - Shared Libraries Pattern:**
Services MAY import from `/shared` for infrastructure libraries (like `shared.isolated_environment`).
These are NOT service boundary violations because they're pure utilities with no business logic - 
think of them as internal pip packages. See [`docs/shared_library_pattern.md`](docs/shared_library_pattern.md) 
for the simple "pip package test" to determine what belongs in `/shared`.

### 5.2. Naming Conventions

  * **"Agent":** Only for LLM-based sub-agents. **"Executor/Manager":** For infrastructure patterns **"Service":** For specialized processors. **Utility:** Descriptive names without suffixes.

### 5.3. Directory Organization

**Files MUST be placed in their designated locations.**

  * **Service-Specific Tests:** Each service has its own `tests/` directory (e.g., `/netra_backend/tests/`). **NEVER mix tests between services.**
  * **E2E Tests:** End-to-end tests go in `/tests/e2e/`.
  * **Test Framework:** Shared utilities go in `/test_framework/`.
  * **See [`SPEC/folder_structure_rules.md`](SPEC/folder_structure_rules.md) for full guidelines.**

### 5.4. Import Rules

**ABSOLUTE IMPORTS ONLY.**
  * **ALL Python files  use absolute imports** starting from the package root.
  * **NEVER use relative imports (`.` or `..`)** in any Python file, including tests.
  * See [`SPEC/import_management_architecture.xml`](SPEC/import_management_architecture.xml) for details.

## 6\. MISSION CRITICAL: WebSocket Agent Events (Infrastructure for Chat Value)

**CRITICAL: WebSocket events enable substantive chat interactions - they serve the business goal of delivering AI value to users.**

### 6.1. Required WebSocket Events for Substantive Chat Value

The following events MUST be sent during agent execution to enable meaningful AI interactions:

1. **agent_started** - User must see agent began processing their problem
2. **agent_thinking** - Real-time reasoning visibility (shows AI is working on valuable solutions)
3. **tool_executing** - Tool usage transparency (demonstrates problem-solving approach)
4. **tool_completed** - Tool results display (delivers actionable insights)
5. **agent_completed** - User must know when valuable response is ready

### 6.2. WebSocket Integration Requirements

**CRITICAL: When modifying ANY of these components, you MUST:**
- Run `python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`
- Verify ALL event types are sent
- Test with real WebSocket connections
- Never remove or bypass WebSocket notifications

**Key Integration Points:**
- `AgentRegistry.set_websocket_manager()` MUST enhance tool dispatcher
- `ExecutionEngine` MUST have WebSocketNotifier initialized
- `EnhancedToolExecutionEngine` MUST wrap tool execution
- See [`SPEC/learnings/websocket_agent_integration_critical.xml`](SPEC/learnings/websocket_agent_integration_critical.xml)

**For Complete Agent Implementation Patterns:**
- See [`docs/GOLDEN_AGENT_INDEX.md`](docs/GOLDEN_AGENT_INDEX.md) - The definitive guide to agent implementation
- See [`docs/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE_DISAMBIGUATION_GUIDE.md`](docs/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE_DISAMBIGUATION_GUIDE.md) - Comprehensive clarification of agent architecture
- See [`SPEC/learnings/agent_execution_order_fix_20250904.xml`](SPEC/learnings/agent_execution_order_fix_20250904.xml) - CRITICAL: Correct agent execution order (Data BEFORE Optimization)
- See [`AGENT_EXECUTION_ORDER_REASONING.md`](AGENT_EXECUTION_ORDER_REASONING.md) - Why execution order matters for business value

-----

## 7\. Project Tooling

### 7.1. Docker

**CRITICAL: All Docker operations go through the central UnifiedDockerManager.**
**See [`docs/docker_orchestration.md`](docs/docker_orchestration.md) for complete architecture and usage.**

#### Automatic Docker Management (Primary Usage)
```bash
# Tests use UnifiedDockerManager - just run:
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --real-services

# Docker starts automatically, conflicts are resolved, services are health-checked
```

#### Manual Docker Operations (When Needed)

"Refresh" local dev = for the relevant containers, remove the existing, create a new fresh image, deploy it

```bash
# Manual control script (uses central UnifiedDockerManager)
python scripts/docker_manual.py start     # Start test environment
python scripts/docker_manual.py stop      # Stop all containers  
python scripts/docker_manual.py restart   # Restart services
python scripts/docker_manual.py status    # Check status
python scripts/docker_manual.py clean     # Clean up everything
python scripts/docker_manual.py test      # Run tests with Docker

# Restart specific services
python scripts/docker_manual.py restart --services backend auth
```

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Conflict Resolution**: Removes conflicting containers automatically
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and reporting
- **Dynamic Port Allocation**: Avoids port conflicts in parallel runs
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

#### Alpine Container Support
**Optimized Alpine Docker images for 50% faster testing with minimal resource usage:**

The platform supports Alpine-based containers for dramatic performance improvements:

**Usage Examples:**

```bash
# Enable Alpine containers for tests (DEFAULT behavior)
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --real-services
# Alpine automatically used via use_alpine=True

# Force regular containers (if needed)
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --real-services --no-alpine

# Manual Docker operations with Alpine
python scripts/docker_manual.py start --alpine
python scripts/docker_manual.py status --alpine
```

**Alpine Compose Files:**
- `docker-compose.alpine-test.yml` - Test environment with named volumes (stable storage)
- `docker-compose.alpine.yml` - Development environment
- Alpine Dockerfiles: `docker/backend.alpine.Dockerfile`, `docker/auth.alpine.Dockerfile`, `docker/frontend.alpine.Dockerfile`

**When to Use Alpine:**
- **‚úì Test environments** (default choice for speed)
- **‚úì CI/CD pipelines** (faster builds, lower resource usage)
- **‚úì Development** (when memory is constrained)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING: tmpfs Storage Removed**
Docker tmpfs storage has been completely removed from the codebase as it causes system crashes due to RAM exhaustion. 
ALL Docker configurations now use named volumes for persistent, stable storage that doesn't consume system RAM.
Never re-introduce tmpfs mounts - they will crash the system.

**Performance Optimizations in Alpine:**
- **Minimal base images** (python:3.11-alpine3.19)
- **Resource limits** (prevents memory exhaustion)
- **Optimized configurations** (fsync=off for test DB)

#### Development Service Refresh
```bash
# Refresh backend and auth with latest changes
python scripts/refresh_dev_services.py refresh --services backend auth

# Quick restart without rebuild  
python scripts/refresh_dev_services.py restart --services backend

# Check status
python scripts/refresh_dev_services.py status

# View logs
python scripts/refresh_dev_services.py logs --services backend -f
```

### 7.3. Unified Test Runner

IMPORTANT: Use real services, real llm, docker compose etc. whenever possible for testing.
MOCKS are FORBIDDEN in dev, staging or production.

**See [`tests/TEST_ARCHITECTURE_VISUAL_OVERVIEW.md`](tests/TEST_ARCHITECTURE_VISUAL_OVERVIEW.md) for complete visual guide to test infrastructure, layers, and execution flows.**

**The test runner automatically starts Docker when needed:**

  * **Default (Fast Feedback):** `python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category integration --no-coverage --fast-fail`
  * **With Real Services:** `python tests/unified_test_runner.py --real-services` (Docker starts automatically)
  * **E2E Tests:** `python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category e2e` (Docker starts automatically)
  * **Before Release:** `python tests/unified_test_runner.py --categories smoke unit integration api --real-llm --env staging`
  * **Mission Critical Tests:** `python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`

#### Docker Environment Configuration
- **Test Environment (Default)**: PostgreSQL (5434), Redis (6381), Backend (8000), Auth (8081)
- **Development Environment**: PostgreSQL (5432), Redis (6379), Backend (8000), Auth (8081)
- **Production Environment**: Standard production ports

### 7.4. Deployment (GCP)

**Use ONLY the official deployment script.**
  * **Default:** `python scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py --project netra-staging --build-local`

If you ever have a chance to audit or verify or spawn new subagent, even if 10x as much work to improve 1% chance of overall success do it. Success = Complete work at all costs.

## 9\. Execution Checklist

### For Every Code Change:

1.  **Assess Scope:** Determine if specialized agents (PM, Design, QA, etc.) are required.
2.  **üö® CHECK CRITICAL VALUES:** Open [`MISSION_CRITICAL_NAMED_VALUES_INDEX.xml`](SPEC/MISSION_CRITICAL_NAMED_VALUES_INDEX.xml) - validate ALL named values!
    - **SPECIAL ATTENTION:** OAuth credentials, JWT keys, database URLs - see [OAuth Regression](./OAUTH_REGRESSION_ANALYSIS_20250905.md)
3.  **Review DoD Checklist:** Open [`DEFINITION_OF_DONE_CHECKLIST.md`](DEFINITION_OF_DONE_CHECKLIST.md) and identify your module's section.
4.  **Check Learnings:** Search recent [`learnings/index.xml`](SPEC/learnings/index.xml) and recent commit changes.
5.  **Verify Strings:** Validate literals with `scripts/query_string_literals.py`.
6.  **Review Core Specs:** Re-read [`type_safety.xml`](SPEC/type_safety.xml) and [`conventions.xml`](SPEC/conventions.xml).
7.  **Create New Test Suite:** Create a new test suite of difficult tests idealy failing tests.
8.  **Run Local Tests:** Run relevant tests for the scope of work done. Real services > mock.
9.  **Complete DoD Checklist:** Go through EVERY item in your module's checklist section.
10. **Update Documentation:** Ensure specs reflect the implemented reality.
11. **Refresh Indexes:** Update the string literal index if new constants were added.
12. **Update Status:** Regenerate and refresh reports .mds and learnings.
13. **Save new Learnings:** [`learnings/index.xml`](SPEC/learnings/index.xml).

### 9.1 Git Commit Standards.
**All commits follow [`SPEC/git_commit_atomic_units.xml`](SPEC/git_commit_atomic_units.xml).**
**Windows Unicode/emoji issues: See [`SPEC/windows_unicode_handling.xml`](SPEC/windows_unicode_handling.xml).**
A user asking for "git commit" means: For EACH group of work that's related do a commit. e.g. 1-10 commits as per need.
  * **GROUP CONCEPTS - LIMIT COUNT OF FILES:** Commits must be small, focused, and conceptually similar units.
  * **CONCEPT-BASED:** Group changes by concept. NEVER bulk commit massive changes without express orders.
  * **REVIEWABLE:** Each commit must be reviewable in under one minute.
  * **REFACTORING COMMITS:** Complex refactors MUST include MRO report reference in commit message

**Final Reminder:** ULTRA THINK DEEPLY. Your mission is to generate monetization-focused value. Prioritize a coherent, unified system that delivers end-to-end value for our customers. **Think deeply. YOUR WORK MATTERS. THINK STEP BY STEP AS DEEPLY AS POSSIBLE.**
