  - See **[UVS Triage Architecture Transition Guide](./docs/UVS_TRIAGE_ARCHITECTURE_TRANSITION.md)** for complete details
  - Data Intelligence Agent (formerly Data Helper) now PRIMARY agent handling 80% of requests
  - Intelligent data sufficiency states: Insufficient → Minimal → Sufficient → Optimal
  - Iterative data gathering until sufficient data achieved for analysis
- **Simplified Agent Hierarchy** - Reduced from 3 triage agents to 1 unified triage agent
- **Enhanced Data Processing** - Automatic data gathering when insufficient data detected

## 📊 Business Context

### Value Proposition
The Netra Apex AI Optimization Platform delivers AI optimization value across all customer segments by providing:

- **Cost Reduction**: 30-70% reduction in AI/LLM spending through intelligent model routing and optimization
- **Performance Improvement**: 40-60% improvement in response times through caching and batching strategies
- **Scale Enablement**: 10x scalability through efficient resource management
- **Progressive Value Delivery**: Immediate value even with partial data (40-60% optimization possible)

### Customer Segments & Data Handling

| Segment | Data Completeness | Value Delivery Strategy |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Free** | <40% (Insufficient) | Education + Quick templates + Value demonstration |
| **Early** | 40-79% (Partial) | Immediate wins + Progressive optimization + Data collection |
| **Mid** | 60-85% (Mostly complete) | Phased implementation + Quality preservation |
| **Enterprise** | 80-100% (Sufficient) | Full optimization + Compliance focus + Custom strategies |

### Adaptive Workflow Architecture

The platform implements **adaptive workflows** based on data completeness:

1. **Sufficient Data (≥80%)**: Full optimization workflow with high confidence
2. **Partial Data (40-79%)**: Modified workflow with caveats, immediate value, and progressive enhancement
3. **Insufficient Data (<40%)**: Focus on education, data collection, and value demonstration

See [Orchestration Data Handling Patterns](./reports/analysis/ORCHESTRATION_DATA_HANDLING_PATTERNS.md) for comprehensive patterns and examples.
See [Netra Optimization Breakdown](./reports/analysis/NETRA_OPTIMIZATION_BREAKDOWN.md) for detailed system optimization architecture (AI-specific vs general).

### Key Business Metrics

- **Conversion Rate**: Users providing data after initial insufficient data scenario
- **Value Delivery Rate**: Successful optimizations despite incomplete data
- **Confidence Accuracy**: Correlation between confidence scores and actual outcomes
- **Time to Value**: <24 hours for initial recommendations, 1-3 weeks for full implementation

## 🎯 Core System Design

The Netra Apex system implements a **Factory-based, request-scoped architecture** that ensures complete user isolation and eliminates shared state issues. See the **[User Context Architecture](./reports/archived/USER_CONTEXT_ARCHITECTURE.md)** for detailed diagrams and explanations.

### Key Components

#### 1. Execution Factory Pattern
- `ExecutionEngineFactory` - Creates per-request execution engines
- `WebSocketBridgeFactory` - Creates per-user WebSocket emitters  
- `ToolExecutorFactory` - Creates isolated tool dispatchers

#### 2. User Isolation
- `UserExecutionContext` - Complete request isolation
- `IsolatedExecutionEngine` - Per-request execution with no shared state
- `UserWebSocketEmitter` - User-specific event delivery

#### 3. Resource Management
- Per-user semaphores (max 5 concurrent executions)
- Memory thresholds (1024MB limit)
- Automatic cleanup and lifecycle management

- gcloud CLI (for GCP deployment)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/netra/netra-apex.git
cd netra-apex

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Initialize database (if needed)
python scripts/init_database.py

# Start the application (Docker recommended)
docker-compose up

# Alternative: Start services individually
python scripts/launch_backend.py
python scripts/launch_auth_service.py
npm --prefix frontend run dev
```

### 🚀 Quick Demo Launch

For a quick staging demo with automatic setup:

```bash
# Using Claude Code command (recommended)
/run-demo

# Or using the Python script directly
python scripts/staging_demo_setup.py --frontend gcp  # Use GCP frontend
python scripts/staging_demo_setup.py --frontend localhost  # Use local frontend
```

This command handles all setup including:
- GCP authentication
- Environment configuration
- Secret Manager access verification
- Service health checks
- Automatic browser launch

See [Staging Demo Setup Guide](./docs/STAGING_DEMO_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

**Note:** With Issue #420 resolution, staging environment provides complete validation coverage as alternative to local Docker setup.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

The system follows a multi-tier architecture with complete user isolation:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Frontend UI   │
├─────────────────┤
│   API Gateway   │
├─────────────────┤
│ Factory Layer   │ ← Creates isolated instances per request
├─────────────────┤
│ Execution Layer │ ← User-specific execution contexts
├─────────────────┤
│ Infrastructure  │ ← Shared, immutable resources
└─────────────────┘
```

For detailed architecture diagrams and explanations, see **[User Context Architecture](./reports/archived/USER_CONTEXT_ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## 🔒 Security

The system implements multiple security boundaries:

1. **Request Isolation** - Each request gets its own execution context
2. **User Isolation** - Complete separation between concurrent users
3. **Resource Limits** - Per-user semaphores and memory limits
4. **Permission Layers** - Tool execution permission checking
5. **Secure Cleanup** - Automatic resource cleanup on request completion
