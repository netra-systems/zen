# Basic System Functionality Test Report

**Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Environment:** Development  
**Test Duration:** ~15 seconds  

## Test Results Summary

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Auth Service Health Check | ✅ **PASSED** | Service healthy at http://localhost:8081/health |
| Service URL Alignment | ✅ **PASSED** | URLs properly configured, no port conflicts |
| Database URL Builder | ✅ **PASSED** | Credential masking and URL building working |
| Backend Health Check | ⚠️ **SKIPPED** | Backend service not responding (timeout) |
| WebSocket Connection | ⚠️ **SKIPPED** | Backend dependency not available |
| Database Connectivity | ❌ **FAILED** | Database "netra_dev" does not exist |

## Detailed Findings

### ✅ What's Working Well

1. **Auth Service (Port 8081)**
   - Health endpoint responding correctly
   - Returns proper JSON structure with status, service info, version, timestamp
   - Uptime: ~17,000+ seconds (service has been running stably)
   - Version: 1.0.0

2. **Configuration Management**
   - DatabaseURLBuilder functioning correctly
   - Environment variable isolation working
   - Service URL configuration aligned
   - Credential masking for security working properly

3. **Network Configuration**
   - No port conflicts detected
   - Service URLs properly formatted
   - TCP configuration detected correctly

### ⚠️ Services Not Available

1. **Backend Service (Port 8000)**
   - Connection timeouts (10s timeout exceeded)
   - Health endpoint not responding
   - May be starting up or not currently running

2. **WebSocket Service**
   - Multiple endpoints tested: `/ws`, `/ws/test`, `/websocket`
   - All endpoints unreachable (backend dependency)

### ❌ Issues Found

1. **Database Connectivity**
   - PostgreSQL server is running on localhost:5433
   - Database "netra_dev" does not exist
   - Connection parameters are correct
   - This is a setup/initialization issue, not a connectivity problem

## Environment Analysis

**Database Configuration:**
- Host: localhost
- Port: 5433 (non-standard)
- Database: netra_dev (not created yet)
- User: postgres
- Connection validation: ✅ Valid configuration

**Service URLs:**
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- Auth Service: http://localhost:8081

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Backend Service**
   - Check if backend service is running
   - If not running, start backend service
   - If timing out, increase startup time or check logs

2. **Database Setup**
   - Create the "netra_dev" database
   - Run database initialization scripts
   - Consider using: `python database_scripts/create_db.py` (requires POSTGRES_PASSWORD)

3. **Full System Test**
   - Once backend is running, WebSocket tests should pass
   - Once database is created, database connectivity should pass

### System Health Assessment

**Current State:** Partially functional
- **Auth Service:** Fully operational ✅
- **Configuration:** Working correctly ✅
- **Backend Service:** Not running ⚠️
- **Database:** Server running, database not created ❌

**Critical Path:** Backend service startup is the main blocker for full functionality testing.

## Test Methodology

The test suite validates:
1. **Basic connectivity** to each service
2. **Health endpoint responses** and JSON structure validation
3. **Database URL building and masking** for security
4. **WebSocket connection capability** (when backend available)
5. **Cross-service configuration alignment**

Tests are designed to gracefully handle missing services and provide actionable diagnostics rather than failing fast.

## Technical Details

**Environment Detection:**
- Environment: development
- Test mode: e2e_testing
- Configuration source: IsolatedEnvironment
- Database URL: `postgresql+asyncpg://***@localhost:5433/netra_dev`

**Success Criteria:**
- Health endpoints return 200 with valid JSON
- Database URLs properly formatted and secured
- Services use distinct ports
- Configuration validation passes

The test framework properly handles missing services and provides useful diagnostic information for system administrators to identify and resolve issues.
