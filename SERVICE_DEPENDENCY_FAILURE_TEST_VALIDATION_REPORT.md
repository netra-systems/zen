    service_name: str
    state: ServiceState
    response_time_ms: float
    error_rate: float
    success_rate: float
    # ... additional metrics

@dataclass
class FallbackMechanism:
    name: str
    trigger_condition: str
    fallback_service: str
    expected_degradation: str
    recovery_condition: str

@dataclass
class RetryPolicy:
    max_attempts: int
    initial_delay_ms: int
    max_delay_ms: int
    exponential_base: float = 2.0
    circuit_breaker_threshold: int = 5
```

#### ✅ **Sophisticated Helper Methods**
- `_test_session_management_with_redis()` - Real Redis/PostgreSQL testing
- `_simulate_connection_exhaustion()` - Realistic connection pool testing
- `_test_llm_api_with_timeouts()` - Advanced retry logic testing
- `_perform_comprehensive_health_check()` - Real service health validation
- `_calculate_system_resilience_score()` - Holistic system assessment

### 4. SSOT Compliance Validation

#### ✅ **Proper Imports**
```python
from test_framework.base_integration_test import BaseIntegrationTest
from test_framework.real_services_test_fixtures import real_services_fixture
from test_framework.ssot.e2e_auth_helper import E2EAuthHelper, create_authenticated_user_context
```

#### ✅ **Real Services Usage**
- Uses `real_services_fixture` for all database operations
- Creates real users via `create_authenticated_user_context`
- NO MOCKS - all service interactions use real connections
- Proper error handling when services unavailable

#### ✅ **Business Value Validation**
```python
def assert_business_value_delivered(self, result: Dict, expected_value_type: str):
    """Assert that test result delivers actual business value."""
    # Validates automation, insights, cost_savings business value
```

### 5. File Location and Structure

#### ✅ **Correct Location**
```
netra_backend/tests/integration/golden_path/test_comprehensive_service_dependency_failures.py
```

#### ✅ **Proper Test Structure**
- Extends `BaseIntegrationTest`
- Uses `setup_method()` for initialization
- All test methods properly decorated with `@pytest.mark.integration` and `@pytest.mark.real_services`
- Comprehensive docstrings with business justification
