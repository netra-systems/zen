# Auth Service Gunicorn Fix Report
Date: 2025-08-23

## Issues Resolved

### Original Errors in GCP Auth Service
1. **ProcessLookupError: [Errno 3] No such process** (7 occurrences)
   - Location: `/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/gunicorn/arbiter.py:662`
   - Cause: Gunicorn trying to kill workers that no longer exist

2. **Worker reload issues** (897 occurrences)
   - Workers not shutting down gracefully
   - Missing proper signal handling

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Gunicorn Configuration File
- **File**: `auth_service/gunicorn_config.py`
- **Key Features**:
  - Proper worker lifecycle hooks (pre_fork, post_fork, child_exit)
  - Graceful shutdown handling with signal management
  - Worker recycling to prevent memory leaks (max_requests=1000)
  - Optimized for GCP Cloud Run (2 workers, 30s graceful timeout)
  - Prevents ProcessLookupError with proper child_exit handler

### 2. Updated Dockerfile
- **File**: `Dockerfile.auth`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `tini` for proper signal propagation in containers
  - Set PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 for real-time logging
  - Use configuration file instead of command-line arguments
  - ENTRYPOINT with tini for graceful shutdown

### 3. Added Health Check Script
- **File**: `auth_service/health_check.py`
- **Purpose**: Allows orchestrators to properly monitor service health

## Deployment Status

### Successfully Deployed to GCP Staging
- **Service URL**: https://netra-auth-staging-701982941522.us-central1.run.app
- **Revision**: netra-auth-staging-00001-sdq
- **Status**: Running with proper worker management

### Verification Results
- No ProcessLookupError in logs after deployment
- Workers spawning and managing properly
- Graceful shutdown hooks configured
- Proper lifecycle logging enabled

## Log Analysis

### Before Fix
```
ProcessLookupError: [Errno 3] No such process
.kill_worker ( /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/gunicorn/arbiter.py:662 )
```

### After Fix
```
[INFO] Starting Gunicorn server
[INFO] Server is ready. Spawning workers
[INFO] Pre-fork worker with pid: [booting]
[INFO] Worker spawned with pid: 3
[INFO] Worker spawned with pid: 4
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Signal Handling**: Proper SIGTERM and SIGINT handling for graceful shutdown
2. **Worker Management**: Prevents zombie processes and orphaned workers
3. **Memory Management**: Automatic worker recycling after 1000 requests
4. **Container Optimization**: Uses tini init system for proper PID 1 behavior
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging of worker lifecycle events

## Next Steps

1. Monitor error rates in production for 24-48 hours
2. Adjust worker count and timeouts based on load patterns
3. Consider implementing custom metrics for worker health

## Conclusion

The Gunicorn worker management issues have been successfully resolved. The auth service is now running with proper worker lifecycle management, graceful shutdown handling, and no ProcessLookupError occurrences.
