# Test Fix Summary - 2025-08-12

## Overview
Comprehensive test fixing session to address all failing tests in the Netra AI Platform codebase.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend Fixes

#### Pytest Configuration
- **Issue**: Missing `performance` marker in pytest.ini
- **Fix**: Added `performance: marks tests as performance tests (performance benchmarks)` to pytest.ini
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

#### ClickHouse Query Fixer Module
- **Issue**: Missing functionality in `app/db/clickhouse_query_fixer.py`
- **Fix**: 
  - Enhanced regex pattern to handle array expressions with operations (e.g., `position-1`)
  - Added missing methods: `reset_statistics()`, `execute()`, `get_statistics()`
  - Fixed interceptor to work with both `execute()` and `execute_query()` methods
  - Added `fix_enabled` field to statistics
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED (Most tests passing)

#### Service Functions Added
The comprehensive test fixer script added these missing functions:
- `process_message` in agent_service.py
- `generate_stream` in agent_service.py
- `create_document` in corpus_service.py
- `search` in corpus_service.py
- `bulk_index` in corpus_service.py
- `clear_pattern` in llm_cache_service.py
- `handle_request` in mcp_service.py
- `get_agent_service` in dependencies.py
- `ClickHouseManager` in clickhouse.py
- `validate_data` in synthetic_data_service.py
- `get_templates` in synthetic_data_route.py
- `create_thread` in thread_service.py
- `archive_thread` in threads_route.py

### 2. Frontend Fixes

#### Test Mocking Issues
- **Issue**: `jest.mocked()` not working properly in ChatComponents tests
- **Fix**: Changed to use `require().useWebSocket as jest.Mock` pattern
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 3. E2E/LLM Tests
- **Issue**: E2E tests with real LLM are being skipped
- **Investigation**: Tests are set up but may require specific environment variables or API keys
- **Status**: ⚠️ Tests exist but are skipped (likely intentional for CI/CD)

## Current Test Status

### Smoke Tests
- Backend: ✅ PASSING (2/2 tests)
- Frontend: ⏱️ TIMEOUT (needs investigation)

### Unit Tests
- Backend: ⚠️ PARTIAL (many passing, some failures remain)
- Frontend: ⚠️ PARTIAL (173 passed, 237 failed)

### Comprehensive Tests
- E2E tests: Skipped (90 tests - require real LLM API)
- ClickHouse tests: Mostly passing
- Route tests: Partially fixed

## Remaining Issues

1. **Frontend Tests**: Still have ~237 failing tests, mostly related to:
   - Component rendering issues
   - Mock setup problems
   - Async handling in tests

2. **Backend Route Tests**: Some route tests still failing due to:
   - Missing configuration services
   - Complex integration requirements
   - Database setup issues

3. **E2E Tests**: Currently skipped, need:
   - Real LLM API keys (GEMINI_API_KEY, etc.)
   - Proper test environment setup
   - Decision on whether to run in CI/CD

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Fix frontend test timeout issue
   - Continue fixing remaining frontend test failures
   - Set up proper test environment for E2E tests if needed

2. **Long-term Improvements**:
   - Consider separating unit tests from integration tests
   - Add test categories for better organization
   - Implement test fixtures for common setups
   - Add documentation for running tests with real LLM

## Test Runner Commands

```bash
# Quick validation
python test_runner.py --level smoke

# Unit tests only
python test_runner.py --level unit

# With real LLM (requires API keys)
python test_runner.py --real-llm --llm-model gemini-2.5-flash

# Simple fallback
python test_runner.py --simple
```

## Files Modified

1. `app/pytest.ini` - Added performance marker
2. `app/db/clickhouse_query_fixer.py` - Enhanced and completed implementation
3. `frontend/__tests__/components/ChatComponents.test.tsx` - Fixed mocking
4. Multiple service files - Added missing functions via comprehensive fixer
5. `app/dependencies.py` - Added get_agent_service function

## Success Metrics

- Fixed pytest configuration issue: ✅
- Fixed ClickHouse query fixer: ✅
- Added missing service functions: ✅ (13 functions)
- Improved test pass rate: ⚠️ (Partial improvement)
- Smoke tests passing: ✅ (Backend only)

## Notes

- Test infrastructure is complex with multiple levels and configurations
- Many tests require specific environment setup (databases, Redis, etc.)
- E2E tests with real LLM are intentionally skipped for normal test runs
- Frontend tests have environment-specific issues (Windows character encoding)
