# Auth Service Staging Audit Report
**Date:** August 23, 2025  
**Environment:** GCP Staging (netra-staging)  
**Service:** netra-auth-service

## Executive Summary
The auth service in GCP staging is experiencing critical startup failures due to missing required environment variables. The service is unable to initialize and returns 503 Service Unavailable on all endpoints.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Required Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** The auth service requires `SERVICE_SECRET` and `SERVICE_ID` environment variables for enhanced JWT security in staging/production environments.

**Error Message:**
```
ValueError: SERVICE_SECRET must be set in production/staging
  File "/app/auth_service/auth_core/config.py", line 51, in get_service_secret
```

**Impact:** 
- Service cannot start
- All health checks fail
- Service returns 503 on all endpoints
- No authentication functionality available

### 2. Incomplete Secret Configuration
**Current Secrets Configured:**
- ✅ DATABASE_URL (database-url-staging)
- ✅ JWT_SECRET_KEY (jwt-secret-staging)  
- ✅ GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID (google-client-id-staging)
- ✅ GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET (google-client-secret-staging)

**Missing Secrets:**
- ❌ SERVICE_SECRET (required for enhanced JWT security)
- ❌ SERVICE_ID (required for service instance identification)

### 3. Worker Process Failures
**Pattern:** Continuous worker process crashes in gunicorn/uvicorn initialization
- Workers fail to load WSGI application
- Process crashes during config initialization (auth_service/auth_core/config.py:51)
- Gunicorn arbiter continuously restarts failed workers

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause
The auth service code was updated to require additional security parameters (`SERVICE_SECRET` and `SERVICE_ID`) for production/staging environments, but the deployment configuration was not updated to provide these values.

### Contributing Factors
1. **Deployment Script Gap:** The `deploy_to_gcp.py` script doesn't include SERVICE_SECRET and SERVICE_ID in:
   - Secret creation (setup_secrets function)
   - Cloud Run environment variable mapping

2. **Config Validation:** The auth service correctly validates environment requirements but fails hard in staging without proper fallback.

## Service Status
- **Latest Revision:** netra-auth-service-00024-7tx (Ready but failing)
- **Traffic:** 100% to latest revision
- **Health Status:** 503 Service Unavailable
- **Container Status:** Healthy (passes Cloud Run health checks but app fails internally)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0)
1. **Create Missing Secrets in GCP Secret Manager:**
   ```bash
   # Create SERVICE_SECRET
   echo -n "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" | gcloud secrets create service-secret-staging --data-file=- --project=netra-staging
   
   # Create SERVICE_ID  
   echo -n "netra-auth-staging-$(date +%s)" | gcloud secrets create service-id-staging --data-file=- --project=netra-staging
   ```

2. **Update Cloud Run Service Configuration:**
   ```bash
   gcloud run services update netra-auth-service \
     --region=us-central1 \
     --update-secrets="SERVICE_SECRET=service-secret-staging:latest,SERVICE_ID=service-id-staging:latest"
   ```

### Short-term Actions (P1)
1. **Update deployment script** (`scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py`):
   - Add SERVICE_SECRET and SERVICE_ID to secrets setup
   - Include in Cloud Run deployment command

2. **Add monitoring alerts** for service startup failures

### Long-term Actions (P2)
1. **Implement staged rollout** with automatic rollback on health check failures
2. **Add pre-deployment validation** to ensure all required secrets exist
3. **Document secret requirements** in deployment documentation

## Verification Steps
After implementing fixes:
1. Check service health: `curl https://netra-auth-service-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app/health`
2. Verify logs: `gcloud logging read "resource.labels.service_name=netra-auth-service" --limit=10`
3. Test authentication flow through frontend

## Compliance Notes
- The service correctly enforces security requirements for production environments
- Missing secrets indicate proper security validation is working
- No sensitive data was exposed in logs (only configuration errors)

## Timeline
- **Issue Start:** Likely since recent deployment with enhanced JWT security requirements
- **Detection:** August 23, 2025, 22:12 UTC
- **Impact Duration:** Ongoing until SERVICE_SECRET and SERVICE_ID are configured

## Conclusion
The auth service staging deployment is failing due to missing required security configuration. This is a configuration issue, not a code issue. The service code correctly enforces security requirements. Immediate action is needed to create and map the missing secrets to restore service functionality.
