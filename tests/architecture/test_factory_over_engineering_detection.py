"""
Phase 1: Factory Discovery and Classification Tests
Issue #1194 - Factory Over-Engineering Remediation

Purpose:
Comprehensive tests to discover, classify, and validate removal of over-engineered factory classes
while preserving essential factory patterns that provide genuine business value.

Test Design:
- Scans entire codebase for factory classes
- Classifies by complexity metrics and usage patterns
- Identifies over-engineering candidates for removal
- Validates business value justification for each factory

Business Impact: $500K+ ARR protection through architectural simplification
SSOT Compliance: Identifies duplicate factory patterns and consolidation opportunities

These tests are designed to FAIL initially to demonstrate the current over-engineering problem.
