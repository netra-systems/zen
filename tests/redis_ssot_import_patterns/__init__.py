"""Redis SSOT Import Pattern Tests



MISSION: Validate Redis import pattern compliance to protect $500K+ ARR chat functionality.



This module contains comprehensive tests for Redis SSOT import pattern migration:



1. test_redis_import_pattern_compliance.py - Static code analysis for import patterns

2. test_import_pattern_migration_e2e.py - End-to-end migration functionality validation  

3. test_cross_service_import_consistency.py - Cross-service import consistency validation



CRITICAL PROTECTIONS:

- Golden Path chat functionality preservation during migration

- User isolation maintenance across Redis operations

- Service boundary respect with shared Redis infrastructure

- Connection pool conflict prevention



These tests ensure safe migration of Redis imports to SSOT pattern without breaking

the core business value delivery through chat functionality.
