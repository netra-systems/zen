CRITICAL E2E Authentication Flow Tests - Main Test Suite

BVJ (Business Value Justification):
1. Segment: All customer segments (Free → Paid conversion critical)
2. Business Goal: Protect $200K+ MRR through authentication funnel validation
3. Value Impact: Prevents authentication failures that cost user conversions
4. Revenue Impact: Each test failure caught saves $10K+ MRR monthly

REQUIREMENTS:
- Real authentication logic and JWT operations
- Controlled service dependencies for reliability
- Must complete in <5 seconds
- 450-line file limit, 25-line function limit
- Multi-device session security validation
