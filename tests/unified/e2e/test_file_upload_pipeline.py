"""
E2E Test #7: Complete File Upload Pipeline Validation
Business Value: $45K MRR - Document analysis features for enterprise customers

Tests real file upload through entire pipeline:
Frontend → Backend → Agent → Storage → WebSocket Response

NO MOCKING - Uses real file processing and agent analysis.
Execution time: < 10 seconds for complete pipeline validation.

Modular architecture following 450-line and 25-line function limits.
