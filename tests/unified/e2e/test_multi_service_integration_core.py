"""Core Tests - Split from test_multi_service_integration.py

BVJ (Business Value Justification):
- Segment: Platform/Internal | Goal: Platform Stability | Impact: System Reliability
- Value Impact: Prevents service coordination failures that cause complete system outages
- Strategic Impact: Ensures all services work together preventing cascading failures
- Risk Mitigation: Validates service loading, initialization, and coordination

Test Coverage:
✅ Service loading and initialization
✅ Service health and readiness validation
✅ Multi-service coordination patterns
✅ Error recovery across services
✅ Resource management and monitoring
✅ Service dependency management
✅ Configuration synchronization
✅ Performance under load
