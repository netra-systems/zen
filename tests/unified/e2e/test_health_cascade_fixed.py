"""Service Health Cascade Test - Simplified Implementation

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Enterprise  
- Business Goal: System resilience ensuring $30K+ MRR protection
- Value Impact: Validates health check propagation, graceful degradation, and recovery
- Revenue Impact: Prevents cascading failures that could lose enterprise customers

Simplified version that focuses on testing health cascade behavior without complex service orchestration.
Tests against already-running services.
