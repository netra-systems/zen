"""E2E Test #10: Health Monitoring Auto-Recovery - Operational Excellence

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
1. Segment: Enterprise & Mid-tier customers 
2. Business Goal: Operational efficiency and system resilience
3. Value Impact: Prevents service outages through automated recovery
4. Revenue Impact: Protects $15K+ MRR through reduced downtime and operational costs

ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE:
- File size: <300 lines (modular design)
- Function size: <8 lines each
- Real service instances, auto-recovery validation
- <30 seconds total execution time
- Validates health monitoring and <2 minute auto-recovery
