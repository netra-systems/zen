CRITICAL E2E Payment Upgrade Flow Tests - Revenue Protection Test Suite

BVJ (Business Value Justification):
1. Segment: Free → Paid conversion (100% of new revenue generation)
2. Business Goal: Protect complete payment and tier upgrade pipeline
3. Value Impact: Validates $99-999/month per user conversion flow
4. Revenue Impact: Each test failure caught prevents $10K+ MRR loss

REQUIREMENTS:
- Complete user journey: signup → payment → tier upgrade
- Real authentication and JWT operations
- Mock payment provider integration (Stripe simulation)
- Billing record creation in ClickHouse
- Premium feature activation validation
- Performance validation (<30 seconds total)
- 450-line file limit, 25-line function limit

This test protects 100% of new revenue generation. Without this test passing,
we cannot convert free users to paid, which is the entire business model.
