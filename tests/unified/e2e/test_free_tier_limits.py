"""
CRITICAL E2E Test #7: Free Tier Limit Enforcement → Upgrade Prompt
Business Value: $300K+ MRR - Free-to-paid conversion through strategic limit enforcement

BVJ (Business Value Justification):
1. Segment: Free → Paid conversion (100% of new revenue generation)
2. Business Goal: Optimize conversion timing at moment users see value
3. Value Impact: Well-timed limits convert 25-35% free users to paid
4. Revenue Impact: Each conversion = $348-3588/year in recurring revenue

REQUIREMENTS:
- Free user hits daily/request limits (10 requests/day)
- Further requests blocked with contextual upgrade prompt
- Upgrade prompt shows pricing and value proposition
- User completes upgrade to paid tier
- Limits removed immediately post-upgrade
- Service resumes normal operation
- Performance validation (<30 seconds total)
- 450-line file limit, 25-line function limit

This test protects the entire free-to-paid conversion funnel.
Without effective limit enforcement, free users never convert.
