"""Fixtures Tests - Split from test_auth_backend_integration.py

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
Segment: Enterprise (Critical security infrastructure for all tiers)
Business Goal: Zero authentication failures across service boundaries 
Value Impact: Enables secure multi-service architecture for Enterprise customers
Revenue Impact: $50K+ MRR per enterprise client requiring security compliance

Tests JWT token flow between Auth service (port 8001) and Backend (port 8000):
- Token generation in Auth service
- Token validation in Backend service  
- User data synchronization between services
- Session management consistency
- Cross-service authentication failures

CRITICAL: Uses REAL services with actual HTTP calls - NO MOCKS
