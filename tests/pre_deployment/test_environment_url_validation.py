Pre-Deployment Environment URL Validation Tests



PURPOSE: Validate service URLs match expected environment patterns before deployment

CONTEXT: Process Improvement - Would have caught localhost:8081 in staging issue

BUSINESS IMPACT: Protects $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality from environment config errors



These tests MUST PASS before any staging/production deployment.

Designed to catch the specific root cause: localhost URLs being used in Cloud Run environments.
