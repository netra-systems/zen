# Failing Test Gardener Worklog - Critical Tests - 2025-09-14 11:59:30

## Test Focus: CRITICAL

This worklog documents critical test failures discovered during automated testing and the GitHub issues created to track their resolution.

## Execution Summary

**Date:** 2025-09-14 11:59:30  
**Test Focus:** critical  
**Tests Executed:**
- `python3 tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`
- `python3 tests/unified_test_runner.py --category mission_critical --fast-fail` (timed out due to Docker issues)

## Issues Discovered

### 1. WebSocket Agent Event Structure Validation Failures (Critical)

**Test:** `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`  
**Status:** 3 critical failures out of 42 tests  
**Severity:** P1 (High - major feature broken)  
**Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR - Core chat functionality affected

#### Failing Tests:
1. `TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_agent_started_event_structure` - Event structure validation failed
2. `TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_tool_executing_event_structure` - Missing `tool_name` field
3. `TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_tool_completed_event_structure` - Missing `results` field

#### Technical Details:
- WebSocket connection to staging successful: `wss://netra-backend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app/api/v1/websocket`
- Tests are receiving `connection_established` events instead of expected agent events
- Event structure validation is failing due to missing required fields
- All tests use real WebSocket connections (no mocks)

#### Error Messages:
```
AssertionError: agent_started event structure validation failed
AssertionError: tool_executing missing tool_name
AssertionError: tool_completed missing results
```

### 2. Docker Infrastructure Build Failures (Blocking)

**Test:** `tests/unified_test_runner.py --category mission_critical`  
**Status:** Complete failure - timed out  
**Severity:** P1 (High - blocking test execution)  
**Business Impact:** Test infrastructure unusable for Docker-dependent tests

#### Technical Details:
- Docker build failure in `backend.alpine.Dockerfile:69`
- Failed to compute cache key during COPY operation
- Multiple recovery attempts failed (3/3 attempts)
- Suggestion: Docker disk space may be full (`docker system prune -a`)

#### Error Pattern:
```
failed to solve: failed to compute cache key: failed to compute cache key for /Users/anthony/Desktop/netra-apex/netra_backend
```

### 3. SSOT WebSocket Manager Violations (Warning - Monitoring)

**Test:** All WebSocket-related tests  
**Status:** Warning level  
**Severity:** P2 (Medium - architectural debt)  
**Business Impact:** Potential future SSOT compliance issues

#### Technical Details:
- Multiple WebSocket Manager classes detected (SSOT violation)
- Classes found: `WebSocketManagerMode`, `WebSocketManagerProtocol`, etc.
- Currently at WARNING level, may escalate to blocking

## Action Items

Each issue will be processed through GitHub issue creation/updates via sub-agents:

1. **WebSocket Event Structure Issues** → ✅ **UPDATED** existing Issue #1021 with latest test results and worklog reference
2. **Docker Build Infrastructure** → ✅ **UPDATED** existing Issue #1082 with priority escalation P2→P1  
3. **SSOT WebSocket Violations** → ✅ **UPDATED** existing Issue #885 with latest violation details and escalation risk analysis

## GitHub Issue Actions Completed

### 1. WebSocket Event Structure Validation Failures - ✅ UPDATED

**Issue:** #1021 - "CRITICAL: WebSocket Event Structure Validation Failures - Golden Path Blocker"  
**Action Taken:** Updated existing comprehensive issue with latest test execution results  
**Status:** P0 Critical - Actively being worked on  
**Links Added:** 
- Worklog reference: `tests/FAILING-TEST/FAILING-TEST-GARDENER-WORKLOG-critical-2025-09-14-115930.md`
- Agent session label: `agent-session-2025-09-14-1159`
- Latest test execution confirmation with identical failure pattern

**Why Updated Instead of New:** Issue #1021 already comprehensively covers the exact same failing tests:
- `test_agent_started_event_structure` - Event structure validation failed
- `test_tool_executing_event_structure` - Missing `tool_name` field  
- `test_tool_completed_event_structure` - Missing `results` field

The existing issue contains detailed technical analysis, expected vs actual behavior, related issues, and success criteria. Adding the latest test execution results maintains continuity and avoids duplicate tracking.

### 2. Docker Infrastructure Build Failures - ✅ UPDATED

**Issue:** #1082 - "failing-test-regression-p2-docker-alpine-build-infrastructure-failure"  
**Action Taken:** Updated existing issue with priority escalation from P2 to P1 and latest failure context  
**Status:** P1 High - Major feature broken (mission critical test execution blocked)  
**Priority Escalation:** P2 → P1 due to mission critical test timeout blocking $500K+ ARR functionality validation  

**Key Updates Added:**
- Latest test execution failure: `tests/unified_test_runner.py --category mission_critical --fast-fail` TIMED OUT
- Identical error pattern confirmation: Docker build cache key computation failure
- Business impact escalation: Mission critical tests completely blocked
- Context from Issue #420 strategic resolution explaining why this differs from general Docker P3 priority
- Recovery attempts status: 3/3 failed, requires `docker system prune -a`
- Related issues linking: #878 (P0 disk space), #420 (P3 strategic resolution)
- Worklog reference: `tests/FAILING-TEST/FAILING-TEST-GARDENER-WORKLOG-critical-2025-09-14-115930.md`

**Why Updated Instead of New:** Issue #1082 already covers the exact same Docker Alpine build failure:
- Same Dockerfile line 69: `COPY --chown=netra:netra netra_backend /app/netra_backend`
- Same cache key computation error pattern
- Same ports conflicts (5432, 6379) and disk space recommendations

The priority escalation from P2 to P1 reflects the business impact: when Docker failures block mission critical tests (not just nice-to-have integration tests), this becomes a major feature broken scenario rather than moderate infrastructure dependency.

### 3. SSOT WebSocket Manager Violations - ✅ UPDATED

**Issue:** #885 - "failing-test-ssot-medium-websocket-manager-fragmentation"  
**Action Taken:** Updated existing P2 issue with latest violation detection results from 2025-09-14  
**Status:** P2 Medium - SSOT compliance issue with escalation monitoring  
**Links Added:** 
- Worklog reference: `tests/FAILING-TEST/FAILING-TEST-GARDENER-WORKLOG-critical-2025-09-14-115930.md`
- Agent session label: `agent-session-2025-09-14-1159`
- Latest violation detection logs with exact timestamps
- Escalation risk analysis (WARNING level → potential blocking)

**Why Updated Instead of New:** Issue #885 already comprehensively covers SSOT WebSocket manager violations:
- Same violation classes: `WebSocketManagerMode`, `WebSocketManagerProtocol`, `WebSocketManagerProtocolValidator`
- Same affected files: `/netra_backend/app/websocket_core/websocket_manager.py`, etc.
- Same priority level (P2) appropriate for architectural debt monitoring

**Key Updates Added:**
- Latest violation detection: 2025-09-14 11:57:29 with exact log timestamps
- Current SSOT compliance context: 84.4% system-wide (333 violations)
- Escalation risk analysis: WARNING level requiring monitoring before blocking
- Business impact clarification: WebSocket supports 90% of platform value
- Related issues cross-referencing: Links to P0 WebSocket issues (#1060, #1100)
- CLAUDE.md compliance requirements: SSOT mandatory within each service
- Success criteria updated with WARNING elimination focus

The updated issue now reflects current system state and provides clear escalation prevention strategy with appropriate P2 priority for architectural debt monitoring.
