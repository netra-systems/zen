Unit Tests for WebSocket Docker Infrastructure Configuration Failures (Issue #315)

These tests DELIBERATELY FAIL to demonstrate the 3 critical issues:
1. Service naming mismatch between Docker compose and code expectations
2. Missing docker_startup_timeout attribute in RealWebSocketTestConfig
3. Docker file path mismatch (docker/ vs dockerfiles/)

Business Impact: These failures block validation of chat functionality (90% platform value)
protecting $500K+ ARR. The WebSocket infrastructure is critical for real-time AI interactions.
