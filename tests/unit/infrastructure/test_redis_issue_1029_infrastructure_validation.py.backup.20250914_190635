Unit Test: Redis Issue #1029 Infrastructure Validation

MISSION CRITICAL: This test suite validates Redis infrastructure configuration patterns
that prevent GCP Memory Store connectivity failures causing the timeout issues
identified in Issue #1029.

Root Cause Context:
- GCP staging should use Memory Store Redis endpoint, not localhost
- Configuration fallbacks to localhost cause infrastructure connectivity failures
- Environment-specific Redis configuration must be validated
- GCP Secret Manager integration must be properly configured

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Configuration Stability & Error Prevention
- Value Impact: Prevents Redis configuration issues that break chat functionality
- Strategic Impact: Ensures proper GCP Memory Store Redis configuration for $500K+ ARR

CLAUDE.md Compliance:
- Unit tests focus on configuration logic, not Redis operations
- Tests validate environment-specific configuration patterns
- No Redis connection testing (handled in integration/e2e tests)
- Tests designed to fail when configuration is incorrect

Test Design: DESIGNED TO FAIL INITIALLY
These tests should FAIL initially to demonstrate Issue #1029 infrastructure problems.
