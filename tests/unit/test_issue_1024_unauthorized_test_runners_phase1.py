Phase 1: Unit Tests for Issue #1024 - Unauthorized Test Runners Blocking Golden Path

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform (All segments depend on test reliability)
- Business Goal: Stability - Ensure Golden Path test reliability >95%
- Value Impact: Protects $500K+ ARR by ensuring consistent test infrastructure
- Revenue Impact: Prevents deployment blocks and development velocity loss

CRITICAL PURPOSE: These tests are DESIGNED TO FAIL initially to demonstrate
the unauthorized test runner problem blocking Golden Path deployment.

Test Strategy:
1. Detect SSOT compliance violations in test infrastructure
2. Identify unauthorized pytest.main() bypasses
3. Find standalone test runners violating unified test runner SSOT
4. Quantify Golden Path reliability impact
