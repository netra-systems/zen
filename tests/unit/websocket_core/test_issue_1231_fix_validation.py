Issue #1231 Fix Validation Tests

These tests validate that the async/await bug fix works correctly.

BUG FIX: Remove 'await' from get_websocket_manager() calls in websocket_ssot.py

These tests should PASS after the fix is applied and FAIL before the fix.

Business Impact RESTORATION:
- WebSocket connections restored
- Golden Path user flow functional
- Real-time messaging working
- $500K+ ARR dependency restored
- 90% of platform value restored

Test Focus:
- Synchronous WebSocket manager creation
- Proper factory pattern operation
- Connection establishment success
- Event delivery restoration
- Golden Path flow validation

Expected Results:
- BEFORE FIX: Tests should FAIL
- AFTER FIX: Tests should PASS
