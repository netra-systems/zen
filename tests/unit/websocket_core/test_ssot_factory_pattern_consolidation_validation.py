"""
SSOT WebSocket Manager Factory Pattern Consolidation Validation Test

This test validates that WebSocket manager factory patterns are properly consolidated
and follow SSOT principles without duplicate factory implementations.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: These tests should FAIL initially to prove factory fragmentation exists.
After SSOT refactor (Step 4), they should PASS with consolidated factory patterns.

Business Value: Platform/Internal - System Architecture Compliance
Ensures consolidated factory patterns for WebSocket management, preventing code duplication.

Test Strategy: Static analysis and runtime factory validation (no Docker dependencies).
Unit test approach - creates instances to validate factory behavior.
