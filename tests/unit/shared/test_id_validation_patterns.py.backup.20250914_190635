UNIT TESTS - ID Validation Pattern Bug Reproduction and Fix Validation

These tests specifically target the WebSocket user ID validation bug where the pattern
"e2e-staging_pipeline" fails to match existing validation patterns.

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: Platform/Internal  
- Business Goal: Bug Fix & System Reliability
- Value Impact: Prevents WebSocket connection failures for deployment users
- Strategic Impact: Ensures consistent ID validation across all environments

ROOT CAUSE: Missing regex pattern ^e2e-[a-zA-Z]+-[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ in validation logic

CRITICAL BUG CONTEXT:
- Issue: WebSocket error "Invalid user_id format: e2e-staging_pipeline"
- Location: shared/types/core_types.py:336 and netra_backend/app/core/unified_id_manager.py:716-732
- GitHub Issue: https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/105

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: 
- Test 1 & 2: MUST FAIL initially (proving bug exists)
- Test 3-5: MUST PASS (proving regression protection)
