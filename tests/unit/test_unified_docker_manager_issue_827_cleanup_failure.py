"""
Unit tests for Issue #827 Docker Resource Cleanup Failure.

Tests the specific Windows Docker Desktop pipe communication failures that occur
during graceful shutdown operations in the UnifiedDockerManager.

Test Plan Implementation - Business Impact: Protecting $500K+ ARR infrastructure
Target: UnifiedDockerManager.graceful_shutdown() method lines 3662-3672

Error Pattern: Windows Docker Desktop pipe communication failures:
- "open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified"
- Connection errors during docker-compose shutdown operations
- Graceful degradation and fallback to force_shutdown

This test suite should initially FAIL to prove it detects Issue #827 error patterns.
