Test Plan for Issue #502: UserExecutionContext Import Syntax Validation



Business Value Justification (BVJ):

- Segment: Platform Infrastructure  

- Business Goal: Ensure test infrastructure stability

- Value Impact: Prevent test collection failures that block development

- Strategic Impact: Core testing capability for golden path validation



CRITICAL: This test validates the syntax fix for Issue #502 where a broken import

statement in the golden path test file was preventing test collection.
