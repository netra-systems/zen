"""
Unit tests to validate auth service timeout remediation (Issue #395).

VALIDATION TARGET: Verify 1.5s timeout provides 87% buffer utilization for GCP Cloud Run.
These tests SHOULD PASS to demonstrate the timeout remediation is successful.

Key Validation Points:
1. 1.5s staging health check timeout provides adequate buffer for 0.195s response
2. Environment variable configuration works correctly
3. Circuit breaker timeouts are properly aligned
4. Buffer utilization monitoring provides actionable insights
