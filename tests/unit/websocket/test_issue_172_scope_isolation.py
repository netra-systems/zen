Test for Issue #172: WebSocket Race Condition with state_registry (scope isolation)

This test reproduces the variable scope isolation bug where state_registry 
is not properly initialized in function scope, causing NameError exceptions
and 100% connection failures.

Business Impact: $500K+ ARR chat functionality blocked
Issue: Variable scope isolation causing undefined state_registry
Root Cause: Improper variable initialization in WebSocket endpoint scope

CRITICAL: These tests should FAIL until Issue #172 is fixed.
