"""
Redis Manager Consolidation Unit Test - CRITICAL for GitHub Issue #190

This test validates that the 4‚Üí1 Redis manager consolidation works correctly,
ensuring single Redis manager handles all operations and preventing the chaos
of 76 files importing different Redis managers.

BUSINESS IMPACT: CRITICAL - $500K+ ARR at risk
- Chat functionality failures from Redis connection instability
- Agent state persistence issues causing 1011 WebSocket errors
- Memory leaks from multiple Redis connection pools
- User isolation failures from competing Redis managers

CURRENT STATE (Expected to FAIL until consolidation complete):
- PRIMARY SSOT: /netra_backend/app/redis_manager.py (734 lines)
- VIOLATION 1: /netra_backend/app/db/redis_manager.py
- VIOLATION 2: /netra_backend/app/cache/redis_cache_manager.py  
- VIOLATION 3: /auth_service/redis_manager.py
- 76 files importing different Redis managers creating chaos

CONSOLIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Single Redis manager handles all operations (connection, caching, health checks)
2. Connection pool sharing works across components
3. Configuration consistency maintained across all services
4. Memory usage reduced vs multiple managers
5. All Redis operations (get/set/delete/ping/health) work through single manager
6. User isolation properly maintained with factory patterns
