Unit Tests for Issue #358: Component-Level Golden Path Failures



CRITICAL ISSUE: Complete system lockout preventing users from accessing AI responses

BUSINESS IMPACT: $500K+ ARR at risk due to complete user path blockage



These tests are DESIGNED TO FAIL to prove the critical issues exist and demonstrate

the business impact of the Golden Path failure modes identified in comprehensive analysis.



Test Categories:

1. HTTP API RequestScopedContext AttributeError reproduction

2. DEMO_MODE configuration detection failures  

3. WebSocket subprotocol format validation failures



Business Value Justification (BVJ):

- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise, Platform) 

- Business Goal: System Stability & Revenue Protection

- Value Impact: Prevent complete system lockout affecting $500K+ ARR

- Strategic Impact: Validate critical user execution paths work correctly



REQUIREMENTS per CLAUDE.md:

- MUST NOT require Docker (unit tests)

- MUST FAIL initially to prove issues exist

- Follow SSOT testing patterns

- Focus on business impact validation

- Use IsolatedEnvironment for configuration
