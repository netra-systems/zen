Shared Golden Path Unit Tests: Cross-Service Business Logic



Tests shared business logic components that support the golden path

across all services, including type safety, ID generation, and

shared utilities without external dependencies.



Business Value:

- Validates shared business logic consistency across services

- Tests type safety and ID generation for business operations

- Verifies shared utilities support business requirements

- Tests cross-service integration patterns and contracts
