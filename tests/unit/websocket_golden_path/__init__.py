WebSocket Golden Path Unit Tests Package



This package contains comprehensive unit tests for the most critical WebSocket SSOT classes

that enable the Golden Path user flow: connection  ->  authentication  ->  message routing  ->  agent execution.



Business Value: These tests protect $500K+ ARR chat functionality by validating:

- Connection success rates (WebSocket Manager)

- Message routing accuracy (Message Handlers) 

- User isolation enforcement (Connection Handler)

- Agent execution integration (Agent Handler)

- Authentication security (WebSocket Authentication)



SSOT Compliance: All tests inherit from SSotBaseTestCase and use SSotMockFactory.
