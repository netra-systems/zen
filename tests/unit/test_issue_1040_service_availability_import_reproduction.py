Issue #1040 ServiceAvailability Import Failure Reproduction Test

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal (enabling all segments)
- Business Goal: Restore $500K+ ARR protection through SSOT compliance
- Value Impact: Unblock critical startup and memory leak tests
- Revenue Impact: Critical - test infrastructure stability affects all revenue segments

Purpose: This test reproduces the exact import failure experienced by mission-critical tests.

Expected Behavior:
- FAILS before fix: ImportError when trying to import from SSOT location
- PASSES after fix: Successful import from SSOT location with correct enum values
