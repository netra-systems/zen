Test ExecutionState Enum Consistency - SSOT Validation

=====================================================



Business Value Justification (BVJ):

- Segment: Platform Infrastructure - Critical for all tiers

- Business Goal: System Stability - Prevent execution state fragmentation

- Value Impact: Ensures consistent execution state tracking across all modules

- Strategic Impact: $500K+ ARR depends on reliable agent execution state management



This test validates that all ExecutionState enums across the codebase are consistent

and follow SSOT principles. ExecutionState fragmentation leads to:

1. Silent agent failures when states don't match

2. WebSocket event delivery failures

3. Execution tracking inconsistencies

4. User experience degradation (no AI responses)



CRITICAL: This test will FAIL before SSOT remediation and PASS after consolidation.
