"""WebSocket Manager SSOT Implementation Scanner Test - Issue #1036

FAIL-FIRST TEST: This test is designed to FAIL before SSOT consolidation
and PASS after WebSocket Manager implementations are consolidated to a single SSOT.

Business Value: Protects $500K+ ARR by preventing WebSocket fragmentation that causes
Golden Path failures, user isolation breaches, and chat functionality degradation.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- BEFORE SSOT: Test FAILS - Multiple implementations found (WebSocketManager, UnifiedWebSocketManager, etc.)
- AFTER SSOT: Test PASSES - Only 1 canonical implementation remains

This test validates Issue #1036 Step 2: 20% new SSOT tests detecting fragmentation.
