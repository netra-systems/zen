Test to Reproduce OAuth Configuration Naming Bug



This test specifically reproduces the OAuth configuration bug where:

1. Backend service lacks OAuth configuration entirely  

2. Tests expect simplified OAuth naming (GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID) but it doesn't exist

3. Missing GSM mappings for simplified OAuth names

4. Missing oauth category in backend service secrets



This test is designed to FAIL initially, demonstrating the bug, then PASS after fix.



Created: 2025-09-07 as part of mandatory bug fixing process per CLAUDE.md section 3.5
