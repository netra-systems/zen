Unit Tests for Auth Validation Timeout Issue Reproduction - GitHub Issue #265

MISSION CRITICAL: These tests MUST FAIL initially to prove the auth validation 
timeout issue exists in staging environments.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
- Auth validation timeout hardcoded to 5.0s for GCP environments
- Staging cold starts require 8+ seconds for auth system readiness
- Missing graceful degradation bypass for staging environment
- File: netra_backend/app/websocket_core/gcp_initialization_validator.py:149,152

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Blocks WebSocket connections during staging cold starts
- Prevents Golden Path user flow validation ($500K+ ARR protection)
- Causes 1011 WebSocket errors in staging environment

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: System Stability & Chat Value Delivery  
- Value Impact: Eliminates auth timeout blocking WebSocket connections
- Strategic Impact: Enables reliable staging environment validation

Test Requirements:
- These tests MUST FAIL when run against current code
- Tests validate the issue exists before implementing fixes
- Uses SSOT test infrastructure patterns
- NO DOCKER dependencies - unit tests only
