GitHub Issue #117 - WebSocket Bridge Integration Failures Reproduction Test Suite

CRITICAL: This test suite is designed to FAIL initially - it reproduces the incomplete
WebSocket bridge integration causing agent execution to fail without WebSocket events.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise) - WebSocket events enable chat value
- Business Goal: Restore WebSocket event delivery during agent execution
- Value Impact: Users cannot see agent progress without WebSocket events
- Strategic Impact: Prevents $120K+ MRR loss from broken chat experience

Test Strategy: FAILING TESTS FIRST
These tests are EXPECTED TO FAIL initially, reproducing the exact bridge integration gaps.
After AgentWebSocketBridge is properly connected to ExecutionEngine, these tests should PASS.
