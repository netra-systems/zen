Infrastructure Tests for Issue #485

This module contains tests specifically designed to validate and resolve
test infrastructure issues identified in Issue #485 - Golden Path Test 
Infrastructure Missing Context.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform Infrastructure  
- Business Goal: Ensure reliable test infrastructure for $500K+ ARR protection
- Value Impact: Reliable test execution enables business continuity validation
- Strategic Impact: Foundation for all other business value validation

Test Categories:
- Import Path Resolution Tests: Validate reliable module imports
- Unified Test Runner Collection Tests: Validate test discovery and collection
- Business Value Protection Tests: Validate capability to protect $500K+ ARR
- Existing Functionality Protection Tests: Ensure no regressions during fixes

Expected Test Behavior:
- Phase 1-3 Tests: Should INITIALLY FAIL to demonstrate the issues
- Phase 4 Tests: Should INITIALLY PASS to validate regression protection  
- After Fixes: All tests should PASS

Business Value Impact:
These tests protect the foundation of our test infrastructure which enables
validation of the $500K+ ARR business value through reliable testing.
