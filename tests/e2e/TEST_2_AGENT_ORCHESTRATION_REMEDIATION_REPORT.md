## 🚀 Key Implementation Details

### 1. Real Service Integration (NO MOCKS)
```python
# Real LLM Manager
llm_manager = LLMManager(
    deployment_type="development",
    context=execution_context
)

# Real WebSocket Manager
websocket_manager = WebSocketManager()

# Real Database Sessions
session = get_real_db_session()

# Real Tool Dispatcher with WebSocket enhancement
tool_dispatcher = ToolDispatcher()
```

### 2. WebSocket Event Validation
All 5 critical events are validated:
- `agent_started` - User sees agent began processing
- `agent_thinking` - Real-time reasoning visibility
- `tool_executing` - Tool usage transparency
- `tool_completed` - Tool results display
- `agent_completed` - User knows when done

### 3. Comprehensive Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Complex Multi-Agent Orchestration
```python
request = {
    "message": "Analyze our ML training infrastructure costs and optimize for 40% reduction",
    "context": {
        "current_spend": "$50K/month",
        "gpu_instances": 20,
        "training_jobs": 150
    }
}
# Validates complete flow through multiple agents with real cost optimization
```

#### Scenario 2: Multi-Turn Context Preservation
```python
# Turn 1: Initial analysis
# Turn 2: Add compliance constraints
# Turn 3: Request migration plan
# Validates context preservation across all turns
```

#### Scenario 3: Error Recovery
```python
# Inject agent timeout
# Inject tool failure
# Inject partial agent failure
# Validates graceful recovery with 66% success rate
```
