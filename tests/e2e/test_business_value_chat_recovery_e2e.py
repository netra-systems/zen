"""
E2E Test: Business Value Chat Recovery Patterns - MISSION CRITICAL Resilience Validation

BUSINESS IMPACT: Tests chat recovery patterns that maintain business value during edge cases.
This validates system resilience that protects revenue during service degradation or errors.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Enterprise/Platform - Service Reliability  
- Business Goal: Revenue Protection - Maintain value delivery during degradation
- Value Impact: Validates graceful degradation that preserves customer experience
- Strategic Impact: Tests resilience patterns that prevent customer churn during issues

CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS:
✅ Graceful degradation maintains partial business value
✅ Error recovery preserves user session and context
✅ Fallback patterns deliver alternative value when primary fails
✅ User experience remains positive during service issues
✅ Business insights still delivered despite technical challenges

RECOVERY PATTERNS TESTED:
• Connection recovery - Reconnect and resume chat sessions
• Agent failure recovery - Alternative approaches when agents fail
• Partial response recovery - Extract value from incomplete responses  
• Service degradation - Maintain core functionality during slowdowns
• Context preservation - Maintain user state across recovery scenarios

COMPLIANCE:
@compliance CLAUDE.md - Resilience by default (Section 2.6)
@compliance CLAUDE.md - E2E AUTH MANDATORY (Section 7.3)
@compliance CLAUDE.md - Business value preservation during failures
@compliance SPEC/core.xml - Error handling and recovery patterns
