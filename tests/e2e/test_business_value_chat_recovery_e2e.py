E2E Test: Business Value Chat Recovery Patterns - MISSION CRITICAL Resilience Validation



BUSINESS IMPACT: Tests chat recovery patterns that maintain business value during edge cases.

This validates system resilience that protects revenue during service degradation or errors.



Business Value Justification (BVJ):

- Segment: Enterprise/Platform - Service Reliability  

- Business Goal: Revenue Protection - Maintain value delivery during degradation

- Value Impact: Validates graceful degradation that preserves customer experience

- Strategic Impact: Tests resilience patterns that prevent customer churn during issues



CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS:

 PASS:  Graceful degradation maintains partial business value

 PASS:  Error recovery preserves user session and context

 PASS:  Fallback patterns deliver alternative value when primary fails

 PASS:  User experience remains positive during service issues

 PASS:  Business insights still delivered despite technical challenges



RECOVERY PATTERNS TESTED:

[U+2022] Connection recovery - Reconnect and resume chat sessions

[U+2022] Agent failure recovery - Alternative approaches when agents fail

[U+2022] Partial response recovery - Extract value from incomplete responses  

[U+2022] Service degradation - Maintain core functionality during slowdowns

[U+2022] Context preservation - Maintain user state across recovery scenarios



COMPLIANCE:

@compliance CLAUDE.md - Resilience by default (Section 2.6)

@compliance CLAUDE.md - E2E AUTH MANDATORY (Section 7.3)

@compliance CLAUDE.md - Business value preservation during failures

@compliance SPEC/core.xml - Error handling and recovery patterns
