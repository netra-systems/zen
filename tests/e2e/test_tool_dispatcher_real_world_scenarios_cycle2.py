E2E Tests for Tool Dispatcher Real World Scenarios - Cycle 2

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
- Business Goal: Validate tool dispatcher works in real-world customer scenarios
- Value Impact: Users get reliable AI-powered analysis results in production environment
- Strategic Impact: Real-world validation ensures platform delivers promised business value

CRITICAL: Real-world scenarios validate that customers will actually receive value.
These tests represent the actual customer experience that drives revenue.

E2E AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENT: All tests MUST use real authentication per CLAUDE.md

                - 15 different data sources with varying schemas
                - Real-time processing requirements
                - Compliance with 7 different regulatory frameworks
                - Budget constraints requiring 40% cost reduction
                
                Please provide comprehensive analysis with specific recommendations.
