CLAUDE.md COMPLIANT: Agent Event Sequence Validation with MANDATORY Authentication



This test suite validates the 5 CRITICAL WebSocket events that enable substantive AI interactions,

using REAL authentication as mandated by CLAUDE.md Section 6.



Business Value Justification:

- Segment: Platform/Internal (Core Infrastructure) - Protects $500K+ ARR chat functionality  

- Business Goal: Ensure 100% reliability of critical WebSocket events for AI value delivery

- Value Impact: Validates event ordering, timing, and content that enables optimal chat UX

- Strategic Impact: Prevents event sequence failures that cause user frustration and churn



CLAUDE.md Section 6 - MISSION CRITICAL: WebSocket Agent Events Requirements:

 PASS:  agent_started - User must see agent began processing their problem

 PASS:  agent_thinking - Real-time reasoning visibility (shows AI working on valuable solutions)  

 PASS:  tool_executing - Tool usage transparency (demonstrates problem-solving approach)

 PASS:  tool_completed - Tool results display (delivers actionable insights)

 PASS:  agent_completed - User must know when valuable response is ready



CLAUDE.md COMPLIANCE:

 PASS:  ALL e2e tests MUST use authentication (JWT/OAuth) - MANDATORY

 PASS:  Real services only - NO MOCKS allowed (ABOMINATION if violated)

 PASS:  Tests fail hard - no bypassing/cheating (ABOMINATION if violated)

 PASS:  Use test_framework/ssot/e2e_auth_helper.py (SSOT) for authentication

 PASS:  Focus on business-critical WebSocket infrastructure for chat value delivery



PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:

- First event (agent_started): <100ms from request

- Total event sequence: <45s for complete agent execution

- Event ordering: Strict sequence validation for optimal UX

- Event content: Meaningful progress updates for user engagement
