GCP Staging Health Endpoint Timeout Failures Test Suite

These tests replicate the CRITICAL health endpoint issues identified in the GCP staging logs:

IDENTIFIED ISSUES FROM STAGING LOGS:
1. **CRITICAL: Health Endpoint Returns 503 with 5+ Second Timeout**
   - /health endpoint timing out and returning 503 Service Unavailable
   - 5+ second response times before failure
   - Health checks blocking on external dependencies
   - Load balancer health probes failing

2. **CRITICAL: Health Endpoints Block on External Dependencies**
   - Health checks waiting for ClickHouse, Redis, or other services
   - Non-essential services causing health check failures
   - Cascade failures when external services are down
   - Health checks not designed for staging environment constraints

EXPECTED TO FAIL: These tests demonstrate current health endpoint reliability issues
These are failing tests that replicate actual staging issues to aid in debugging.

Root Causes to Investigate:
- Health checks not properly isolated from external dependencies
- Timeout configurations too aggressive for staging environment
- External services (ClickHouse, Redis) not available in staging
- Health check logic not environment-aware
- Database connection pools exhausted during health checks
- Synchronous blocking calls in health check endpoints
