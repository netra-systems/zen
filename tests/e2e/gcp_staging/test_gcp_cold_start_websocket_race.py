"""
E2E tests for GCP cold start WebSocket race condition reproduction.

MISSION CRITICAL: Tests the actual race condition in GCP Cloud Run environment
that causes 1011 WebSocket errors during service initialization.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/All Users
- Business Goal: Platform Stability & Revenue Protection  
- Value Impact: Ensures $500K+ ARR dependent on reliable WebSocket connections
- Strategic Impact: Validates Golden Path works during GCP cold start scenarios

Test Strategy:
- E2E tests run in actual GCP staging environment
- Tests reproduce real race conditions with actual Cloud Run timing
- Tests validate complete user journey during startup window
- Tests ensure 1011 errors are prevented through proper coordination

IMPORTANT: These tests require GCP staging environment access and should be run
as part of staging deployment validation pipeline.
