Real Multi-User WebSocket Isolation Security Tests - NO MOCKS



CRITICAL SECURITY TESTS: These tests validate that WebSocket events and user data

do NOT leak between different authenticated users in a multi-tenant environment.



Per CLAUDE.md CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

- ALL e2e tests MUST use authentication (JWT/OAuth)

- Tests MUST fail hard when isolation is violated  

- NO MOCKS - only real WebSocket connections to backend services

- Multi-user isolation is CRITICAL for security



BUSINESS VALUE JUSTIFICATION:

- Segment: Platform/Internal - Multi-user chat security

- Business Goal: Prevent data leaks between users (GDPR compliance)

- Value Impact: Protects user privacy in multi-tenant AI interactions

- Revenue Impact: Prevents security breaches that destroy customer trust



These tests will FAIL IMMEDIATELY if:

- User A receives events/data meant for User B

- Authentication boundaries are crossed

- WebSocket connections leak user data

- Session isolation is compromised
