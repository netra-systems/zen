# E2E Golden Path Test Execution Worklog - 2025-09-13 Afternoon

## Mission Status: GOLDEN PATH VALIDATION AND CONTINUATION

**Date:** 2025-09-13 Afternoon
**Session:** Golden Path E2E Test Validation Follow-up
**Environment:** Staging GCP (netra-backend-staging)
**Objective:** Continue ultimate-test-deploy-loop for Golden Path, validate recent fixes, and ensure system stability

---

## Executive Summary

**Previous Session Status:** CRITICAL WebSocket protocol issue was identified and fixed in PR #650, which addressed WebSocket endpoint returning JSON instead of handling WebSocket upgrades.

**Current Mission:** Validate that the WebSocket fix has been deployed and test the complete Golden Path functionality.

## Phase 1: Current System Status Validation

### Infrastructure Status
- Backend: ✅ HEALTHY (HTTP 200)
- Auth Service: ✅ HEALTHY (HTTP 200) 
- Frontend: ✅ HEALTHY (HTTP 200)
- All services deployed recently (backend: 2025-09-13T01:20:09Z)

### Previous Critical Issue Analysis
From previous session: WebSocket endpoint `/api/v1/websocket` was incorrectly configured as REST endpoint instead of WebSocket protocol handler. Fix implemented in PR #650.

## Phase 2: Test Selection and Execution Planning

Based on staging test index and previous results, focusing on:
1. **Priority 1 Critical Tests** - Core platform functionality ($120K+ MRR at risk)
2. **WebSocket Event Tests** - Validate the protocol fix
3. **Agent Pipeline Tests** - Ensure agent execution works end-to-end
4. **Message Flow Tests** - Confirm real-time messaging
