---

## PHASE 1: E2E TEST SELECTION - "ALL" CATEGORY

### 1.1 Test Focus Analysis
**E2E-TEST-FOCUS:** all (comprehensive test coverage across all categories)
**Modified Strategy:** Service stability validation prioritized before full test execution

### 1.2 Staging E2E Test Index Review
**Total Available Tests:** 466+ test functions (from STAGING_E2E_TEST_INDEX.md)
**Priority Categories for Execution:**

#### Immediate Priority - Service Health Validation Tests
1. **Connectivity Tests** - Basic service availability validation
2. **Health Check Tests** - Endpoint responsiveness verification
3. **Authentication Tests** - JWT and OAuth basic functionality

#### Secondary Priority - Core Functionality Tests (Pending Service Stability)
1. **P1 Critical:** 25 tests (Core platform functionality - $120K+ MRR at risk)
2. **WebSocket Events:** 5 tests (Real-time chat infrastructure)
3. **Agent Pipeline:** 6 tests (AI execution workflows)
4. **Message Flow:** 8 tests (Chat processing pipeline)

#### Deferred - Comprehensive Test Suite (Pending 503 Resolution)
1. **P2-P6 Tests:** 100+ tests across medium to low priority categories
2. **Integration Tests:** Cross-service coordination
3. **Performance Tests:** Load and stress testing
4. **Journey Tests:** End-to-end user workflows

### 1.3 Recent Critical Issues Impact Analysis
**From Previous Worklog Analysis:**
1. **SSOT Infrastructure Collapse:** 0.0% compliance identified (Issue #983)
2. **WebSocket Event Structure:** Fixed but service unavailable for validation
3. **ClickHouse Driver:** Missing CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD resolved but unverifiable

- **Systemic Failure Pattern:** Multiple endpoint types affected simultaneously

### 1.4 Test Execution Strategy - Modified for Crisis Response

**MODIFIED STRATEGY: Service Stability First**
1. **Phase 1:** Service availability assessment and basic connectivity validation
2. **Phase 2:** Minimal critical functionality testing (if services responsive)
3. **Phase 3:** Progressive test expansion based on service stability
4. **Phase 4:** Full "all" category execution only if infrastructure stable

**Expected Business Impact Coverage (Conditional):**
- **Golden Path Chat:** Dependent on WebSocket 503 resolution
- **Authentication:** Basic validation if services responsive
- **Infrastructure:** Health check restoration critical
- **User Experience:** Service availability prerequisite for all testing

---

## PHASE 2: SERVICE CONNECTIVITY ASSESSMENT

### 2.1 Critical Service Availability Validation Required

Based on HTTP 503 cluster analysis, immediate connectivity assessment needed before proceeding with comprehensive E2E test execution.

**High-Priority Connectivity Tests:**
```bash
# Step 1: Basic Health Check Validation
curl -I https://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/health

# Step 2: WebSocket Endpoint Availability
curl -I https://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/ws

# Step 3: Cloud Run Direct Health Check
# (URL to be determined from GCP console)

# Step 4: Load Balancer Health Status
# Verify load balancer health check configuration
```

**Service Response Analysis:**
- **Expected:** HTTP 200 OK with reasonable response times (<2s)
- **Current Issue:** HTTP 503 Service Unavailable with 2-12s latencies
- **Threshold:** Must achieve stable 200 responses before proceeding

### 2.2 Progressive Test Execution Plan

**IF Services Responsive (HTTP 200, <2s response):**
```bash
# Minimal Critical Test Suite
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py

# Basic Staging Connectivity
python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_staging_connectivity_validation.py -v

# WebSocket Events (if connectivity confirmed)
python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_1_websocket_events_staging.py -v

# Authentication Basic Validation
python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_auth_routes.py -v
```

**IF Services Remain Unavailable (HTTP 503):**
- Focus on service infrastructure analysis
- Document service unavailability patterns
- Create critical infrastructure recovery issue
- Defer comprehensive E2E testing until service stability restored

### 2.3 Resource Monitoring During Testing

**Critical Metrics to Track:**
- **Response Times:** Must be <2s for stable testing
- **HTTP Status Codes:** Must be 200 OK consistently
- **Memory Usage:** Monitor for memory leaks during test execution
- **Connection Failures:** Track WebSocket connection establishment rates

**Authenticity Validation Protocol:**
- Verify real execution times (never 0.00s)
- Document actual staging environment connectivity
- Capture genuine error messages and infrastructure responses
- Confirm staging URL patterns and SSL certificate validation
