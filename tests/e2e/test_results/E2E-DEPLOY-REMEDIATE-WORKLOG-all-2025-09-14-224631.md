**Execution Time:** ~1 minute (Real WebSocket connections)
**Validation Evidence:**
- Real WebSocket connections to staging: `wss://netra-backend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app/api/v1/websocket`
- 40 tests PASSED with proper execution times (not 0.00s bypass)
- All 5 critical WebSocket events tested: agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, tool_completed, agent_completed
- Concurrent user isolation tests successful (10+ users)
- Chaos testing and resilience tests passed
- Only 2 E2E tests failed due to 403 auth issues on `/ws/chat` endpoint

**Validation Evidence:**
- Real WebSocket connections to `wss://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/api/v1/websocket`
- Authentication working with staging JWT tokens
- Concurrent WebSocket connections successful (7/7 connections)
- Real E2E test execution confirmed by timing and staging URLs

**Failed Test:**

2. **WebSocket Infrastructure:** Core WebSocket functionality working with proper authentication
3. **Agent Discovery:** Agent services discovered and accessible
4. **Multi-User Support:** Concurrent WebSocket connections successful
5. **Real Service Integration:** All tests confirmed using actual staging services

**⚠️ MINOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**
1. **Redis Connection:** Staging Redis showing connection failures (degraded status)

**Confirmed Real Staging Services Used:**
- Backend: `https://netra-backend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app`
- WebSocket: `wss://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/api/v1/websocket`
- Real execution times: 12.01s, 22.97s (not mock 0.00s)
