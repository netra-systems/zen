## PHASE 1: E2E TEST SELECTION ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### 1.1 Test Focus Analysis
**E2E-TEST-FOCUS:** all (comprehensive coverage prioritizing critical business functions)

### 1.2 Selected Test Strategy

**Test Execution Order (Business Impact Priority):**

1. **P1 Critical Tests** (`test_priority1_critical_REAL.py`)
   - Business Impact: $120K+ MRR at risk
   - Tests 1-25: Core platform functionality
   - Focus: Authentication, WebSocket connection, Basic agent flow

2. **Mission Critical WebSocket Suite** (`test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`)
   - Business Impact: Real-time chat functionality ($500K+ ARR)
   - Focus: Agent events, WebSocket stability, Event delivery

3. **Staging WebSocket Events** (`test_1_websocket_events_staging.py`)
   - Business Impact: Real-time communication infrastructure
   - Tests: 5 core WebSocket event flows

4. **Staging Message Flow** (`test_2_message_flow_staging.py`)
   - Business Impact: Core chat message processing
   - Tests: 8 message processing scenarios

5. **P2 High Priority** (`test_priority2_high.py`)
   - Business Impact: $80K MRR
   - Tests 26-45: Key features

**Rationale:**
- Starting with P1 critical to validate core business functions
- WebSocket tests address multiple open issues (#1226, #1212, #1210)
- Message flow validates end-to-end chat functionality
- Progressive validation from critical to high priority

### 1.3 Known Issues Context
Based on recent GitHub issues and previous worklogs:
- WebSocket factory pattern SSOT violations causing multi-user issues
- Python 3.13 compatibility issues with WebSocket connections
- Context serialization failures in agent pipelines
- Unit test collection failures affecting overall test discovery

---

## PHASE 2: TEST EXECUTION üîÑ IN PROGRESS

### 2.1 Test Execution Plan
Will execute tests using unified test runner with staging environment configuration:
```bash
# Primary command pattern
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --env staging --category e2e --real-services

# Individual test pattern for targeted runs
python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/[test_file] -v --tb=short
```

### 2.2 Test Results

#### P1 Critical Tests ‚úÖ EXECUTED (37.5% Pass Rate)
- **Command:** Multiple test files in P1 critical category
- **Execution Time:** 140.50s total - **REAL STAGING CONFIRMED**
- **Results:** 24 tests, 9 passed, 15 failed
- **‚úÖ Working:** HTTP API layer, health endpoints, user isolation
- **‚ùå Critical Issue:** WebSocket 1011 internal errors blocking real-time functionality
- **Business Impact:** $120K+ MRR at risk due to WebSocket failures

**Breakdown by Test Suite:**
- Critical Path Infrastructure: 6/6 PASSED ‚úÖ (100%)
- Golden Path Complete: 0/2 PASSED ‚ùå (test framework issues)
- WebSocket Business Critical: 0/5 PASSED ‚ùå (auth 401 errors)
- Real Agent Execution: 1/7 PASSED ‚ö†Ô∏è (WebSocket blocking)
- Connectivity Validation: 2/4 PASSED ‚ö†Ô∏è (WebSocket 1011 errors)

#### Mission Critical WebSocket Tests ‚úÖ EXECUTED (45% Pass Rate)
- **Command:** Multiple mission critical WebSocket test suites
- **Execution Time:** ~30s average - **REAL STAGING CONFIRMED**
- **Results:** 20 tests total, 9 passed, 11 failed
- **üö® Critical Findings:**
  - WebSocket 1011 internal errors on ALL staging connections
  - ALL 5 required WebSocket events MISSING (agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, tool_completed, agent_completed)
  - 9 deprecated SSOT imports still present (Issue #1226)
  - Authentication bypass broken (401 errors)
- **Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR Golden Path completely blocked

**Test Suite Results:**
- test_websocket_mission_critical_fixed.py: 4/7 PASSED
- test_staging_websocket_agent_events_enhanced.py: 4/5 PASSED
- test_issue_1100_websocket_ssot_mission_critical.py: 0/4 PASSED (SSOT violations)
- test_websocket_agent_events_staging.py: 1/4 PASSED

## PHASE 3: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS üìù ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### 3.1 Failure Analysis

**PRIMARY ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Missing `websocket_manager_factory.py` module causing cascading import failures

### 3.2 Five Whys Analysis for WebSocket 1011 Errors

**Why 1**: Why are we getting 1011 internal errors?
- WebSocket connections fail during initialization because WebSocket manager cannot be created

**Why 2**: Why is the WebSocket manager failing internally?
- The `websocket_manager_factory.py` module is completely missing from the codebase

**Why 3**: Why is initialization failing?
- Import failures cascade during startup, causing fallback to emergency patterns incompatible with staging

**Why 4**: Why are there SSOT violations?
- Issue #1226 SSOT migration is incomplete - factory was removed but dependent imports weren't updated

**Why 5**: Why weren't these caught in testing?
- Test infrastructure has fallback mechanisms that mask the missing factory locally but fail in staging

### 3.3 Critical Findings

**Missing File**: `/netra_backend/app/websocket_core/websocket_manager_factory.py` - **DOES NOT EXIST**

**Failed Import Locations**:
1. `supervisor_factory.py:394` - Attempts factory import
2. `unified_init.py:27-31` - Imports WebSocketManagerFactory, IsolatedWebSocketManager, create_websocket_manager
3. Multiple test files expecting this module

**SSOT Violations (9 identified)**:
1. manager.py - Deprecated warnings
2. __init__.py - ISSUE #1144 warnings
3. unified_init.py - Missing factory import
4. supervisor_factory.py - Factory import attempt
5. canonical_imports.py - Compatibility stubs
6. migration_adapter.py - References to removed factory
7-9. Multiple test files with deprecated patterns

**Missing WebSocket Events**: All 5 events missing due to manager initialization failure
