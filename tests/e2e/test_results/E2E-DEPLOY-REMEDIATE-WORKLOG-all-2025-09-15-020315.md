**Real Service Interaction Proof:**
- WebSocket connections to actual staging URLs
- JWT authentication against staging database
- Real infrastructure health checks revealing actual degraded state
- Execution times proving genuine service interactions (not mocks)

### 2.6 Root Cause Analysis - Infrastructure vs System

**INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES (External Dependencies):**
- Redis connectivity failure (VPC/networking)
- PostgreSQL performance degradation (database overload/config)
- Environment variable loading issues (deployment config)

**SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY (Core Application):**
- ‚úÖ WebSocket connections work
- ‚úÖ Authentication mechanisms work
- ‚úÖ API endpoints functional
- ‚úÖ Service discovery operational
- ‚ùå **Agent execution pipeline blocked by infrastructure issues**

### 2.7 Business Impact Assessment

**$500K+ ARR Golden Path Status:**
- ‚úÖ **User Login:** Working (auth validated)
- ‚úÖ **WebSocket Connection:** Working (connection tests pass)
- ‚ùå **Agent Responses:** **BLOCKED** by infrastructure timeout issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Overall Golden Path:** **DEGRADED** - users can connect but won't get AI responses

**Core Issue:** Agent execution pipeline requires stable Redis/PostgreSQL infrastructure for state management and response delivery.

### 2.8 Fresh Deployment Impact Assessment

**Fresh deployment (2025-09-15T01:58:37) DID NOT resolve infrastructure issues:**
- Same Redis connection failures persist

## Step 2.5: Five Whys Analysis for Agent Execution Failure

### Issue: Agent Execution Pipeline Timeout (121s) with No WebSocket Events

**WHY 1:** Why do agent executions timeout without sending WebSocket events?
- **Answer:** Agent pipeline cannot complete initialization and execution due to infrastructure dependency failures

**WHY 2:** Why do infrastructure dependencies fail to support agent execution?
- **Answer:** Redis connection failures prevent state management and PostgreSQL degradation slows data access critical for agent operation

**WHY 3:** Why do Redis connections fail and PostgreSQL performance degrade?
- **Answer:** VPC networking issues prevent Redis connectivity (10.166.204.83:6379 timeout) and database resource constraints cause 5+ second response times

**WHY 4:** Why do VPC networking and database resource issues persist after fresh deployment?
- **Answer:** These are infrastructure-level configuration and resource allocation issues that are not resolved by application deployment

**WHY 5:** Why were infrastructure-level issues not resolved in deployment pipeline?
- **Answer:** Infrastructure deployment validation gaps in the pipeline do not verify external dependency health before declaring deployment successful

### Remediation Strategy

**IMMEDIATE (Infrastructure Team):**
1. Fix Redis VPC connectivity to 10.166.204.83:6379
2. Scale PostgreSQL resources to improve response times
3. Add infrastructure health gates to deployment pipeline

**MEDIUM TERM (Platform Team):**
1. Implement graceful degradation for Redis failures
2. Add database connection pooling optimization
3. Create infrastructure health monitoring

**VALIDATION:**
- Re-run agent execution tests after infrastructure fixes
- Expect to see all 5 WebSocket events delivered successfully
- Target agent execution completion under 30 seconds

## Step 3: Recommendations and Next Actions

### 3.1 Immediate Priority Actions

**CRITICAL PATH:** Infrastructure fixes required before system can deliver $500K+ ARR value

1. **Infrastructure Team (P0):**
   - Fix Redis VPC connectivity issue (10.166.204.83:6379)
   - Scale PostgreSQL resources to achieve <1s response times
   - Validate infrastructure health end-to-end

2. **Platform Team (P1):**
   - Add infrastructure health gates to deployment pipeline
   - Implement agent execution monitoring and alerting

### 3.2 System Stability Confirmation
