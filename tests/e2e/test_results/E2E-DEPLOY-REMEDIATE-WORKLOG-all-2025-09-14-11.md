# E2E Deploy Remediate Worklog - All Tests Focus
**Date:** 2025-09-14
**Time:** 11:01 UTC
**Environment:** Staging GCP
**Focus:** All E2E tests with emphasis on Golden Path and WebSocket issues
**Process:** Ultimate Test Deploy Loop

## Executive Summary

**Session Goal:** Run comprehensive E2E tests on staging GCP remote, focusing on "all" test categories, remediate issues found, and create PR if stable.

**Current System Status:**
- Backend deployed: netra-backend-staging-00611-cr5 (2025-09-14 14:26:38 UTC) - RECENT
- Services available: netra-auth-service, netra-backend-staging, netra-frontend-staging
- Known issues from recent logs: WebSocket service readiness issues (Issue #449)

## Step 1: Test Selection and Planning

### Priority Test Categories Selected (Based on E2E Index):

**P1 Critical Tests (MRR at Risk: $120K+):**
- `tests/e2e/staging/test_priority1_critical_REAL.py` (Tests 1-25)
- Core platform functionality validation

**P2 High Priority Tests (MRR at Risk: $80K):**
- `tests/e2e/staging/test_priority2_high.py` (Tests 26-45)
- Key features validation

**Core Staging Tests:**
- `test_1_websocket_events_staging.py` - WebSocket event flow (5 tests) - CRITICAL
- `test_2_message_flow_staging.py` - Message processing (8 tests)
- `test_3_agent_pipeline_staging.py` - Agent execution pipeline (6 tests)

**Known Issues to Address:**
1. Issue #1061: WebSocket Connection State Lifecycle Errors
2. Issue #1060: WebSocket Authentication path fragmentation blocking Golden Path
3. Issue #1059: Agent Golden Path Messages Work E2E Tests - 15% Coverage
4. Issue #1058: WebSocket event broadcasting duplication
5. WebSocket service readiness issues (503 status from previous reports)

### Test Execution Strategy:
1. Start with WebSocket connectivity tests (most critical)
2. Progress through P1 critical tests
3. Focus on Golden Path user flow validation
4. Address SSOT compliance issues found

## Step 2: Test Execution Progress

### Initial System Health Check

**Deployment Status:**
- ✅ Backend service recently deployed (within hours)
- ✅ All three services (auth, backend, frontend) available
- ⚠️ Previous reports indicate WebSocket service issues

**Next Action:** Execute WebSocket connectivity tests first to validate current service status
