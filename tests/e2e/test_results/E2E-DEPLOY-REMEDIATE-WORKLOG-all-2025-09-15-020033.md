## Test Selection Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Validation (Priority 1)
**Goal:** Confirm infrastructure readiness before business logic testing

1. **System Health Check**
   ```bash
   # Basic connectivity validation
   curl https://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/health
   pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_staging_connectivity_validation.py -v
   ```

2. **Infrastructure Dependency Validation**
   ```bash
   # Database connectivity and performance
   pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_staging_configuration_validation.py::test_database_health -v
   ```

### Phase 2: WebSocket Infrastructure Testing (Priority 1)
**Goal:** Validate Issue #1209 resolution and WebSocket stability

1. **WebSocket Connection Validation**
   ```bash
   # Validate WebSocket bridge fixes
   pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_1_websocket_events_staging.py::test_websocket_connection_establishment -v
   ```

2. **WebSocket Event Delivery**
   ```bash
   # Confirm all 5 critical events working
   pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_1_websocket_events_staging.py -v
   ```

### Phase 3: Agent Execution Pipeline Testing (Priority 2)
**Goal:** Validate agent execution after infrastructure fixes

1. **Agent Discovery and Registry**
   ```bash
   # Test agent registry functionality
   pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_3_agent_pipeline_staging.py::test_agent_discovery -v
   ```

2. **End-to-End Agent Execution**
   ```bash
   # Golden Path agent execution
   pytest tests/e2e/test_real_agent_execution_staging.py::test_001_unified_data_agent_real_execution -v
   ```

### Phase 4: Golden Path Business Logic Testing (Priority 2)
**Goal:** Validate complete user journey after infrastructure resolution

1. **Complete User Journey**
   ```bash
   # End-to-end user flow
   pytest tests/e2e/journeys/test_cold_start_first_time_user_journey.py -v
   ```

2. **Business Value Protection**
   ```bash
   # P1 Critical business functions
   pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_priority1_critical_REAL.py -v
   ```

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Validation (Priority 3)
**Goal:** Full system validation after core issues resolved

1. **Multi-User and Performance**
