## Test Focus Selection - Based on Golden Path Priority

### E2E Test Selection Strategy

Based on STAGING_E2E_TEST_INDEX.md and recent Git issues (#1197-1199), focusing on:

1. **Priority 1 Critical Tests** ($120K+ MRR at risk)
   - File: `tests/e2e/staging/test_priority1_critical_REAL.py`
   - Tests: 1-25 covering core platform functionality

2. **Golden Path End-to-End Flow** (Issues #1197)
   - File: `tests/e2e/journeys/test_cold_start_first_time_user_journey.py`
   - Focus: Login → AI Responses complete flow

3. **WebSocket Event Delivery** (Issue #1199)
   - File: `tests/e2e/staging/test_1_websocket_events_staging.py`
   - Tests: All 5 critical WebSocket events (agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, tool_completed, agent_completed)

4. **Multi-User Isolation Validation** (Issue #1198)
   - File: `tests/e2e/test_real_agent_context_management.py`
   - Focus: Concurrent user testing and state isolation

### Open GitHub Issues to Address
- **Issue #1199:** WebSocket Event Delivery Validation - All 5 Events Reliable
- **Issue #1198:** Multi-User Isolation Validation - Concurrent User Testing  
- **Issue #1197:** End-to-End Golden Path Testing - Login → AI Responses Flow

---

## Test Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: System Health Validation
1. Verify backend health endpoint responds (200 OK)
2. Confirm WebSocket connectivity
3. Validate auth service integration

### Phase 2: Priority 1 Critical Tests
1. Run `tests/e2e/staging/test_priority1_critical_REAL.py`
2. Validate real execution times (not 0.00s bypassing)
3. Confirm $120K+ MRR functionality operational

### Phase 3: Golden Path Flow Validation
1. Run end-to-end user journey tests
2. Validate Login → AI Responses complete flow
3. Confirm WebSocket event delivery for all 5 events

### Phase 4: Multi-User Isolation Testing
1. Run concurrent user scenarios
2. Validate state isolation between users
3. Confirm no data contamination

---

## Success Criteria

**System Health Requirements:**
- Backend health endpoint returns 200 OK consistently
- WebSocket connections establish successfully
- Auth service responds to validation requests
- No critical errors in GCP logs

**Test Execution Requirements:**
- All tests show real execution times (not 0.00s)
- P1 tests achieve >95% pass rate
- Golden Path user flow completes successfully
- WebSocket events deliver reliably
- Multi-user isolation maintains state separation

**Business Value Protection:**
- $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality operational
- Real-time chat (90% platform value) working
- User workflows complete end-to-end
- No regression in core platform capabilities
