"""
End-to-end tests for WebSocket immediate disconnect regression prevention.

These tests verify the complete WebSocket connection lifecycle works correctly,
preventing the "Loading chat..." issue where connections immediately disconnect
with ABNORMAL_CLOSURE (1006).

To verify these tests catch the regression:
1. Break either the state checking or subprotocol negotiation
2. These tests should fail with connection closing immediately
3. Restore both fixes
4. Tests should pass with stable connections
