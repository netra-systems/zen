E2E Staging Tests: User Chat Agent Execution Workflows

=====================================================



This module tests complete user chat to agent execution workflows in staging environment.

Tests REAL user interactions, agent orchestration, tool execution, and business value delivery.



Business Value:

- Validates core chat-to-AI functionality delivers $50K+ MRR value

- Ensures agent execution pipeline works end-to-end with real LLMs

- Tests complete user journey from chat input to valuable AI response

- Validates multi-agent collaboration and tool execution



CRITICAL E2E REQUIREMENTS:

- MUST use real authentication (JWT/OAuth)

- MUST use real LLM agents and tool execution

- MUST test complete business workflows that deliver value

- MUST validate WebSocket real-time communication

- NO MOCKS ALLOWED - uses real services, agents, and LLMs



Test Coverage:

1. Complete chat message to agent response workflow

2. Multi-agent collaboration with tool execution

3. Long-running agent tasks with progress updates

4. Agent failure recovery and error handling

5. Complex business workflows with multiple agent interactions
