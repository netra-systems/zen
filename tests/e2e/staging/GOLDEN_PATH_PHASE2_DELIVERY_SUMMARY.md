## Test Scenarios Implemented

### Core Test Coverage

#### 1. Complete Golden Path User Flow ⭐
- **Purpose**: End-to-end validation of login → message → AI response
- **Critical Path**: WebSocket auth → message routing → agent execution → response delivery
- **Business Value**: Validates core $500K+ ARR user journey
- **Performance**: Connection ≤10s, first event ≤20s, completion ≤120s

#### 2. WebSocket Event Sequence Validation
- **Purpose**: Ensure correct event ordering after proxy removal
- **Critical Events**: `agent_started` → `agent_thinking` → `tool_executing` → `tool_completed` → `agent_completed`
- **Validation**: Sequential order and timing consistency

#### 3. Concurrent User Isolation
- **Purpose**: Verify user isolation maintained during routing changes
- **Test Method**: 3 concurrent users with unique markers
- **Critical Check**: No cross-user data contamination

#### 4. Error Handling and Graceful Degradation
- **Purpose**: Validate system resilience during routing issues
- **Test Scenarios**: Malformed messages, incomplete requests, system recovery
- **Critical Requirement**: No system crashes, graceful error handling

#### 5. Performance Baseline Establishment
- **Purpose**: Establish metrics for pre/post migration comparison
- **Measurements**: Connection time, first event latency, completion time
- **Critical Use**: Detect performance regression after proxy removal

## Technical Implementation Highlights

- ✅ Business value indicator extraction (cost, efficiency, ROI keywords)
- ✅ Actionable insight validation in AI responses
- ✅ User experience quality maintenance measurement
- ✅ Revenue impact protection through comprehensive testing

### Performance Monitoring
- ✅ Comprehensive metrics collection via `GoldenPathTestMetrics`
- ✅ Real-time event timing and sequence tracking
- ✅ Performance threshold validation and alerting
- ✅ Baseline establishment for migration comparison
- ✅ Business impact measurement and reporting

## Usage Examples

### Quick Validation (30-60 seconds)
```bash
python tests/e2e/staging/run_golden_path_phase2_test.py --quick
```

### Full Test Suite (5-10 minutes)
```bash
python tests/e2e/staging/run_golden_path_phase2_test.py --full
```

### Performance Baseline (2-3 minutes)
```bash
python tests/e2e/staging/run_golden_path_phase2_test.py --baseline
```

### Via Unified Test Runner
```bash
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category e2e --pattern golden_path_phase2
```

## Protection Strategy

### Before Phase 2 Migration
1. **Establish Baseline**: Run full test suite to validate current state
2. **Record Metrics**: Capture performance and quality baselines
3. **Validate Environment**: Ensure staging environment operational
4. **Confirm Success**: All tests must pass before proceeding

### During Phase 2 Migration
1. **Pre-Migration Check**: Quick validation before deployment
2. **Deploy Changes**: Execute MessageRouter proxy removal
3. **Immediate Validation**: Quick test to confirm basic functionality
4. **Full Validation**: Complete test suite to validate no regression

### After Phase 2 Migration
1. **Performance Comparison**: Compare against pre-migration baseline
2. **Extended Validation**: Run comprehensive test coverage
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Enable ongoing Golden Path monitoring
4. **Success Confirmation**: Document successful migration completion

## Risk Mitigation

### Failure Detection
- ❌ **Any test failure**: Immediate migration halt required
- ❌ **Performance degradation**: Investigation and remediation needed
- ❌ **Response quality drop**: AI system validation required
- ❌ **User isolation violation**: Security remediation critical

### Rollback Triggers
