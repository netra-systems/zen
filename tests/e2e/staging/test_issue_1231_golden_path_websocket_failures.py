Issue #1231 Golden Path WebSocket Failures - E2E Staging Tests

CRITICAL BUG: async/await bug in websocket_ssot.py breaks the Golden Path user flow

These E2E tests demonstrate how the async/await bug impacts the complete user experience
on the staging environment, breaking the core business functionality.

Business Impact:
- Complete Golden Path user flow broken
- Users cannot login and get AI responses
- 90% of platform value non-functional
- $500K+ ARR dependency completely broken
- Real-time chat experience destroyed

Test Focus:
- Complete user authentication -> chat flow
- WebSocket event delivery during user interactions
- Staging environment WebSocket endpoints
- Real-time messaging and AI response delivery
- Multi-user concurrent scenarios

Expected Results: ALL TESTS SHOULD FAIL until the bug is fixed

NOTE: These tests require staging GCP environment access
Run with: pytest --staging flag
