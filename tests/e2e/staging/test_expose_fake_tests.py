"""
CRITICAL MISSION: Comprehensive FAILING Test Suite to Expose Fake Staging Tests

This test suite is designed to PROVE that staging tests are fake by creating tests
that FAIL when run against fake implementations but PASS when run against real staging.

Each test is designed to be IMPOSSIBLE to pass without making actual network calls.
These tests will expose the truth about fake staging test implementations.

LIFE OR DEATH CRITICAL - These tests must expose the fake tests!
