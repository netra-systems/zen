Test Staging Infrastructure Reproduction for Issue #1278

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform
- Business Goal: Reproduce exact Issue #1278 in staging environment
- Value Impact: Validates $500K+ ARR Golden Path pipeline offline due to infrastructure
- Strategic Impact: Provides concrete evidence for infrastructure team remediation priority
