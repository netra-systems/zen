"""
Test circuit breaker error recovery patterns in the system.

This E2E test validates that the system can gracefully handle service failures
and recover from circuit breaker states across multiple service boundaries.

Business Value: Platform/Infrastructure - Service Resilience
Prevents cascading failures and ensures system stability during outages.
