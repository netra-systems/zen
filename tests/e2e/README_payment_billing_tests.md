# Payment Billing Accuracy Test Suite

## Overview

CRITICAL TEST IMPLEMENTATION #2: Payment Processing and Billing Accuracy

**Business Value Justification (BVJ):**
- **Segment:** All paid tiers (protects $80K+ MRR from billing errors)
- **Business Goal:** Prevent billing disputes and revenue leakage from payment processing errors
- **Value Impact:** Ensures accurate payment processing, usage tracking, invoicing, and billing record creation
- **Revenue Impact:** Each billing error can cost $1K+ in customer trust and support time

## Test Files

### 1. `payment_billing_helpers.py`
