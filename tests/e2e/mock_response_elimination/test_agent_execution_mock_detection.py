Agent Execution Mock Response Detection Tests

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise) - $500K+ ARR at risk
- Business Goal: Ensure 100% authentic AI responses for agent execution
- Value Impact: Prevent customer churn from receiving inauthentic AI responses
- Strategic Impact: Core platform credibility depends on authentic agent interactions

CRITICAL: These tests are designed to FAIL initially to prove that mock responses
can reach users through the ModelCascade and EnhancedExecutionAgent fallback paths.

Test Status: FAILING (Expected) - Proves mock responses reach users
Fix Required: Replace fallback responses with authentic error handling
