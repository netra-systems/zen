# Critical Integration Test Implementation Plan
## Auth-WebSocket-Agent Unified System Testing

### Executive Summary
This plan addresses the most critical missing integration tests for the Netra Apex platform, focusing on the interplay between Authentication service, WebSocket communication, and Agent orchestration. These tests are essential for ensuring the unified system works correctly in production.

### Top 10 Critical Missing Tests

#### 1. Auth-WebSocket Handshake Integration Test
**Priority: P0 - CRITICAL**
**File:** `test_auth_websocket_handshake_integration.py`
**Scope:** 
- JWT token validation during WebSocket connection establishment
- Token refresh handling during active connections
- Cross-service token validation flow (Auth → Backend → WebSocket)
**Key Validations:**
- Token is validated with Auth service before WebSocket accepts connection
- Expired tokens are rejected with proper error events
- Refreshed tokens maintain connection continuity

#### 2. Agent Lifecycle WebSocket Events Test
**Priority: P0 - CRITICAL**
**File:** `test_agent_lifecycle_websocket_events.py`
**Scope:**
- Testing all missing WebSocket events: agent_thinking, partial_result, tool_executing, final_report
- Event payload field validation and consistency
- UI layer update timing (Fast/Medium/Slow)
**Key Validations:**
- All expected events are emitted with correct payloads
- Events arrive in correct order and timing windows
- Frontend receives and processes all event types

#### 3. Cross-Service Auth Synchronization Test
**Priority: P0 - CRITICAL**
**File:** `test_cross_service_auth_sync.py`
**Scope:**
- Token validation across all microservices
- Session persistence between Auth/Backend/Frontend
- OAuth flow completion with WebSocket notification
**Key Validations:**
- Token issued by Auth service works in Backend
- Session state is consistent across services
- OAuth completion triggers WebSocket event

#### 4. WebSocket Reconnection with Auth State Test
**Priority: P1 - HIGH**
**File:** `test_websocket_reconnection_auth.py`
**Scope:**
- Reconnection after token expiry
- State restoration post-reconnection
- Message queue preservation during disconnection
**Key Validations:**
- Reconnection uses refreshed token automatically
- Agent state is restored after reconnection
- No messages lost during disconnection

#### 5. Multi-Agent WebSocket Isolation Test
**Priority: P1 - HIGH**
**File:** `test_multi_agent_websocket_isolation.py`
**Scope:**
- Concurrent agent execution with event routing
- User-specific message isolation
- Thread-specific agent coordination
**Key Validations:**
- User A doesn't receive User B's agent events
- Multiple agents can run concurrently per user
- Thread context is maintained correctly

#### 6. Agent Failure Recovery via WebSocket Test
**Priority: P1 - HIGH**
**File:** `test_agent_failure_websocket_recovery.py`
**Scope:**
- Error event propagation through WebSocket
- Graceful degradation notifications
- Circuit breaker activation events
**Key Validations:**
- Agent failures trigger error events
- Frontend receives actionable error information
- System recovers gracefully from agent failures

#### 7. WebSocket Message Format Validation Test
**Priority: P0 - CRITICAL**
**File:** `test_websocket_message_format_validation.py`
**Scope:**
- Frontend/backend field consistency (content field)
- Type/payload vs event/data structure alignment
- Coroutine error handling
**Key Validations:**
- Frontend "content" field maps correctly to backend
- Message structure is consistent {type, payload}
- Async/await patterns work correctly

#### 8. Auth Service Independence Validation Test
**Priority: P0 - CRITICAL**
**File:** `test_auth_service_independence.py`
**Scope:**
- No imports from main app
- Standalone deployment capability
- API-only communication verification
**Key Validations:**
- Auth service starts without main app
- All communication via HTTP/gRPC APIs
- No shared database access

#### 9. Thread Management WebSocket Flow Test
**Priority: P1 - HIGH**
**File:** `test_thread_management_websocket.py`
**Scope:**
- Thread creation/switching events
- Context preservation across threads
- Historical message loading
**Key Validations:**
- New thread creation triggers WebSocket event
- Switching threads loads correct history
- Agent context maintained per thread

#### 10. Real-time Streaming with Auth Validation Test
**Priority: P1 - HIGH**
**File:** `test_streaming_auth_validation.py`
**Scope:**
- Streaming partial results with auth checks
- Token validation during long-running streams
- Rate limiting enforcement
**Key Validations:**
- Auth checked periodically during streaming
- Expired tokens stop stream gracefully
- Rate limits enforced during streaming

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Tests 1, 7, 8)
- Set up test harness for cross-service testing
- Create mock Auth service for isolated testing
- Implement WebSocket test client with full event capture

#### Phase 2: Core Integration (Tests 2, 3, 4)
- Implement agent lifecycle event testing
- Add cross-service auth validation
- Build reconnection test framework

#### Phase 3: Advanced Scenarios (Tests 5, 6, 9, 10)
- Multi-user isolation testing
- Failure recovery scenarios
- Thread management validation
- Streaming with auth checks

### Test Data Requirements

#### Seeded Test Data
- 10 test users with various auth states
- 5 OAuth provider configurations
- 20 pre-configured agent prompts
- 100 historical messages across 10 threads

#### Mock Configurations
- Mock LLM responses for deterministic testing
- Simulated network failures
- Token expiry scenarios
- Rate limit triggers

### Success Metrics
- 100% of critical paths have integration tests
- All WebSocket events validated end-to-end
- Auth flow works across all services
- Zero silent failures in WebSocket communication
- All tests run in < 5 minutes for integration level

### Common Test Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Cross-Service Test Setup
```python
async def setup_unified_test():
    auth_service = await start_auth_service()
    backend = await start_backend_with_auth(auth_service.url)
    ws_client = await connect_websocket_with_auth(backend.url)
    return auth_service, backend, ws_client
```

#### Pattern 2: WebSocket Event Validation
```python
async def validate_event_flow(ws_client, expected_events):
    received = []
    async for message in ws_client.messages():
        received.append(message)
        if len(received) == len(expected_events):
            break
    assert_events_match(received, expected_events)
```

#### Pattern 3: Auth State Verification
```python
def verify_auth_consistency(auth_token, services):
    for service in services:
        response = service.validate_token(auth_token)
        assert response.valid == True
        assert response.user_id == expected_user_id
```

### Risk Mitigation
- **Risk:** Tests too slow
  - **Mitigation:** Use test containers, parallel execution
- **Risk:** Flaky WebSocket tests
  - **Mitigation:** Implement retry logic, generous timeouts
- **Risk:** Auth service coupling
  - **Mitigation:** Strict API boundaries, no shared imports

### Next Steps
1. Create test file stubs for all 10 tests
2. Implement shared test utilities
3. Build tests incrementally with continuous validation
4. Run tests in CI/CD pipeline
5. Monitor test execution time and optimize
