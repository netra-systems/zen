E2E Test for Landing Page Authentication Redirect Issues

This test reproduces the critical authentication redirect failures identified in the Five Whys analysis,
specifically the landing page failing to properly redirect unauthenticated users and auth state 
detection issues causing infinite loops or slow redirects.

Root Cause Being Tested:
- Landing page useAuth() hook returns stale/incorrect auth state
- Redirect logic not handling edge cases (loading states, rapid auth changes)
- Auth service mock integration issues in test environment
- Performance issues with auth state detection (>200ms redirects)
