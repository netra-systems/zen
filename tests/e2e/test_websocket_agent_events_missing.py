""""""
Test WebSocket Agent Events Missing (E2E with Authentication)

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
    - Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)  
- Business Goal: Ensure users receive all 5 critical WebSocket events during agent execution
- Value Impact: WebSocket events provide real-time progress and transparency in AI interactions
- Strategic Impact: Core chat experience that drives $""500K"" plus ARR and user trust

CRITICAL: This E2E test reproduces the missing WebSocket events issue identified
in the Five Whys Root Cause Analysis. All e2e tests MUST use authentication per CLAUDE.md.

Expected Events (ALL REQUIRED for business value):
    1. agent_started - User must see agent began processing
2. agent_thinking - Real-time reasoning visibility  
3. tool_executing - Tool usage transparency
4. tool_completed - Tool results display
5. agent_completed - User must know when response is ready

This test SHOULD FAIL initially because the integration gap prevents events from reaching users.
