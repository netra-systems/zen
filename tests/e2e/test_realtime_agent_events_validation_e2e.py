E2E Test: Real-time Agent Events Validation - MISSION CRITICAL Event Quality Assurance



BUSINESS IMPACT: Tests real-time agent event quality and business value delivery.

This validates that agent events provide meaningful, actionable information to users in real-time.



Business Value Justification (BVJ):

- Segment: Platform/All Users - Real-time Event Quality  

- Business Goal: User Experience - Meaningful real-time updates drive engagement

- Value Impact: Validates event content quality that differentiates from generic progress bars

- Strategic Impact: Tests event intelligence that justifies premium AI platform positioning



CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS:

 PASS:  Agent events contain substantive business-relevant content

 PASS:  Events provide meaningful progress updates and context

 PASS:  Real-time event delivery maintains user engagement

 PASS:  Event content demonstrates AI thinking and problem-solving

 PASS:  Events build user confidence in AI capabilities



EVENT QUALITY VALIDATION:

[U+2022] agent_started - Clear explanation of what AI will do

[U+2022] agent_thinking - Visible reasoning and problem analysis

[U+2022] tool_executing - Specific tool usage with expected outcomes

[U+2022] tool_completed - Concrete results and insights delivered

[U+2022] agent_completed - Comprehensive summary with actionable value



COMPLIANCE:

@compliance CLAUDE.md - WebSocket events enable substantive chat (Section 6)

@compliance CLAUDE.md - E2E AUTH MANDATORY (Section 7.3)

@compliance CLAUDE.md - Real-time business value delivery

@compliance SPEC/core.xml - Agent event content standards
