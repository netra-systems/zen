GCP Staging Backend Authentication Failures Test Suite

These tests replicate the CRITICAL authentication issues identified in the GCP staging logs:

IDENTIFIED ISSUES FROM STAGING LOGS:
1. **CRITICAL: Backend Authentication System Complete Failure**
   - Frontend cannot authenticate with backend API
   - All attempts result in 403 Forbidden errors
   - 6.2+ second latency on failed authentication attempts
   - Both retry attempts (1 and 2) fail identically

2. **CRITICAL: Service-to-Service Authentication Broken**  
   - Backend rejects all service-to-service authentication
   - JWT token validation completely non-functional
   - Authentication service may be unreachable

EXPECTED TO FAIL: These tests demonstrate current authentication system breakdown
These are failing tests that replicate actual staging issues to aid in debugging.

Root Causes to Investigate:
- JWT signing keys mismatch between services
- Authentication service unavailable or misconfigured
- Network policies blocking authentication traffic
- Service account permissions missing
- Token refresh mechanism failing
- Frontend-to-backend service discovery issues
