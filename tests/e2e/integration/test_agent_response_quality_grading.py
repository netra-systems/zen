"""Test Agent Response Quality Grading

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)  
- Business Goal: Ensure agents deliver enterprise-grade, actionable responses that drive business outcomes
- Value Impact: Users receive substantive AI solutions that provide measurable business value
- Strategic Impact: Core platform value delivery - high-quality responses drive retention and revenue growth

This comprehensive E2E test validates that the REAL system generates responses
that meet enterprise-grade quality standards across multiple critical dimensions:
- Business Value: Actionable insights with measurable impact and ROI
- Technical Accuracy: Correct, complete, and technically sound responses
- User Experience: Clear, relevant, and immediately useful communications

Quality evaluation uses AI-powered assessment (not naive keyword matching) to ensure
authentic business value delivery. Enterprise threshold is 0.8 (production-ready quality).

CRITICAL: Uses REAL services, REAL agents, REAL LLM responses - ZERO MOCKS
Follows TEST_CREATION_GUIDE.md standards and CLAUDE.md directives.
