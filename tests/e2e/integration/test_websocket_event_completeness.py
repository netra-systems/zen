"""WebSocket Event Flow Completeness Test

P0 CRITICAL - UX BROKEN
BVJ: All customer tiers | UX Fix | Frontend UI layers don't update | Users see blank screens
SPEC: websocket_communication.xml

This test verifies ALL required WebSocket events are sent with correct payloads and that
frontend receives events in correct order within the 10-second requirement.
