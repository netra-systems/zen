FAILING TESTS for Service Startup Coordination Failures - Iteration 2

This test suite addresses service startup coordination issues identified
in iteration 2, focusing on the timing and coordination problems between
services during the startup sequence.

Key Issues Addressed:
- Service startup sequence coordination
- Dependency resolution timing
- Readiness check coordination
- Service discovery integration failures

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: System Reliability, Development Velocity
- Value Impact: Eliminates startup failures, enables predictable development environment
- Strategic Impact: Reduces time-to-productivity for developers, prevents lost work sessions
