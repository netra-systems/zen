Standalone E2E Health Check Tests - Iteration 6-10 Fix
NO IMPORTS from internal modules - completely standalone

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
1. Segment: All customer segments (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise, Platform)
2. Business Goal: System availability and reliability validation
3. Value Impact: Critical infrastructure health monitoring for production readiness
4. Revenue Impact: Prevents downtime that could result in customer churn and revenue loss

This test is designed to be completely standalone and work without any internal imports.
