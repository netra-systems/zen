"""
E2E Docker Example Test - The RIGHT way to write Docker E2E tests
================================================================

This example demonstrates how to write reliable E2E tests with Docker:
1. Uses proper fixtures from conftest.py
2. Demonstrates service interaction patterns
3. Shows proper async/await usage
4. Includes error handling
5. Tests real business functionality

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Development Velocity - reliable tests enable confident deployments
- Value Impact: Provides reference implementation for all E2E tests
- Strategic Impact: Reduces test flakiness and development friction
