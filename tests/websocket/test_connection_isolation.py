"""

WebSocket Connection Isolation Test Suite.



This test suite validates that the new connection-scoped WebSocket implementation

completely eliminates cross-user event leakage. Each test verifies isolation

boundaries and ensures events only reach intended recipients.



Business Value: Prevents $500K+ ARR loss from user trust issues due to event leakage.



CRITICAL: All tests use real WebSocket connections per CLAUDE.md requirements.

NO MOCKS are used - this ensures we test the actual isolation behavior.
