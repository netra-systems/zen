INTEGRATION TEST: Docker Manager Golden Path Integration

BUSINESS VALUE JUSTIFICATION (BVJ):
1. Segment: Platform/Infrastructure - Golden Path Validation
2. Business Goal: Ensure Docker services support critical user workflows
3. Value Impact: Validates Docker infrastructure supports $500K+ ARR chat functionality
4. Revenue Impact: Protects Golden Path reliability for customer success

PURPOSE:
This test suite validates that Docker Manager properly supports the Golden Path
user flow by ensuring real Docker services are available and functional for
the core business workflows.

GOLDEN PATH INTEGRATION:
1. User authentication (requires backend services)
2. WebSocket connection (requires real-time infrastructure)
3. Agent execution (requires containerized AI services)
4. Chat functionality (requires end-to-end service orchestration)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Uses REAL Docker services, never mocks
- Validates actual service connectivity
- Ensures Golden Path workflows can execute
- Tests production-like service configurations
