Agent Pipeline Integration Tests - Issue #861 Coverage Improvement

This package contains comprehensive integration tests for the agent pipeline system,
targeting coverage improvement from 9.12% to 65%+ across four priority areas:

Priority 1: WebSocket Event Delivery (0/5 → 5/5 events)
Priority 2: Agent Execution Pipeline (0% → 70%)  
Priority 3: Tool Dispatcher Integration (8% → 70%)
Priority 4: State Persistence Integration (12% → 75%)

These tests protect $500K+ ARR golden path functionality and ensure reliable
