Integration Test: Thread Service Missing Detection



MISSION CRITICAL: This test prevents the thread service missing condition that causes

fallback handler creation instead of proper thread management.



PURPOSE: Reproduce and prevent the WebSocket.py line 549 condition where thread_service is None,

ensuring the system waits for real thread service or fails hard, never creating fallback handlers.



Business Value Justification (BVJ):

- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)

- Business Goal: Prevent thread service race conditions from degrading chat functionality

- Value Impact: Ensure proper thread management for multi-turn conversations

- Strategic Impact: Protect conversation continuity and user experience



CRITICAL: This test must FAIL if fallback handlers are created due to missing thread service.
