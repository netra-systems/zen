Agent WebSocket Coordination Integration Tests

This test suite contains 25 high-quality integration tests that validate agent execution
with WebSocket context integration patterns. These tests fill the critical gap between
unit tests and E2E tests by testing real business logic without requiring external services.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Validate agent-WebSocket coordination for real-time user feedback
- Value Impact: Ensures the 90% business value of chat - real-time agent progress visibility
- Strategic Impact: Foundation for multi-tenant agent execution with complete user isolation

Test Categories:

1. Agent-WebSocket Factory Integration (5 tests)
   - Factory creates agents with proper WebSocket bridge integration
   - Event routing through factory-created components
   - Agent isolation maintained through factory
   - Error handling in factory WebSocket integration
   - State synchronization with factory-created agents

2. UserExecutionEngine WebSocket Integration (5 tests) 
   - User execution engine WebSocket emitter integration
   - Tool dispatcher WebSocket event emission
   - Concurrent user WebSocket event isolation
   - WebSocket error resilience in user execution
   - WebSocket event ordering in user execution

3. Agent Event Delivery Validation (5 tests)
   - All 5 critical WebSocket events delivered (MISSION CRITICAL)
   - Event delivery with multiple tool executions
   - Event delivery failure recovery patterns
   - Event delivery timing validation
   - Event delivery content validation

4. Multi-User Agent Isolation (5 tests)
   - Complete isolation between concurrent users (MISSION CRITICAL)
   - User agent state isolation
   - Concurrent tool execution isolation
   - User execution statistics isolation
   - User WebSocket emitter isolation

5. Agent Execution Context WebSocket Bridge (5 tests)
   - Execution context WebSocket bridge coordination
   - State transitions synchronized with WebSocket events
   - Error handling with WebSocket bridge coordination
   - Metadata propagation to WebSocket events
   - Concurrent execution context bridge coordination

Key Features Tested:
- All 5 critical WebSocket events: agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, tool_completed, agent_completed
- Complete user isolation for multi-tenant operations
- Factory pattern integration with WebSocket events
- Error resilience and graceful degradation
- Real-time event delivery timing and ordering
- Metadata propagation for rich user experience
- Concurrent execution without cross-contamination

Usage:
Run all tests: python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category integration --pattern="agent_websocket_coordination"
Run specific test file: python tests/unified_test_runner.py --test-file tests/integration/agent_websocket_coordination/test_agent_factory_websocket_bridge_integration.py

Requirements:
- No external services required (integration level)
- Uses SSOT test framework patterns
- Mock factories and WebSocket emitters for isolation
- Comprehensive BVJ documentation for business value
- Mission critical tests marked appropriately
