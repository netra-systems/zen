"""
Test ExecutionEngine Factory Delegation

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
- Business Goal: Ensure ExecutionEngine properly delegates to factory pattern
- Value Impact: Factory delegation enables per-user isolation and WebSocket event delivery
- Strategic Impact: Core architecture pattern for multi-user system security and functionality

CRITICAL: This test reproduces the ExecutionEngine factory delegation failure identified
in the Five Whys Root Cause Analysis. ExecutionEngine was not updated when the factory
pattern was implemented, breaking the handoff to UserExecutionEngine.

Based on Five Whys Analysis:
- Root Cause: ExecutionEngine factory delegation to UserExecutionEngine is broken
- Impact: Per-request WebSocket emitter creation fails
- Evidence: Factory initialization failures cause cascade errors

This test SHOULD FAIL initially because ExecutionEngine doesn't use the new factory pattern.
