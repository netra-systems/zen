"""
Integration Tests for Configuration Validation Bridge - Issue #683

These tests are DESIGNED TO FAIL initially to demonstrate the missing 
automated secret injection bridge between SecretConfig, deployment scripts,
and actual GCP Secret Manager integration.

Business Impact: $500K+ ARR staging deployments depend on automated validation
that ensures secrets exist and are properly injected during deployment.

Test Coverage:
1. Integration between SecretConfig and deployment scripts
2. GSM secret availability validation  
3. Deployment command generation with real secret validation
4. Cross-service secret consistency validation
5. Staging environment specific validation

Expected Failures:
- GSM client not available in test environment
- No bridge between SecretConfig and actual deployment validation
- Missing integration between secrets_config.py and deploy_to_gcp_actual.py
- No automated validation in deployment pipeline

SSOT Compliance: Uses SSotBaseTestCase for consistent test infrastructure.
Real Services: Tests integration points without mocks where possible.
