"""Empty docstring."""
Integration tests to reproduce WebSocket authentication timeout issues (Issue #395).

REPRODUCTION TARGET: WebSocket handshake failures due to 0.5s auth service timeout.
These tests SHOULD FAIL initially to demonstrate the WebSocket-auth integration timeout problem.

Key Integration Issues to Reproduce:
1. WebSocket handshake blocked by auth service connectivity checks
2. 179-second WebSocket latencies caused by auth service timeout waits  
3. Chat functionality blocked by authentication failures
4. Golden Path user flow disrupted by auth timeouts
