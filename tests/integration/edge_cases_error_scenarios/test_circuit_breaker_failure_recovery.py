"""

Integration Tests: Circuit Breaker Failure Recovery



Business Value Justification (BVJ):

- Segment: Enterprise (high-availability requirements)

- Business Goal: System Resilience + Uptime Maximization + Service Continuity

- Value Impact: Prevents cascade failures from bringing down entire system,

  ensures graceful degradation during service outages, maintains partial

  functionality when dependencies fail, enables rapid recovery when services

  return to health

- Revenue Impact: Protects $500K+ ARR from system-wide outages, reduces

  downtime costs ($10K+ per hour), enables Enterprise SLA commitments

  (99.9% uptime), prevents customer churn from service interruptions



Test Focus: Circuit breaker pattern implementation, failure detection,

automatic recovery, graceful degradation, and service health monitoring.
