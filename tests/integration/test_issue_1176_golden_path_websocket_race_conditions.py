Golden Path Integration Test Suite 2: WebSocket Race Condition Reproduction (Issue #1176)

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
- Business Goal: Ensure WebSocket handshake works reliably for Golden Path
- Value Impact: WebSocket race conditions in Cloud Run prevent real-time chat
- Strategic Impact: Core platform functionality ($500K+ ARR at risk)

This suite reproduces integration-level WebSocket race conditions that occur
specifically in Cloud Run deployments, despite WebSocket components working
individually in local testing.

Root Cause Focus: Component-level excellence but integration-level coordination gaps
