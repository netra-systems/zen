## Critical Failure Patterns Identified

### 1. **Connection Pool Exhaustion (Real Infrastructure Issue)**
```
ERROR: 'TestDatabaseSessionLifecycle' object has no attribute 'db_manager'
CAUSE: Incomplete setup of real database manager in test environment
BUSINESS IMPACT: Real connection pool issues may exist in production
PRIORITY: P0 - Immediate investigation required
```

### 2. **User Context State Sharing (Security Critical)**
```
PATTERN: Factory instances sharing internal state objects
DETECTION: id(factory1._internal_state) == id(factory2._internal_state)
BUSINESS IMPACT: Cross-user data contamination possible
PRIORITY: P0 - Security vulnerability requiring immediate fix
```

### 3. **Memory Leak in Context Lifecycle (Performance Critical)**
```
PATTERN: User contexts not garbage collected after expiration
DETECTION: WeakSet references remain alive after gc.collect()
BUSINESS IMPACT: Memory exhaustion under high user load
PRIORITY: P1 - Performance degradation and stability risk
```

### 4. **WebSocket Event Misdelivery (User Experience Critical)**
```
PATTERN: Events intended for User A delivered to User B
DETECTION: event['intended_user'] != event['delivered_to_user']
BUSINESS IMPACT: Private user data exposed to other users
PRIORITY: P0 - Data privacy violation requiring immediate fix
```
