"""
Service Communication Failure Integration Test - CLAUDE.md Compliant

Tests real service communication failure scenarios without mocks.
Validates circuit breaker patterns, retry logic, and graceful degradation.

Business Value: Platform/Internal - System Resilience & Service Independence
Ensures microservice architecture handles failures gracefully to maintain user experience.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use REAL services (no mocks)
- Test actual service failures via docker-compose service manipulation
- Validate circuit breakers, retry logic, graceful degradation
- Use IsolatedEnvironment for all environment access
- Follow SSOT principles and absolute imports
