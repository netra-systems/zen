Integration Tests for Issue #270 - Service Orchestration Gap Detection

This test suite is designed to expose the service orchestration gap that would
prevent the AsyncHealthChecker from working in a real service environment.
These tests are EXPECTED TO FAIL, demonstrating the integration issues.

Test Categories:
1. Service Discovery Tests: Real service connection attempts (should FAIL)
2. Docker Integration Tests: Container orchestration (should FAIL - no Docker)
3. Network Connectivity Tests: Inter-service communication (should FAIL)
4. Full Stack Integration: End-to-end health checking (should FAIL)

Expected Outcomes:
- Most tests should FAIL due to missing services/Docker
- This demonstrates the orchestration gap that needs addressing
- PASS: Tests that work without Docker dependencies
- FAIL: Tests that expose real integration issues
