"""Concurrent WebSocket Connections Race Condition Test

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: ALL (Free ‚Üí Enterprise) - Multi-User System Support
- Business Goal: $500K+ ARR protection through reliable concurrent connections
- Value Impact: Prevent connection state corruption and user data leakage
- Revenue Impact: Ensures system can handle multiple users simultaneously

Test Strategy: This test MUST FAIL before SSOT consolidation and PASS after
- FAIL: Currently race conditions from multiple managers cause connection issues
- PASS: After SSOT consolidation, proper connection isolation and state management

Issue #1033: WebSocket Manager SSOT Consolidation  
This test validates that WebSocket connections can handle multiple concurrent users
without race conditions, state corruption, or cross-user data contamination.
