Integration Tests for Issue #1263 - Infrastructure Connectivity Failures

CRITICAL OBJECTIVE: Integration tests that FAIL to reproduce the complete infrastructure
connectivity failure chain that causes 25.0s database timeouts in staging.

ROOT CAUSE INTEGRATION ANALYSIS:
- VPC connector capacity scaling delays during peak load
- Cloud SQL connection pool pressure under concurrent requests
- Startup sequence database initialization timeouts
- Service-to-service connectivity degradation during infrastructure stress

INTEGRATION TEST STRATEGY: Test complete service integration paths that demonstrate
the infrastructure connectivity issues. These should FAIL initially to prove the
infrastructure problem exists across service boundaries.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Infrastructure
- Business Goal: System Reliability & Service Integration
- Value Impact: Validates end-to-end service connectivity under infrastructure stress
- Strategic Impact: Ensures $500K+ ARR platform stability during scaling events
