"""
Service Health Monitoring with Dependency Awareness - Issue #1192

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform (All Segments)
- Business Goal: Operational Excellence & Service Reliability
- Value Impact: Accurate health reporting enables proper load balancing and alerting
- Strategic Impact: Foundation for SLA/SLO monitoring and automated incident response

This test suite validates enhanced service health monitoring that understands
service dependencies and provides accurate health aggregation during failures.

Tests are designed to INITIALLY FAIL to expose current health monitoring gaps:
- Health endpoints that fail completely on any dependency failure
- No distinction between critical and non-critical service dependencies
- Missing circuit breaker state integration with health reporting
- Lack of service dependency health aggregation logic
- No performance-based health degradation reporting
