WebSocket Integration Tests - Real Authentication & Services

Business Value:
- Validates WebSocket connection and messaging functionality
- Ensures proper JWT authentication flow works end-to-end
- Tests heartbeat and core WebSocket protocol compliance
- Prevents WebSocket regressions that would break chat functionality

Architecture Compliance:
- Uses REAL authentication via E2EAuthHelper (no mocks)
- Tests against actual WebSocket endpoints (/ws)
- Follows User Context Architecture for proper isolation
- Validates all critical WebSocket events are working

CRITICAL: Per CLAUDE.md requirements:
- ALL integration tests MUST use real authentication
- NO mocks in integration tests - use real services
- Use test_framework/ssot/e2e_auth_helper.py for SSOT auth patterns
