Bug Reproducer Tests: Message Router Integration Test Failures



Business Value Justification:

- Segment: Platform/Internal

- Business Goal: Test Reliability & System Stability  

- Value Impact: Reproduce specific test failure patterns to validate fixes

- Strategic Impact: Ensure test suite accurately reflects production behavior



These tests reproduce the exact bugs identified in the integration test failures

and validate that fixes address root causes, not just symptoms.



Created following CLAUDE.md Section 3.5 MANDATORY BUG FIXING PROCESS.
