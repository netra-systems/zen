"""
Enhanced Graceful Degradation Integration Tests - Issue #1192

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform (All Segments)
- Business Goal: Revenue Protection & User Experience
- Value Impact: Maintains $500K+ ARR chat functionality during service outages
- Strategic Impact: Ensures users always receive meaningful responses and guidance

This test suite enhances existing graceful degradation patterns with advanced
scenarios beyond the current `test_graceful_degradation_service_dependencies.py`.

Tests are designed to INITIALLY FAIL to expose gaps in current degradation handling:
- Advanced fallback response quality
- User experience during prolonged service outages
- Progressive degradation based on service availability
- Recovery transition user experience
- Performance during degraded states
