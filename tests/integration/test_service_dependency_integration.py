"""
Service Dependency Integration Tests - Issue #1192

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform (All Segments)
- Business Goal: Revenue Protection & Service Reliability
- Value Impact: Ensures $500K+ ARR chat functionality never completely fails
- Strategic Impact: Validates business continuity during service outages

This test suite validates service dependency integration with graceful degradation patterns.
Tests are designed to INITIALLY FAIL to expose current service dependency issues.

IMPORTANT: These tests should fail initially and guide implementation of:
- Circuit breaker patterns for service dependencies
- Graceful degradation when non-critical services are unavailable
- Service recovery detection and automatic reconnection
- Golden Path preservation during partial service outages

Critical Requirements:
- Golden Path continues when Redis is unavailable
- Golden Path continues when monitoring service is down
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
- Service recovery detection and automatic reconnection
- All 5 WebSocket events sent even with service degradation
