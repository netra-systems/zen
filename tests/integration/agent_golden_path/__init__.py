Agent Golden Path Integration Tests Package

This package contains comprehensive integration tests for the agent golden path
message processing pipeline, covering:

1. Message Pipeline Integration - Complete user message â†’ AI response flow
2. WebSocket Event Sequence Integration - Real-time event delivery and timing
3. Multi-User Message Isolation Integration - User isolation and security
4. Agent Response Quality Integration - Response quality and business value

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: All tiers - Core platform functionality validation
- Business Goal: Ensure reliable agent-based AI assistance delivery
- Value Impact: Protects 500K+ USD ARR golden path functionality
- Revenue Impact: Prevents complete failure of core business value proposition

TEST MODULES:
1. test_complete_message_pipeline_integration.py - Full message processing pipeline
2. test_websocket_event_sequence_validation.py - WebSocket event delivery validation
3. test_agent_state_persistence_integration.py - Multi-turn conversation state management
4. test_business_value_validation_integration.py - Business value content validation
5. test_multi_user_concurrent_processing.py - Multi-user scalability and isolation
6. test_error_recovery_integration.py - Error handling and system resilience

CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- NO DOCKER usage - all tests run against GCP staging environment
- Real WebSocket connections and agent execution
- Business value focus - tests validate meaningful AI assistance delivery
- SSOT test patterns following existing codebase conventions
- Comprehensive error handling and timeout management
- Multi-user isolation and security validation

EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Tests require staging environment authentication credentials
- Each test is designed to fail properly (no 0.x execution bypassing)
- All tests follow SSOT BaseTestCase patterns
- Tests validate both technical success AND business value delivery
