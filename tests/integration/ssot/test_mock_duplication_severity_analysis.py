Issue #1065: Mock Duplication Severity Analysis Test Suite

Analyzes severity of mock duplication violations and provides remediation priority.
Based on baseline measurement of 23,483 total violations.

Business Value: Platform/Internal - System Stability & Development Velocity
Validates SSOT compliance to eliminate test infrastructure duplication.

Test Strategy:
1. Analyze mock duplication patterns by severity
2. Identify high-impact files requiring immediate attention
3. Prioritize remediation based on business impact
4. Generate actionable remediation roadmap

Expected Baseline: 23,483 violations (21,524 generic + 1,088 websocket + 584 database + 287 agent)
Target State: Systematic reduction with priority-based approach
