Phase 1: Bug Reproduction Tests for Issue #862 - Service-Independent Test Infrastructure

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal - Test Infrastructure  
- Business Goal: Identify and reproduce exact AttributeError bugs preventing 175+ integration tests
- Value Impact: Enable comprehensive bug analysis for service-independent test infrastructure
- Strategic Impact: Protect $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality validation

This module reproduces the exact bugs reported in Issue #862:
1. AttributeError: 'TestAgentExecutionHybrid' object has no attribute 'execution_mode'
2. Test class initialization failures during pytest collection
3. Missing instance variables in base class hierarchy
4. Async setup race conditions preventing proper initialization

CRITICAL: These tests MUST FAIL before fixes and PASS after fixes to validate solution.
