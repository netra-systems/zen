Test WebSocket Business Value Protection - Revenue Protection

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
    - Segment: Platform Revenue Protection (all customer segments)
- Business Goal: Revenue protection + business continuity
- Value Impact: Validates core platform value delivery (90% chat functionality)
- Revenue Impact: Directly protects $""500K"" plus ARR through functional validation

Expected Result: PASSING (business value validated)
Difficulty: CRITICAL - Must validate revenue-protecting functionality

This test suite provides critical protection for business value by validating
WebSocket functionality that directly contributes to revenue generation and
customer satisfaction. All tests in this suite are mission-critical and
must pass for deployment approval.
