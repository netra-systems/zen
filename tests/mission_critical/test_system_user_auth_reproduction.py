System User Authentication Failure Reproduction Test Suite

CRITICAL: These tests MUST FAIL initially to reproduce the exact authentication
failure identified in GitHub Issue #115: System User Authentication Failure.

Purpose: Demonstrate the exact 403 'Not authenticated' error for 'system' user
that is blocking golden path user flows in GCP staging environment.

Business Value: Platform/Internal - Critical system stability issue
- Complete failure of golden path user flows  
- Users cannot authenticate or perform any authenticated operations
"""
"""
- System appears completely broken from user perspective

Root Cause: Missing X-Service-ID and X-Service-Secret headers for internal operations
caused by security hardening that removed auth bypasses without implementing 
proper service-to-service authentication.

IMPORTANT: These tests follow CLAUDE.md requirements:
- Use real services and real authentication flows
- Must show measurable execution time (not 0.00s)  
- No mocks in integration/E2E testing
- Extend SSotBaseTestCase for SSOT compliance

Expected Results BEFORE FIX:
- test_reproduce_current_system_user_403_error() MUST FAIL with 403 'Not authenticated'
- test_dependencies_system_user_without_service_auth() MUST FAIL showing missing headers
- All tests must show meaningful timing and actual error reproduction
