MISSION CRITICAL: SSOT Test Execution Compliance Validation

CRITICAL MISSION: Detect and prevent fragmented test execution patterns that bypass
the unified test runner and violate SSOT testing infrastructure.

BUSINESS VALUE: Protects $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality by ensuring all tests
follow SSOT patterns and preventing test infrastructure fragmentation.

TARGET VIOLATIONS:
1. test_plans/rollback/test_emergency_rollback_validation.py (bypassing unified_test_runner.py)
2. test_plans/phase5/test_golden_path_protection_validation.py (bypassing unified_test_runner.py)
3. test_plans/phase3/test_critical_configuration_drift_detection.py (bypassing unified_test_runner.py)

SSOT REQUIREMENTS ENFORCED:
- ALL test execution must go through tests/unified_test_runner.py
- ALL tests must inherit from SSOT BaseTestCase
- NO direct pytest execution allowed in production test files
- NO fragmented test execution patterns outside unified infrastructure

PURPOSE: These tests MUST FAIL initially to detect current SSOT violations,
then pass after remediation to protect ongoing SSOT compliance.
