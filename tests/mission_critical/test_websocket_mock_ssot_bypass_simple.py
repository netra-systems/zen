SSOT Violation Proof Test: WebSocket Mock Infrastructure Bypassing SSOT (Simplified)

This test PROVES that the test mock infrastructure completely bypasses the established
SSOT WebSocket management patterns, creating a disconnect between test and production.

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Segment: Platform/Internal - Test Infrastructure Integrity
- Business Goal: Stability - Ensure test fidelity matches production behavior  
- Value Impact: Prevents false test confidence and production surprises
- Revenue Impact: Reduces production bugs by improving test accuracy

SSOT VIOLATION ANALYSIS:
1. SSOT Pattern: All WebSocket operations should go through UnifiedWebSocketManager
2. Current State: Test mocks bypass SSOT with custom MockWebSocketManager
3. Expected Behavior: Tests should use SSOT managers with mock protocols/connections
4. Compliance Gap: Test infrastructure ignores production SSOT patterns

This test should FAIL currently and PASS after SSOT consolidation.
