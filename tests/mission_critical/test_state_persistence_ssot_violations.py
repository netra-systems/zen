"Mission Critical: State Persistence SSOT Violation Reproduction Tests"

This test suite reproduces the EXACT import failures that are breaking the golden path
and violating SSOT compliance for state persistence.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Enterprise/Mid ($25K+ MRR workloads) 
- Business Goal: Platform Reliability, Golden Path Stability
- Value Impact: Prevents SSOT violations from breaking customer chat functionality
- Strategic Impact: Ensures single source of truth for state persistence operations

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: These tests MUST FAIL until SSOT remediation is complete.
They reproduce the exact import failures blocking golden path functionality.

Import Failures Being Reproduced:
1. scripts/demo_optimized_persistence.py:22 - Missing optimized persistence module
2. test_3tier_persistence_integration.py:38 - Import breaking 925-line integration test
3. Documentation references to non-existent optimized_state_persistence module

Test Philosophy:
- Tests designed to FAIL and expose current SSOT violation
- Will pass only after proper SSOT consolidation
- No mocks - reproduce actual import failures
- Focus on preventing golden path breakage
