SSOT REMEDIATION VALIDATION TESTS

=================================

Validates that Phase 1 emergency stabilization successfully addresses SSOT violation

while maintaining business continuity for Golden Path validation.



BUSINESS IMPACT:

- $500K+ ARR protection through continued Golden Path testing

- SSOT compliance improvement from 0.4% to measurable progress

- Zero business disruption during remediation



TEST SCOPE:

- Import compatibility validation

- Deprecation warning verification  

- Business continuity assurance

- SSOT violation containment
