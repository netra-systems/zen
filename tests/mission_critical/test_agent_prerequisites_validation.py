"Mission Critical Test: Agent Execution Prerequisites Validation"

PURPOSE: Validates that all prerequisites for agent execution are checked BEFORE execution starts.

This test demonstrates the current gap where agent execution can start without validating:
- WebSocket connection is ready
- Required services are available (database, redis, etc.)
- Agent registry is properly initialized
- User context is properly established
- Resource limits are not exceeded
- Required dependencies are available

These tests should FAIL initially, proving the need for comprehensive prerequisite validation.

Business Value: $500K+ ARR protection by preventing failed executions and ensuring reliable user experience.
