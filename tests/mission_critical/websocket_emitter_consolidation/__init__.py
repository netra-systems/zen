WebSocket Emitter Consolidation Test Suite

This module contains mission-critical tests for validating WebSocket event emitter consolidation
to resolve Issue #200: Multiple WebSocket event emitters causing race conditions.

Business Impact: Protects $500K+ ARR from event delivery failures and race conditions.

Test Phases:
1. Phase 1 (Pre-Consolidation): Tests that MUST FAIL to prove current issues exist
2. Phase 2 (Consolidation): Tests that validate SSOT consolidation works correctly  
3. Phase 3 (Post-Consolidation): Tests that verify elimination of race conditions

Test Structure:
- test_multiple_emitter_race_condition_reproduction.py (Phase 1 - Expected to FAIL)
- test_event_source_validation_fails_with_duplicates.py (Phase 1 - Expected to FAIL)
- test_unified_emitter_ssot_compliance.py (Phase 2 - Should PASS after consolidation)
- test_emitter_consolidation_preserves_golden_path.py (Phase 2 - Should PASS after consolidation)
- test_no_race_conditions_single_emitter.py (Phase 3 - Should PASS after consolidation)
- test_single_emitter_performance_validation.py (Phase 3 - Should PASS after consolidation)

Usage:
# Run all consolidation tests
pytest tests/mission_critical/websocket_emitter_consolidation/

# Run specific phase
pytest -m "phase_1_pre_consolidation"
pytest -m "phase_2_consolidation" 
pytest -m "phase_3_post_consolidation"

# Run tests expected to fail (pre-consolidation)
pytest -m "expected_to_fail"
