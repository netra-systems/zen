Mission Critical Tests for Issue #1101 MessageRouter Business Protection

These tests protect critical business functionality during SSOT consolidation:
    1. Protect $500K+ plus ARR Golden Path user flow
2. Validate critical WebSocket events are preserved
3. Ensure agent execution continues working
4. Prevent revenue-impacting regressions

Business Value Justification:
    - Segment: Platform/Production - Mission Critical
- Business Goal: Revenue Protection and System Stability
"""

- Value Impact: Protects $500K+ plus ARR from MessageRouter failures
- Strategic Impact: Ensures business continuity during SSOT transition
