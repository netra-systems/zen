Mission Critical Tests: WebSocket Events with All Authentication Modes

PURPOSE: Validate all 5 critical WebSocket events are delivered with different 
authentication validation levels to ensure golden path completion.

BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION:
- Critical Events: 90% of platform business value delivered via WebSocket events
- Revenue Protection: $500K+ ARR depends on reliable event delivery
- User Experience: Events provide transparency and trust in AI interactions
- Auth Permissiveness: Events must work with all auth modes (strict/relaxed/demo/emergency)

CRITICAL WEBSOCKET EVENTS (REQUIRED FOR GOLDEN PATH):
1. agent_started - User sees agent began processing
2. agent_thinking - Real-time reasoning updates  
3. tool_executing - Tool usage transparency
4. tool_completed - Tool results display
5. agent_completed - Final response ready

MISSION CRITICAL TEST STRATEGY:
- Test each event with all auth modes
- Validate event delivery timing and content
- Ensure events work even with degraded auth
- Verify events persist through auth failures
- Validate event ordering and completeness

EXPECTED FAILURES:
These tests MUST FAIL INITIALLY to prove events are broken:
1. Events fail due to WebSocket 1011 errors from auth blocking
2. Permissive auth modes not implemented, so events can't be tested
3. Event delivery timing issues with auth failures
4. Missing events when auth is degraded
