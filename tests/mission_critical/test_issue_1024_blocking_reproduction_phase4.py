Phase 4: Mission Critical Tests for Issue #1024 - Blocking Issue Reproduction

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform (All segments affected by deployment blocks)
"""
"""
- Business Goal: Stability - Prevent deployment blocking from test chaos
- Value Impact: Protects $500K+ ARR from deployment delays and failures
- Revenue Impact: Prevents customer churn from unreliable system deployments

CRITICAL PURPOSE: Reproduce the actual deployment-blocking issues caused by
unauthorized test runners and quantify business impact.

Test Strategy:
1. Reproduce deployment-blocking test failures
2. Demonstrate business impact quantification
3. Validate mission-critical test reliability gaps
4. Create failing tests that prove the problem exists
