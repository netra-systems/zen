 ALERT:  MISSION CRITICAL: WebSocket JWT Bypass Violation Reproduction Test

SSOT VIOLATION REPRODUCTION - Test #1 of 5
This test EXPOSES the violation where WebSocket accepts invalid tokens due to verify_signature=False.

VIOLATION DETAILS:
- File: netra_backend/app/websocket_core/user_context_extractor.py
- Lines: 193-196 (JWT decode with verify_signature=False)
- Issue: WebSocket accepts ANY JWT token without signature validation

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- BEFORE SSOT FIX: Test PASSES (proving violation exists - invalid tokens accepted)  
- AFTER SSOT FIX: Test FAILS (proving violation fixed - invalid tokens rejected)

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Enterprise/Security-conscious customers
- Business Goal: Security compliance and customer trust
- Value Impact: Prevents unauthorized access to $500K+ ARR chat functionality
- Revenue Impact: Security breach could cost entire customer base

AUTH SSOT REQUIREMENT:
All JWT operations MUST go through UnifiedAuthInterface - NO local JWT validation.
