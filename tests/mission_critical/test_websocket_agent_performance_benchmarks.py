Performance Benchmark Tests for WebSocket Agent Events - Issue #1059 Phase 2

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Enterprise/Platform 
- Business Goal: Validate performance benchmarks for Golden Path completion
- Value Impact: Ensures agents meet enterprise SLA requirements for response time
- Revenue Impact: Protects enterprise accounts ($100K+ ARR) requiring guaranteed performance

Performance Targets:
- Golden Path completion: <120s (2 minutes)
- First WebSocket event: <5s 
- WebSocket event latency: <100ms
- Concurrent user support: ≥3 users
- Token efficiency: ≥10 tokens/second
- Memory efficiency: <50MB per user session

Critical Path: Performance Monitoring → SLA Compliance → Enterprise Retention
