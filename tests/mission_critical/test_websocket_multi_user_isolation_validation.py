MISSION CRITICAL: Multi-User WebSocket Isolation Validation Tests - Issue #1199

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: Enterprise Security & Platform Scalability  
- Business Goal: Ensure complete user isolation for enterprise deployments
- Value Impact: Validates security boundaries critical for HIPAA/SOC2 compliance
- Strategic Impact: Prevents data leakage that could result in enterprise contract loss

CRITICAL TEST SCOPE:
This test file focuses on multi-user isolation validation scenarios:
1. User context isolation - events only reach intended users
2. Concurrent user validation - multiple users don't interfere'
3. Cross-user contamination detection - prevents data leakage
4. WebSocket connection isolation - separate connections per user

DESIGN TO FAIL INITIALLY:
These tests are designed to fail if user isolation is compromised,
ensuring enterprise-grade security for multi-tenant deployments.
