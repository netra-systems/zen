Mission Critical Test: Triage Agent Start Failure Reproduction

"""
"""
This test reproduces the EXACT failure that prevents triage agents from starting,
which directly impacts the Golden Path user flow and $500K+ ARR chat functionality.

BUSINESS CRITICAL ISSUE:
- Users cannot get AI responses because triage agent fails to start
- Failure occurs at agent_handler.py line 125: 'async for' with _AsyncGeneratorContextManager
- This blocks the entire chat experience delivery pipeline

PURPOSE: Validate the exact conditions that cause triage start failure and
ensure the fix (async for  ->  async with) resolves the issue completely.

FAILURE REPRODUCTION:
1. WebSocket connection established 
2. User sends chat message
3. AgentHandler.start_agent() called for triage
4. get_request_scoped_db_session() returns _AsyncGeneratorContextManager
5. 'async for db_session in ...' fails with TypeError
6. Agent never starts, user gets no response

Business Value: Free/Early/Mid/Enterprise - Chat Functionality (90% of platform value)
Ensures triage agents can start successfully to deliver AI-powered responses.

MISSION CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Must reproduce exact production failure conditions
- Must fail with current broken code
- Must pass after async for  ->  async with fix  
- Uses real services where possible
- Validates complete triage agent start flow
