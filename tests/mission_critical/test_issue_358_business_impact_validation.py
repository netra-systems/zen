Mission Critical Tests for Issue #358: Business Impact Validation

""""

CRITICAL ISSUE: Complete system lockout preventing users from accessing AI responses
BUSINESS IMPACT: $"500K" plus ARR at risk due to complete Golden Path failure

These tests are MISSION CRITICAL and DESIGNED TO FAIL to prove that business-critical
functionality is completely broken, validating the revenue and customer impact of
Issue #358 through concrete business metrics.

Test Categories:
    1. Revenue-generating user flow validation (complete blockage)
2. Customer experience degradation validation (complete failure)
3. Business continuity assessment (complete breakdown)
4. Competitive impact validation (platform non-functional)

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
    - Segment: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise, Platform)
- Business Goal: Revenue Protection & Business Continuity
- Value Impact: Validate $"500K" plus ARR functionality and customer experience
- Strategic Impact: Prove business-critical systems are operational

REQUIREMENTS per CLAUDE.md:
    - NEVER skip these tests (@pytest.mark.no_skip)
- MUST FAIL initially to prove business impact exists
- Focus on revenue and customer experience metrics
- Use real business scenarios and user workflows
- Document business impact through concrete failures

MISSION CRITICAL DESIGNATION:
    These tests protect core business functionality. Failure of these tests indicates
complete business emergency requiring immediate escalation and resolution.
