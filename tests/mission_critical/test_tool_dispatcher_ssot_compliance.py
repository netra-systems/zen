Mission Critical Test Suite: Tool Dispatcher SSOT Compliance

Business Value: Platform/Internal - System Reliability & SSOT Compliance
Critical for $500K+ ARR protection through tool dispatcher SSOT compliance.

This test suite validates:
1. Single tool dispatcher implementation pattern (UnifiedToolDispatcher)
"""
"""
2. No direct imports bypassing UniversalRegistry
3. Factory pattern usage for user isolation
4. WebSocket event delivery through proper channels
5. Tool execution through canonical SSOT patterns

The tests FAIL with current violations and PASS after SSOT fixes.
