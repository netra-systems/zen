WebSocket Timeout Optimization Validation Tests

CRITICAL: Validates the secondary timeout fixes that resolve 60s/120s WebSocket latency patterns.
After fixing the primary 179s auth timeout, this test ensures all remaining timeout sources
are optimized for <5s WebSocket responsiveness.

Business Value: $30K+ MRR chat functionality requires <5s response times for user experience.
