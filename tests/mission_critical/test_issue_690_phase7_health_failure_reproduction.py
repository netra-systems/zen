Issue #690 - Staging Backend Health Validation Failure Reproduction Test
=========================================================================

CRITICAL: This test reproduces the exact 1 critical services unhealthy" failure"
identified in Issue #690 staging deployment logs.

BVJ (Business Value Justification):
    - Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: System Reliability
- Value Impact: Prevents chat functionality outages in staging
- Strategic Impact: Protects $""500K"" plus ARR by ensuring reliable staging deployments

EXPECTED TO FAIL: These tests demonstrate the exact Phase 7 health validation
issues observed in staging deployment logs, specifically:

1. Phase 7 health validation returns 1 critical services unhealthy
2. LLM manager health check issues in staging environment
3. External dependency blocking health checks
