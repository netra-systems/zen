"""Mission Critical Test: ServiceLocator Singleton User Session Bleeding

REPRODUCTION TEST - This test should FAIL initially due to singleton pattern violations.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: ALL (Free â†’ Enterprise) - $500K+ ARR at risk
- Business Goal: User Isolation & Security
- Value Impact: Prevents catastrophic data leakage between users
- Revenue Impact: Data breach from shared state could cost millions in compliance/reputation

SINGLETON VIOLATION UNDER TEST:
File: netra_backend/app/services/service_locator_core.py:29-38
Issue: ServiceLocator uses singleton pattern (_instance = None) causing state sharing
Impact: Multiple users get the SAME ServiceLocator instance with contaminated state

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- PRE-REFACTORING: This test should FAIL - proving singleton violation exists
- POST-REFACTORING: This test should PASS - proving factory pattern provides isolation

CRITICAL BUSINESS IMPACT:
If ServiceLocator shares state between users, sensitive user data, configurations,
and service instances become accessible across user sessions - a critical security breach.

# Business Impact Documentation
"""
BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS:

1. DATA BREACH RISK:
   - ServiceLocator singleton shares ALL registered services between users
   - User A's sensitive data becomes accessible to User B
   - Violates GDPR, HIPAA, and other data protection regulations

2. REVENUE IMPACT:
   - $500K+ ARR at immediate risk from data leakage
   - Potential millions in compliance penalties and legal costs
   - Complete loss of customer trust and platform reputation

3. TECHNICAL DEBT:
   - Singleton pattern prevents horizontal scaling
   - Creates memory leaks as state accumulates across all users
   - Makes testing impossible due to shared global state

4. SECURITY IMPLICATIONS:
   - Cross-user data access enables privilege escalation
   - Sensitive configuration and credentials shared between users
   - Audit trails become meaningless due to contaminated state

REMEDIATION REQUIRED:
- Replace singleton pattern with factory pattern using UserExecutionContext
- Ensure each user gets isolated ServiceLocator instance
- Implement proper cleanup and memory management
- Add comprehensive integration tests for multi-user scenarios

POST-REFACTORING VALIDATION:
This test should PASS after factory pattern implementation, proving:
- Each user gets separate ServiceLocator instance
- No state bleeding between concurrent users
- Proper memory cleanup and isolation
- Secure multi-user operations
