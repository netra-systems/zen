"""
JWT SSOT Duplication Detection Tests

PURPOSE: These tests FAIL when backend code duplicates JWT operations that should 
only exist in the auth service (SSOT violation). Tests will PASS after SSOT refactor.

MISSION CRITICAL: Protects $500K+ ARR Golden Path by ensuring JWT operations 
are centralized in auth service only.

BUSINESS VALUE: Enterprise/Platform - Security & Compliance
- Prevents JWT validation inconsistencies
- Reduces attack surface 
- Ensures audit trail centralization
- Maintains SSOT architectural compliance

EXPECTED STATUS: FAIL (before SSOT refactor) â†’ PASS (after SSOT refactor)

These tests detect SSOT violations by scanning for:
1. Direct JWT library imports in backend production code
2. JWT decode/verify operations outside auth service
3. JWT secret management duplication
4. WebSocket auth bypassing auth service
