"""
SSOT Tests for UnifiedLifecycleManager  ->  SystemLifecycle Migration

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal - Risk Reduction, Development Velocity  
- Business Goal: Ensure business-focused naming compliance reduces developer confusion
- Value Impact: Clear naming improves maintenance velocity and reduces onboarding time
- Strategic Impact: SSOT compliance prevents architecture violations and technical debt

Test Focus: SSOT compliance, naming conventions, architectural integrity
Test Strategy: 20% NEW tests to validate naming convention migration integrity

REQUIREMENTS:
- NO DOCKER dependency - integration tests only
- Real services where appropriate - follow NO MOCKS policy  
- Test backward compatibility during migration
- Validate business-focused naming principles
- Ensure factory pattern user isolation maintained
