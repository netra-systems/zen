WebSocket SSOT Connection Lifecycle Violation Tests

Tests for SSOT violations in WebSocket connection lifecycle management,
ensuring proper connection creation, management, and cleanup through unified system.

Business Value: Platform/Internal - Prevent connection leaks and race conditions
Critical for system stability and resource management in production.

Test Status: DESIGNED TO FAIL with current code (detecting violations)
Expected Result: PASS after SSOT consolidation unifies connection lifecycle
