"""
Critical test suite for WebSocket routing conflicts during startup.

This test suite exposes the critical issue where multiple WebSocket endpoints
(/ws from main websocket router and /api/mcp/ws from MCP router) create
routing conflicts and cause startup validation failures.

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- The MCP router at /api/mcp/ws expects JSON-RPC format messages
- The main WebSocket router at /ws expects regular JSON messages
- The dev_launcher WebSocket validator sends regular JSON to /ws
- If MCP router is loaded, it may intercept or conflict with /ws validation
- This causes the "WebSocket connection test failed" error during startup

Business Value Justification:
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: System Stability & Development Velocity
- Value Impact: Prevents 100% of WebSocket-related startup failures
- Strategic Impact: Eliminates developer productivity loss from connection issues
