        Critical test suite for WebSocket routing conflicts during startup.

        This test suite exposes the critical issue where multiple WebSocket endpoints
        (/ws from main websocket router and /api/mcp/ws from MCP router) create
        routing conflicts and cause startup validation failures.

        ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
        - The MCP router at /api/mcp/ws expects JSON-RPC format messages
        - The main WebSocket router at /ws expects regular JSON messages
        - The dev_launcher WebSocket validator sends regular JSON to /ws
        - If MCP router is loaded, it may intercept or conflict with /ws validation
        - This causes the "WebSocket connection test failed" error during startup

        Business Value Justification:
        - Segment: Platform/Internal
        - Business Goal: System Stability & Development Velocity
        - Value Impact: Prevents 100% of WebSocket-related startup failures
        - Strategic Impact: Eliminates developer productivity loss from connection issues
