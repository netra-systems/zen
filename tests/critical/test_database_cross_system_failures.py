"""
Database Cross-System Consistency Failure Tests (Tests 66-70)

These tests are designed to FAIL initially to expose real database consistency issues
between PostgreSQL, Redis cache, and ClickHouse analytics systems. Each test represents
a specific failure mode that could occur in production.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: System Stability & Risk Reduction  
- Value Impact: Prevents data inconsistency that could cause billing errors and user data corruption
- Strategic Impact: Enables proactive detection of cross-database consistency failures

IMPORTANT: These tests WILL FAIL initially. This is intentional to expose actual issues.
