MASTER TEST SUITE: Comprehensive WebSocket Notification Failure Detection

CRITICAL BUSINESS REQUIREMENT:
    This is the MASTER test suite that runs all WebSocket notification failure tests.
    Every test in this suite is designed to FAIL initially to expose critical issues
    that could cause complete loss of real-time user feedback.

    BUSINESS IMPACT:
        - Chat functionality delivers 90% of product value
        - WebSocket failures = user abandonment = revenue loss
        - Each failure mode represents a potential $"50K"+ ARR impact

        TEST CATEGORIES:
            1. Bridge Initialization Failures (15 tests)
            2. Cross-User Security Violations (12 tests)
            3. Performance & Load Failures (8 tests)
            4. Reconnection & Recovery Failures (10 tests)
            5. Notification Delivery Failures (20 tests)

            TOTAL: 65+ comprehensive failure tests

            EXECUTION STRATEGY:
                - Run in isolated environment to avoid side effects
                - Each test captures detailed failure metrics
                - Generate comprehensive failure report
                - All tests SHOULD FAIL initially - that's the point!'
