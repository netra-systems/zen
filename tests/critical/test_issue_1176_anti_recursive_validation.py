Anti-Recursive Test for Issue #1176: Test Infrastructure Crisis Prevention

This test specifically detects and prevents the recursive pattern where:
1. Test infrastructure claims success without running tests
2. False positive reporting leads to infrastructure claims
3. Documentation documents unverified capabilities
4. The process creates a recursive loop of false validation

CRITICAL: This test must FAIL when the infrastructure is broken.
