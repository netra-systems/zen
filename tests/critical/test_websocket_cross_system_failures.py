"""
WebSocket Cross-System Failure Tests (Tests 26-35)

These tests are designed to FAIL initially to expose real WebSocket communication issues
between backend and frontend systems. Each test represents a specific failure mode that
could occur in production.

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: System Stability & Risk Reduction  
- Value Impact: Prevents WebSocket failures that could cause 100% communication loss
- Strategic Impact: Enables proactive detection of cross-system communication failures

IMPORTANT: These tests WILL FAIL initially. This is intentional to expose actual issues.
