CRITICAL: WebSocket Bridge Initialization Edge Cases Test Suite

BUSINESS CRITICAL: WebSocket bridge initialization is the foundation of real-time chat.
If bridge initialization fails or has race conditions, users get NO feedback during AI execution.

These tests are designed to FAIL initially to expose critical initialization issues:
1. Bridge becomes None during agent execution
2. Multiple threads compete for bridge initialization  
3. Bridge initialization times out under load
4. Bridge state becomes corrupted during concurrent access
5. Silent failures when bridge dependencies are missing

Business Impact: Complete loss of real-time feedback = user abandonment
