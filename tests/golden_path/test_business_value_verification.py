Business Value Verification Test - Issue #1278 Phase 4

This test validates that chat functionality delivers the expected 90% of platform value.
It goes beyond technical functionality to verify that users receive substantive,
actionable AI-powered insights that justify the business model.

Business Context:
- Chat represents 90% of platform value delivery
- Users pay for AI-powered optimization insights, not just chat functionality
- Response quality directly impacts user retention and revenue
- Substantive responses drive conversion from Free -> Paid tiers

Success Criteria:
- Responses contain actionable business insights
- AI provides domain-specific expertise (AI cost optimization)
- Users receive value that justifies subscription costs
- Chat delivers measurable business outcomes, not just technical success
