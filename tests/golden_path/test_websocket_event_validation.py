"""
WebSocket Event Validation Test - Issue #1278 Phase 4

This test validates that all 5 critical WebSocket events are properly delivered
during agent execution, ensuring the golden path user experience is maintained.

Critical Events for Business Value:
1. agent_started - User sees AI began work
2. agent_thinking - Real-time reasoning visibility
3. tool_executing - Tool usage transparency
4. tool_completed - Tool results display
5. agent_completed - Final results ready

Business Impact: These events represent the user experience transparency that
drives trust and engagement, directly impacting the 90% platform value through chat.
