GitHub Issue #263 Broken Patterns Demonstration
===============================================

This file demonstrates the BROKEN patterns that were causing the issue.
These tests show what FAILS and WHY, providing concrete evidence of the problem.

The goal is to show:
1. BROKEN: setUp() instead of setup_method() with SSOT classes
2. BROKEN: ExecutionResult with old parameters (success=True, agent_name=..., etc.)
3. BROKEN: Missing golden_user_context due to setup incompatibility
