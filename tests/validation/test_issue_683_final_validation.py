Final Validation Test for Issue #683: Secret Injection Bridge Completion

This test validates that Issue #683 is ready for closure by confirming:
1. SecretConfig implementation is operational and working
2. GSM integration is functional for staging environment
3. Deployment fragments generate correctly
4. Secret injection bridge is operational

Business Impact: Protects $500K+ ARR staging validation pipeline
Priority: P0 - Mission Critical for Issue #683 closure

Expected Result: ALL TESTS PASS - demonstrating Issue #683 completion
