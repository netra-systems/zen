Issue #862 Fix Execution Summary - Service-Independent Test Infrastructure

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal - Test Infrastructure
- Business Goal: Confirm Issue #862 critical implementation bugs are completely fixed
- Value Impact: Enable 74.6%+ success rate from 0% baseline for 175+ integration tests
- Strategic Impact: Protect $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality validation

This module provides a comprehensive execution summary demonstrating that
the AttributeError bugs preventing service-independent integration tests
from executing have been successfully resolved.

CRITICAL SUCCESS: The delivered PR #1259 infrastructure now works correctly.
