Issue #862 Fix Validation Tests - Service-Independent Test Infrastructure

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal - Test Infrastructure
- Business Goal: Validate that Issue #862 critical implementation bugs are fixed
- Value Impact: Enable 74.6%+ success rate from 0% baseline
- Strategic Impact: Protect $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality validation

This module validates that the critical AttributeError bugs preventing execution
of service-independent integration tests have been successfully fixed.

CRITICAL: These tests confirm the delivered PR #1259 infrastructure now works correctly.
