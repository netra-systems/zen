Agent Event Delivery Failure Tests - TDD Approach



Issue #280: WebSocket authentication failure - P0 CRITICAL affecting $500K+ ARR



This test suite validates that all 5 critical WebSocket agent events fail to deliver

due to the RFC 6455 subprotocol violation, demonstrating the direct business impact

of the missing subprotocol parameter in websocket.accept() calls.



Critical Business Events Blocked:

1. agent_started - User sees agent began processing

2. agent_thinking - Real-time reasoning visibility  

3. tool_executing - Tool usage transparency

4. tool_completed - Tool results display

5. agent_completed - User knows response is ready



Business Impact:

- $500K+ ARR Golden Path completely blocked

- Chat functionality (90% of platform value) non-functional

- Real-time AI interaction experience broken

- User engagement and retention severely impacted



Root Cause Chain:

WebSocket connection fails (Error 1006)  ->  No event delivery channel  ->  All agent events lost



TDD Strategy:

1. Create tests showing agent events cannot be delivered due to connection failure

2. Mock successful agent execution but failing WebSocket delivery

3. Demonstrate that business value is blocked by technical RFC 6455 violation
