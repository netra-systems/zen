SSOT Performance Tests Package



This package contains performance tests for validating SSOT (Single Source of Truth) 

performance characteristics and optimization. Tests are designed to FAIL initially 

to prove performance issues with current fragmented implementations, then PASS after 

SSOT optimization.



Performance Coverage:

- SSOT vs fragmented performance comparison

- Memory usage optimization validation

- Concurrent performance under load

- Cross-service latency optimization

- Resource utilization comparison



Thresholds:

- Max 5% logging overhead

- Max 50MB memory increase

- Max 10ms latency per operation

- Min 1000 logs/sec throughput
