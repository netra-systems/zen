WebSocket Connection Speed Validation Tests



Business Value Justification (BVJ):

- Segment: All users - Core chat functionality

- Business Goal: Ensure WebSocket connections remain responsive 

- Value Impact: Protect 90% of platform value (chat responsiveness)

- Strategic Impact: Prevent user abandonment due to slow connections



This test validates the recent timeout optimizations that reduced

connection times from potentially 85s to target <5s.
