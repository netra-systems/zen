WebSocket Performance Validation Test



BUSINESS CRITICAL: Validates that the performance fixes actually resolve

the user-reported WebSocket slowdown issues.



FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. Reduced WebSocket SSOT timeout from 30s to 5s  

2. Reduced startup wait timeout from 20s max to 3s max

3. Reduced service validation timeouts from 20s/10s/5s to 3s/2s/1s

4. Total maximum blocking time reduced from 65s to ~11s



Expected performance improvement: 5-6x faster WebSocket connections



Business Value Justification:

- Segment: ALL (Free -> Enterprise)

- Business Goal: Restore chat performance to acceptable levels

- Value Impact: Fast chat connections = better user experience = higher retention

- Revenue Impact: Prevents user abandonment due to slow connections
