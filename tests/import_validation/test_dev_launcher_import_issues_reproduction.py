REPRODUCTION TEST: Dev Launcher Import Issues

PURPOSE: Demonstrate SSOT migration issues with dev_launcher imports.
These tests are designed to FAIL and reproduce the exact import errors
that occur when code still tries to import from dev_launcher.isolated_environment.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- All tests in this file should FAIL with ImportError
- Errors demonstrate incomplete SSOT migration
- Tests prove that dev_launcher.isolated_environment imports don't work

ROOT CAUSE: 
Incomplete SSOT migration - code still tries to import from dev_launcher
instead of shared.isolated_environment.

PROBLEMATIC FILES IDENTIFIED:
1. netra_backend/app/core/configuration/demo.py:8
2. tests/integration/execution_engine_ssot/test_configuration_integration.py:129

Business Impact: Platform/Internal - System Stability
Prevents import errors that could break configuration system.
