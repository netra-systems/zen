# Test Suite Implementation Plan: JWT Secret Synchronization

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Test 1: JWT Creation and Cross-Service Validation
- Create JWT in Auth service
- Validate same JWT in Backend service
- Validate same JWT in WebSocket service
- Verify all services accept the token

### Test 2: JWT Secret Rotation
- Rotate JWT secret in configuration
- Verify all services pick up new secret
- Ensure old tokens are rejected
- Ensure new tokens with new secret work

### Test 3: Mismatched Secret Handling
- Configure services with different secrets
- Verify token from one service rejected by others
- Ensure proper error messages returned
- Test recovery when secrets are synchronized

### Test 4: Performance Validation
- Measure JWT validation time across services
- Ensure <50ms validation requirement met
- Test under concurrent load
- Verify no performance degradation

### Test 5: Edge Cases
- Test with expired tokens across services
- Test with malformed tokens
- Test with missing claims
- Test with clock skew between services

## Implementation Requirements
- Use UnifiedTestHarness for multi-service coordination
- Mock services where appropriate for isolation
- Include performance benchmarks
- Follow AAA pattern
- Include BVJ documentation
- Maximum 300 lines per test file
