# Test Suite 6: Database User Consistency - Implementation Plan

## Test Overview
**File**: `tests/unified/test_database_user_consistency.py`
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Business Impact**: $80K+ MRR
**Performance Target**: < 1 second sync time

## Core Functionality to Test
1. Create user in Auth service
2. Verify user exists in Auth PostgreSQL
3. Verify user synced to Backend PostgreSQL
4. Update user profile in Auth
5. Verify update propagated to Backend
6. Delete user and verify cascade

## Test Cases (minimum 5 required)

1. **User Creation Sync** - User created in Auth appears in Backend DB
2. **Profile Update Propagation** - Profile changes sync across databases
3. **User Deletion Cascade** - Deletion in Auth cascades to Backend
4. **Data Integrity Validation** - All user fields sync correctly
5. **Sync Performance** - Database sync < 1 second
6. **Concurrent User Operations** - Multiple users don't interfere
7. **Transaction Consistency** - Operations are atomic across DBs

## Success Criteria
- Data consistency 100%
- Sync time < 1 second
- No data corruption
- Cascade deletion works
- Transaction integrity
