# WebSocket Test 3: Message Queuing During Disconnection - Test Plan

## Overview
This test suite validates that messages sent by the agent while the client is briefly disconnected are queued and delivered in the correct order upon reconnection. This is critical for ensuring no data loss during temporary network disruptions.

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)
- **Segment:** Enterprise, Mid
- **Business Goal:** Retention, Stability
- **Value Impact:** Prevents data loss during network instability, maintains session continuity
- **Strategic/Revenue Impact:** Reduces customer churn due to lost messages, improves platform reliability

## Test Architecture

### Core Components Required
1. **Message Queue Manager** - Handles queuing of outbound messages during disconnection
2. **Connection State Monitor** - Tracks client connection status
3. **Message Ordering System** - Ensures FIFO delivery of queued messages
4. **Queue Overflow Handler** - Manages queue size limits and overflow scenarios
5. **Message Priority System** - Handles different message types with varying priorities

### Queue Management Requirements
- **Queue Size Limit:** 1000 messages per session
- **Message TTL:** 5 minutes for standard messages, 30 minutes for critical messages
- **Priority Levels:** Critical (system alerts), High (user requests), Normal (status updates)
- **Ordering:** FIFO within priority levels, priority-based between levels

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Single Message Queuing During Disconnection
**Objective:** Verify that a single message sent during disconnection is queued and delivered upon reconnection.

**Steps:**
1. Establish WebSocket connection
2. Send initial message to confirm communication
3. Simulate client disconnection (close WebSocket)
4. Trigger agent to send message while client is disconnected
5. Reconnect client within 30 seconds
6. Verify queued message is delivered immediately upon reconnection
7. Confirm message content and timestamp accuracy

**Expected Results:**
- Message is queued during disconnection
- Message is delivered within 1 second of reconnection
- Message content is intact and includes original timestamp
- Queue is empty after successful delivery

### Test Case 2: Multiple Messages Queuing with Order Preservation
**Objective:** Ensure multiple messages are queued in correct order and delivered sequentially.

**Steps:**
1. Establish WebSocket connection
2. Simulate client disconnection
3. Trigger agent to send 5 messages in sequence (with 500ms intervals)
4. Wait 3 seconds to ensure all messages are queued
5. Reconnect client
6. Verify all 5 messages are delivered in correct order
7. Check timing between message deliveries (should be rapid but ordered)

**Expected Results:**
- All 5 messages are queued successfully
- Messages are delivered in exact sending order
- No message duplication or loss
- Delivery timing maintains order (message N+1 after message N)

### Test Case 3: Queue Overflow Handling and Limits
**Objective:** Test behavior when message queue exceeds configured limits.

**Steps:**
1. Configure queue limit to 10 messages for testing
2. Establish WebSocket connection
3. Simulate client disconnection
4. Trigger agent to send 15 messages rapidly
5. Verify queue behavior at limit (oldest messages dropped or error handling)
6. Reconnect client
7. Verify appropriate messages are delivered based on overflow policy

**Expected Results:**
- Queue accepts exactly 10 messages
- Overflow handling follows configured policy (drop oldest/newest or reject)
- Client receives appropriate messages upon reconnection
- System logs overflow events appropriately

### Test Case 4: Priority Message Handling During Queue
**Objective:** Validate that high-priority messages are handled correctly during queuing.

**Steps:**
1. Establish WebSocket connection
2. Simulate client disconnection
3. Send 3 normal priority messages
4. Send 2 high priority messages
5. Send 2 more normal priority messages
6. Reconnect client
7. Verify high priority messages are delivered before normal messages
8. Confirm order within same priority level is maintained

**Expected Results:**
- High priority messages are delivered first
- Within same priority, FIFO order is maintained
- All messages are delivered successfully
- Priority handling doesn't cause message loss

### Test Case 5: Queue Expiration and Cleanup
**Objective:** Test that expired messages are properly cleaned up from the queue.

**Steps:**
1. Configure message TTL to 2 seconds for testing
2. Establish WebSocket connection
3. Simulate client disconnection
4. Trigger agent to send 3 messages
5. Wait 3 seconds (beyond TTL)
6. Trigger agent to send 2 more messages
7. Reconnect client immediately
8. Verify only non-expired messages (last 2) are delivered

**Expected Results:**
- Expired messages are automatically removed from queue
- Only fresh messages (within TTL) are delivered
- Queue cleanup happens automatically
- No memory leaks from expired message retention

## Additional Edge Case Scenarios

### Rapid Disconnect/Reconnect Cycles
- Test behavior during multiple quick disconnection/reconnection cycles
- Verify queue doesn't accumulate stale messages
- Ensure system performance under rapid state changes

### Concurrent Message Sending
- Multiple agents sending messages to same disconnected client
- Verify thread safety of queue operations
- Test message interleaving from different sources

### System Resource Constraints
- Test queue behavior under low memory conditions
- Verify graceful degradation when system resources are limited
- Monitor queue performance metrics

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Zero Message Loss:** All messages sent during disconnection are preserved
2. **Order Preservation:** Messages maintain sending order within priority levels
3. **Priority Handling:** Higher priority messages are delivered first
4. **Resource Management:** Queue limits and TTL are respected
5. **Performance:** Message delivery upon reconnection is immediate (<1s)

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Memory Efficiency:** Queue memory usage scales linearly with message count
2. **Thread Safety:** Concurrent queue operations don't cause data corruption
3. **Observability:** Queue metrics are available for monitoring
4. **Resilience:** Queue survives service restarts (if configured for persistence)

## Implementation Notes

### WebSocket Manager Extensions Required
- Add message queue storage mechanism
- Implement connection state tracking
- Create message priority and TTL handling
- Add queue overflow policies

### Monitoring and Metrics
- Queue depth per session
- Message delivery latency
- Queue overflow events
- Message expiration counts

### Configuration Parameters
```yaml
websocket_queue:
  max_queue_size: 1000
  default_ttl_seconds: 300
  critical_ttl_seconds: 1800
  delivery_batch_size: 10
  overflow_policy: "drop_oldest"
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Memory Leaks:** Unbounded queue growth if cleanup fails
2. **Performance Impact:** Large queues affecting system performance
3. **Message Corruption:** Concurrent access to queue structures
4. **State Inconsistency:** Queue state not matching connection state

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Implement comprehensive queue size monitoring
2. Add circuit breaker for queue operations
3. Use thread-safe data structures for queue implementation
4. Regular queue health checks and cleanup routines

## Dependencies
- Existing WebSocket infrastructure
- Message serialization/deserialization
- Connection state management
- Metrics collection system
- Configuration management

This comprehensive test plan ensures robust message queuing functionality that maintains data integrity and user experience during network disruptions.
