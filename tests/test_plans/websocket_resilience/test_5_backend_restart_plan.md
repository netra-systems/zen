# WebSocket Test 5: Backend Service Restart Recovery Implementation Plan

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)
- **Segment:** Enterprise, Growth  
- **Business Goal:** Zero-downtime deployment capability enabling continuous service availability
- **Value Impact:** Ensures enterprise customers experience seamless service during rolling deployments and server restarts
- **Strategic/Revenue Impact:** Prevents $100K+ MRR churn from enterprise customers due to service interruptions during maintenance

## Overview

This test suite validates the client-side recovery mechanism when the backend server restarts (e.g., during deployment), ensuring clients automatically reconnect and restore their session state without user intervention.

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Graceful Server Shutdown with Client Notification
**Scenario:** Server sends graceful shutdown signal before restart  
**Client Behavior:** Receives shutdown notification, attempts reconnection with exponential backoff  
**Expected Outcome:** Client successfully reconnects within 10 seconds, session state preserved  
**Business Impact:** Reduces customer support tickets during planned maintenance by 90%

**Test Steps:**
1. Establish WebSocket connection with active session
2. Server sends graceful shutdown notification with restart hint
3. Server gracefully closes all connections
4. Client receives shutdown signal and enters reconnection mode
5. Client attempts reconnection with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
6. Server comes back online, client reconnects successfully
7. Validate session state and context preservation

### Test Case 2: Unexpected Server Crash Recovery
**Scenario:** Server crashes unexpectedly without notification  
**Client Behavior:** Detects connection loss, implements aggressive reconnection strategy  
**Expected Outcome:** Client recovers within 30 seconds, maintains data integrity  
**Business Impact:** Ensures service continuity during unexpected failures

**Test Steps:**
1. Establish WebSocket connection with ongoing conversation
2. Simulate server crash (immediate connection termination)
3. Client detects connection loss through ping timeout
4. Client enters emergency reconnection mode with faster retry (500ms, 1s, 2s, 4s)
5. Server restarts and becomes available
6. Client successfully reconnects and requests state restoration
7. Validate conversation history and agent context preservation

### Test Case 3: Rolling Deployment Reconnection
**Scenario:** Rolling deployment with multiple server instances  
**Client Behavior:** Connects to new server instance during deployment  
**Expected Outcome:** Seamless handoff between server instances  
**Business Impact:** Enables zero-downtime deployments for enterprise SLA compliance

**Test Steps:**
1. Connect to server instance A with established session
2. Begin rolling deployment process
3. Load balancer redirects traffic to server instance B
4. Client connection to A is gracefully terminated
5. Client automatically connects to server instance B
6. Session state is retrieved from shared storage/database
7. Validate seamless continuation without data loss

### Test Case 4: Client Backoff Strategy During Restart
**Scenario:** Server is unavailable for extended period during restart  
**Client Behavior:** Implements exponential backoff with maximum retry limits  
**Expected Outcome:** Client doesn't overwhelm server during restart, connects when available  
**Business Impact:** Prevents server overload during restart, ensures stable recovery

**Test Steps:**
1. Establish baseline connection
2. Server becomes unavailable for extended period (2+ minutes)
3. Client implements exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s, 60s
4. Client respects maximum retry intervals and doesn't exceed rate limits
5. Server becomes available after extended downtime
6. Client successfully connects on next retry attempt
7. Validate backoff strategy effectiveness and resource usage

### Test Case 5: State Preservation Across Server Restarts
**Scenario:** Complex session state must survive server restart  
**Client Behavior:** Restores complete session including agent context, conversation history, and tool state  
**Expected Outcome:** Full session restoration with 100% state preservation  
**Business Impact:** Ensures enterprise customers don't lose work during maintenance windows

**Test Steps:**
1. Establish complex session with:
   - Multi-turn conversation (10+ messages)
   - Agent memory and context variables
   - Tool call history and pending operations
   - User preferences and workflow state
2. Server restart process begins
3. Client gracefully disconnects and waits for server availability
4. Server restarts with fresh process and state
5. Client reconnects with session token
6. Server restores session from persistent storage
7. Validate complete state restoration:
   - All conversation messages present and ordered
   - Agent memory variables intact
   - Tool call history preserved
   - Workflow state continues from correct step

## Performance Requirements

- **Graceful Reconnection Time:** < 10 seconds
- **Emergency Reconnection Time:** < 30 seconds
- **Rolling Deployment Handoff:** < 5 seconds
- **State Restoration Time:** < 2 seconds
- **Maximum Backoff Interval:** 60 seconds
- **Resource Usage During Backoff:** < 1% CPU, < 10MB memory
