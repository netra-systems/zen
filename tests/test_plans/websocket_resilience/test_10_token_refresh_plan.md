# Test 10: Token Refresh over WebSocket - Test Plan

## Overview
**Test ID**: WS-RESILIENCE-010  
**Test Type**: WebSocket Authentication  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Duration**: 35 seconds  

## Objective
Validate JWT token refresh over existing WebSocket connection without requiring full disconnect, ensuring seamless authentication renewal for long-running sessions.

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)
- **Segment**: Enterprise (long-running sessions, security compliance)
- **Business Goal**: Seamless authentication without session disruption
- **Value Impact**: Prevents forced disconnections during token expiry
- **Strategic Impact**: Enables $150K+ MRR from enterprise customers requiring continuous sessions

## Test Scenario
Test token refresh functionality:
1. Establish WebSocket connection with initial JWT token
2. Simulate token approaching expiry
3. Perform in-session token refresh without disconnection
4. Validate new token acceptance and session continuity
5. Test failed refresh scenarios and error handling

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Token refresh without connection interruption
- ✅ Session state preserved during refresh
- ✅ New token properly validated and accepted
- ✅ Graceful handling of refresh failures
- ✅ Security maintained throughout process

## Implementation Notes
- Mock JWT token generation and validation
- Simulate token expiry timing
- Test both successful and failed refresh scenarios
- Validate security and session continuity
