## Initial Test Run Results

### Failures Encountered

1. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - Tests attempted to use `extra_headers` parameter with websockets library
   - Error: `BaseEventLoop.create_connection() got an unexpected keyword argument 'extra_headers'`
   - Status: ❌ 5 tests failing due to connection issues

2. **Async/Await Issues**
   - Test fixtures incorrectly awaiting non-async mock methods
   - Error: `TypeError: object list can't be used in 'await' expression`
   - Status: ❌ Tests failing on mock context retrieval

3. **Missing Message Handlers**
   - System lacked handlers for `get_conversation_history` and `get_agent_context` message types
   - Tests expecting specific WebSocket responses that weren't implemented
   - Status: ❌ Core functionality missing

4. **Mock Configuration Issues**
   - WebSocket test client mocks not properly configured to return expected responses
   - JSON parsing errors from mock responses
   - Status: ❌ Test infrastructure problems

## System Architecture Enhancements

### Message Processing Pipeline

The WebSocket system now properly handles:

1. **Message Routing** - Routes `get_conversation_history` and `get_agent_context` to appropriate handlers
2. **Context Storage** - Retrieves conversation history from database threads
3. **Agent Memory** - Constructs agent context with memory, workflow state, and tool history
4. **Error Handling** - Provides proper error responses for failed operations
5. **Session Management** - Maintains session token associations with context data

### Integration Points

- **Agent Service Core** - Routes WebSocket messages to specialized handlers
- **Message Handler Service** - Implements conversation and context retrieval logic
- **Thread Service** - Provides conversation history from database
- **WebSocket Manager** - Sends responses back to clients
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error reporting and user notifications
