## Performance SLA Requirements

| Metric | Target | Maximum |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Per-agent CPU usage | < 25% | < 50% |
| Per-agent Memory usage | < 512MB | < 1GB |
| Resource isolation violations | 0 | 0 |
| Cross-tenant data leaks | 0 | 0 |
| Performance degradation | < 10% | < 25% |
