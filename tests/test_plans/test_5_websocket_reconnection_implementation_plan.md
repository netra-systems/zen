# Test Suite 5: WebSocket Reconnection State - Implementation Plan

## Test Overview
**File**: `tests/unified/test_websocket_reconnection_state.py`
**Priority**: HIGH
**Business Impact**: $60K+ MRR
**Performance Target**: < 2 seconds reconnection

## Core Functionality to Test
1. Establish WebSocket connection with JWT
2. Send messages and build state
3. Force disconnect (network failure)
4. Reconnect with same JWT
5. Verify state restored correctly
6. Message queue preserved
7. Auth context maintained

## Test Cases (minimum 5 required)

1. **Basic Reconnection Flow** - Disconnect and reconnect preserves state
2. **Message Queue Preservation** - Pending messages delivered after reconnect
3. **Auth Context Persistence** - JWT and user context maintained
4. **State Snapshot Recovery** - Full state restored after reconnect
5. **Multiple Reconnections** - Handles repeated disconnects gracefully
6. **Reconnection Performance** - Reconnect < 2 seconds
7. **Concurrent Message Handling** - Messages during reconnect handled properly

## Success Criteria
- State fully preserved
- Message queue intact
- < 2 second reconnection
- Auth context maintained
- No data loss
