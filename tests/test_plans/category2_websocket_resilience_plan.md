# Test Suite Implementation Plan: WebSocket Resilience and State Management

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)
- **Segment:** Platform/Internal, All Customer Segments
- **Business Goal:** Customer Retention, User Experience Stability
- **Value Impact:** Prevents 5-10% churn from connection issues, maintains real-time experience
- **Strategic/Revenue Impact:** $50K+ MRR protection from reliable real-time features

## Test Suite Structure

### Test 1: Client Reconnection Preserves Context
**Purpose:** Validate conversation continuity after disconnection
**Components:** WebSocket Server, Session Management, Redis
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Currently 0% coverage, user experience impact

### Test 2: Mid-Stream Disconnection and Recovery
**Purpose:** Ensure response delivery completes after network issues
**Components:** WebSocket Server, Message Queue, Agent State
**Priority:** HIGH - Data loss prevention

### Test 3: Message Queuing During Disconnection
**Purpose:** Prevent message loss during brief outages
**Components:** Message Queue, WebSocket Server
**Priority:** HIGH - Data integrity

### Test 4: Backend Service Restart Recovery
**Purpose:** Automatic reconnection after deployments
**Components:** WebSocket Client, Service Discovery
**Priority:** HIGH - Zero-downtime deployments

### Test 5: Rapid Reconnection (Flapping) Handling
**Purpose:** Prevent resource exhaustion from unstable connections
**Components:** WebSocket Server, Rate Limiting
**Priority:** MEDIUM - System stability

### Test 6: WebSocket Heartbeat Validation
**Purpose:** Detect and clean up zombie connections
**Components:** WebSocket Server, Ping/Pong
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Resource management

### Test 7: Token Refresh over WebSocket
**Purpose:** Seamless authentication renewal
**Components:** WebSocket Server, Auth Service
**Priority:** MEDIUM - User experience

## Implementation Strategy
1. Create WebSocket test harness with controlled disconnection
2. Implement state preservation validation
3. Add message queue verification
4. Create network simulation utilities
5. Integrate with existing E2E framework

## Success Criteria
- 100% message delivery guarantee
- < 2 second reconnection time
- Zero duplicate agent instances
- Proper cleanup of zombie connections
