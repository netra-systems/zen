Demo Mode Circuit Breaker Relaxed Tests

BUSINESS VALUE: Free Segment - Demo Environment Usability  
GOAL: Conversion - Prevent demo lockouts from failed authentication attempts
VALUE IMPACT: Ensures demo users can recover from mistakes without permanent lockout
REVENUE IMPACT: Prevents demo abandonment due to authentication lockouts

These tests verify that circuit breaker behavior is more relaxed in demo mode.
Initial status: THESE TESTS WILL FAIL - they demonstrate current restrictive behavior.

Tests cover:
1. Higher failure threshold (10 vs 5 failures)
2. Shorter timeout duration (30s vs 60s)
3. Faster recovery in half-open state
4. Demo-specific circuit breaker policies
5. Bypass circuit breaker for demo users
