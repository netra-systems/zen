"""
Demo Mode Authentication Tests

This module contains comprehensive tests for the demo mode authentication system.
These tests verify permissive authentication behavior for demo environments
while maintaining security in production environments.

All tests in this module should INITIALLY FAIL, demonstrating the current
restrictive behavior. Once demo mode features are implemented, these tests
should pass.
