Demo Mode User Creation Flexible Tests



BUSINESS VALUE: Free Segment - Demo Environment Usability

GOAL: Conversion - Simplify user registration for demo evaluation

VALUE IMPACT: Eliminates registration friction preventing demo completion

REVENUE IMPACT: Higher demo engagement leads to increased conversion rates



These tests verify that user creation is more flexible in demo mode.

Initial status: THESE TESTS WILL FAIL - they demonstrate current restrictive behavior.



Tests cover:

1. Simple password requirements (4 chars vs complex requirements)

2. Simple email validation (test@test vs complex validation)

3. Auto-user creation from JWT claims

4. Default demo users available

5. Bypass email verification in demo mode
