"""ISSUE #411 VALIDATION TESTS - Docker Fast-Fail Validation



MISSION: Validate that Docker timeout fixes work correctly after implementation.



These tests should PASS after Issue #411 fixes are applied.



SOLUTION VALIDATION:

- Docker availability checks complete in < 2s when Docker unavailable

- WebSocket tests skip gracefully instead of hanging

- Rate limiter implements proper fast-fail logic
