# FAILING TEST GARDENER WORKLOG - ALL_TESTS
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Focus:** ALL_TESTS (unit, integration non-docker, e2e staging tests)  
**Objective:** Figure out the least well covered most critical parts  

## Executive Summary
Systematic analysis of test failures and coverage gaps across the Netra platform, focusing on identifying critical business areas with poor test coverage that pose risk to the $500K+ ARR.

## Critical Business Areas Analyzed
Based on CLAUDE.md and reports, the following are identified as most critical:

### 1. **Chat Functionality (90% of Platform Value)**
- **Business Impact:** Core revenue driver - $500K+ ARR dependent
- **Components:** WebSocket events, agent orchestration, user responses
- **Coverage Status:** INVESTIGATING

### 2. **WebSocket Agent Events (Mission Critical)**
- **Business Impact:** Enables real-time chat experience
- **Required Events:** agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, tool_completed, agent_completed
- **Coverage Status:** INVESTIGATING

### 3. **Authentication System (Security Critical)**
- **Business Impact:** Enterprise customers ($15K+ MRR per customer)
- **Components:** JWT validation, OAuth, multi-tenant isolation
- **Coverage Status:** INVESTIGATING

### 4. **Agent Execution Core (Business Logic)**
- **Business Impact:** AI response quality and reliability
- **Components:** ExecutionState handling, supervisor orchestration
- **Coverage Status:** INVESTIGATING

## Test Execution Log

### Initial Comprehensive Test Run
**Command:** `python tests/unified_test_runner.py --categories unit integration api --no-coverage --no-docker --verbose`
**Status:** TIMEOUT (>2 minutes)
**Observation:** Tests are starting but execution is slow, syntax validation passed for 4956 files

### Targeted Analysis Strategy
Moving to focused testing of critical components to identify specific failures.

## Discovered Issues

### Issue #1: Critical Docker Infrastructure Failure (MISSION CRITICAL)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Category:** failing-test-infrastructure-critical
**Test File:** `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`
**Description:** Mission critical WebSocket tests cannot run due to Docker service configuration mismatch
**Root Causes:**
1. Docker compose file has `test-backend`/`test-auth` but code expects `backend`/`auth`
2. Missing base Docker images: `python:3.11-alpine`, `python:3.11-alpine3.19`, `node:18-alpine`, `clickhouse/clickhouse-server:23-alpine`
3. Missing `docker_startup_timeout` attribute in `RealWebSocketTestConfig`
**Business Impact:** 
- **CRITICAL**: Cannot validate $500K+ ARR WebSocket functionality
- **CRITICAL**: 5 required WebSocket events (agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, tool_completed, agent_completed) cannot be tested
- **CRITICAL**: Real-time chat experience validation blocked
**Error Details:**
```
RuntimeError: Failed to start Docker services for WebSocket testing
no such service: backend
'RealWebSocketTestConfig' object has no attribute 'docker_startup_timeout'
```
**Next Action:** Create GitHub issue for Docker infrastructure fix

### Issue #2: Test Execution Timeout  
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** infrastructure
**Description:** Comprehensive test suite times out, preventing full analysis
**Impact:** Cannot get complete picture of test health
**Next Action:** Break down into smaller test chunks

## Coverage Gap Analysis

### Most Critical Areas Needing Investigation
1. **WebSocket Silent Failures** - Recent critical issue resolved, need validation
2. **User Context Manager** - P0 security issue recently implemented, needs coverage validation  
3. **Golden Path User Flow** - End-to-end user journey protection
4. **Agent Execution State Management** - Recent ExecutionState bug fixes need coverage
5. **Import Registry Compliance** - SSOT violations prevention

## Next Actions
1. Run targeted tests on each critical component
2. Identify specific failing tests and coverage gaps
3. Create GitHub issues for each discovered problem
4. Prioritize fixes based on business impact
