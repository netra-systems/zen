# FAILING-TEST-GARDENER-WORKLOG: E2E Golden Tests
**Date:** 2025-09-11  
**Time:** 12:37:15  
**Test Focus:** e2e golden  
**Scope:** End-to-end Golden Path tests critical for $500K+ ARR business value  

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Critical Business Impact:** Multiple e2e golden path tests are failing, blocking validation of core revenue-generating user flows that protect $500K+ ARR.

**Issues Discovered:** 3 primary issue categories affecting different golden path test types
**Test Collection Status:** All tested files can be collected successfully  
**Test Execution Status:** All executed tests are failing with infrastructure-related errors

---

## DISCOVERED ISSUES

### ðŸš¨ ISSUE #1: Service Dependency Connection Failures
**Severity:** P0 - Critical/Blocking  
**Category:** failing-test-regression-P0-service-dependencies  
**Impact:** Complete e2e golden path testing blocked

**Test Files Affected:**
- `tests/e2e/golden_path/test_complete_golden_path_business_value.py`
- Multiple other WebSocket-dependent e2e tests

**Error Details:**
```
ConnectionError: Failed to create WebSocket connection after 3 attempts: [WinError 1225] The remote computer refused the network connection

Auth service connection failure:
- Cannot connect to host localhost:8083 ssl:default [The remote computer refused the network connection]
- Fallback to staging-compatible JWT creation works
- WebSocket connection to ws://localhost:8002/ws fails
```

**Root Cause:** Required services (auth service on port 8083, backend WebSocket on port 8002) not running during test execution

**Business Value Impact:** 
- Cannot validate complete user journey that generates $500K+ ARR
- Golden path business value delivery cannot be tested
- Core chat functionality validation blocked

**Test Classification:** `failing-test-regression-P0-service-dependencies`

---

### ðŸš¨ ISSUE #2: Async Context Manager Protocol Error  
**Severity:** P1 - High  
**Category:** failing-test-new-P1-async-protocol  
**Impact:** WebSocket chat golden path tests failing

**Test Files Affected:**
- `tests/e2e/test_golden_path_websocket_chat.py`

**Error Details:**
```
AssertionError: CRITICAL FAILURE: Golden Path chat message could not be sent. This indicates complete WebSocket infrastructure failure. Core business value delivery is blocked.

Underlying error: 'coroutine' object does not support the asynchronous context manager protocol
```

**Root Cause:** Async/await pattern issue in WebSocket test infrastructure - coroutine not properly awaited or context managed

**Business Value Impact:**
- Core chat functionality validation blocked
- WebSocket event delivery cannot be tested
- Agent execution transparency features untested

**Test Classification:** `failing-test-new-P1-async-protocol`

---

### ðŸš¨ ISSUE #3: Staging Environment Validator Architectural Issues
**Severity:** P2 - Medium  
**Category:** failing-test-active-dev-P2-staging-validator  
**Impact:** Staging deployment validation tests affected

**Test Files Affected:**
- `tests/e2e/staging/test_golden_path_validation_staging_current.py`
- Potentially other staging validation tests

**Error Details:**
```
DESIGNED TO FAIL: Tests that show validator fails even when services work correctly

CRITICAL ISSUE: The validator makes monolithic assumptions about database
schema that don't hold in a properly separated microservice environment.
```

**Root Cause:** Golden Path Validator has architectural flaws - assumes monolithic database schema but services are properly separated

**Business Value Impact:**
- Staging deployments may be blocked by incorrect validator failures
- Healthy services incorrectly flagged as failing
- Deployment velocity reduced by false validation failures

**Test Classification:** `failing-test-active-dev-P2-staging-validator`

---

## COMMON PATTERNS OBSERVED

### Service Dependencies
- **Pattern:** Multiple e2e golden tests depend on local services running (ports 8083, 8002)
- **Impact:** Cannot execute true e2e validation without service orchestration
- **Recommendation:** Tests need service startup automation or staging environment targeting

### WebSocket Infrastructure
- **Pattern:** WebSocket connection and event handling has multiple failure modes
- **Impact:** Core business value delivery validation blocked
- **Recommendation:** WebSocket test infrastructure needs debugging and hardening

### Staging Environment Integration
- **Pattern:** Staging-specific tests reveal architectural validator issues
- **Impact:** Deployment validation may have false negatives
- **Recommendation:** Validator architecture needs review for microservice compatibility

---

## BUSINESS IMPACT ASSESSMENT

**Revenue Risk:** HIGH - $500K+ ARR golden path cannot be validated  
**Customer Impact:** HIGH - Core chat functionality validation blocked  
**Deployment Risk:** MEDIUM - Staging validation may have false failures  
**Development Velocity:** HIGH - E2E golden path testing completely blocked

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Issue #1 (P0):** Create GitHub issue for service dependency automation in e2e tests
2. **Issue #2 (P1):** Create GitHub issue for async context manager protocol fix  
3. **Issue #3 (P2):** Create GitHub issue for staging validator architectural review

Each issue requires:
- SNST (Spawn New Subagent Task) for detailed investigation
- GitHub issue creation with appropriate priority tags
- Linking to related issues/PRs/documentation
- Technical remediation plan
