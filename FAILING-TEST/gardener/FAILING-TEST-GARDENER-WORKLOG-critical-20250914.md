# FAILING TEST GARDENER WORKLOG - CRITICAL TESTS
**Date:** 2025-09-14
**Focus:** Critical Tests
**Agent:** Failing Test Gardener

## Executive Summary
Discovered 3 critical failing tests in mission critical WebSocket agent events test suite. These failures impact $500K+ ARR core chat functionality and require immediate attention.

## Discovered Issues

### Issue 1: WebSocket Agent Started Event Structure Validation Failure
**Test:** `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py::TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_agent_started_event_structure`
**Status:** FAILING
**Error:** `AssertionError: agent_started event structure validation failed`
**Business Impact:** HIGH - Core chat functionality, $500K+ ARR impact
**Priority:** P1 - High
**Description:** The agent_started event structure validation is failing, which could prevent users from seeing when agents begin processing their requests.

### Issue 2: WebSocket Tool Executing Event Missing Tool Name
**Test:** `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py::TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_tool_executing_event_structure`
**Status:** FAILING
**Error:** `AssertionError: tool_executing missing tool_name`
**Business Impact:** HIGH - Tool transparency for users, core chat functionality
**Priority:** P1 - High
**Description:** The tool_executing event is missing the required `tool_name` field, preventing users from seeing what tools are being executed.

### Issue 3: WebSocket Tool Completed Event Missing Results
**Test:** `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py::TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_tool_completed_event_structure`
**Status:** FAILING
**Error:** `AssertionError: tool_completed missing results`
**Business Impact:** HIGH - Users cannot see tool execution results, impacts chat value delivery
**Priority:** P1 - High
**Description:** The tool_completed event is missing the required `results` field, preventing users from seeing the outcomes of tool executions.

## Business Context
All failing tests are related to the mission critical WebSocket agent events that provide real-time visibility into AI agent operations. These events are fundamental to the chat experience that delivers 90% of platform value ($500K+ ARR).
