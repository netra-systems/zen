# FAILING-TEST-GARDENER-WORKLOG - WebSocket Event Validation

**Date:** 2025-09-14
**Focus:** failing-test-regression-P1-websocket-event-validation-agent-started-structure
**Scope:** WebSocket agent event structure validation failures
**Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR chat functionality

---

## Issue Discovery Summary

**Discovered Issue:** Critical WebSocket agent event structure validation failures in mission critical test suite

### Test Execution Results
- **Test Suite:** tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py
- **Failing Tests:**
  - test_agent_started_event_structure
  - test_tool_executing_event_structure
  - test_tool_completed_event_structure
- **Error Pattern:** AssertionError: agent_started event structure validation failed
- **Root Cause:** WebSocket server returning connection metadata instead of structured agent events

### Business Impact Assessment
- **Revenue Risk:** $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality compromised
- **User Experience:** Real-time agent progress visibility broken
- **Chat Functionality:** Core transparency features non-functional
- **Priority Level:** P1 (High - major feature broken, significant user impact)

## Process Execution Log

### Step 0: Issue Search and Analysis
✅ **COMPLETED** - Found existing related issue #973: "failing-test-regression-p1-websocket-event-structure-validation"

**Discovery Results:**
- Issue #973 already tracks this exact problem with comprehensive documentation
- Multiple recent updates confirming persistent failures (10+ comments)
- Same failure pattern: WebSocket events returning 'connect' type instead of structured agent events
- Issue actively tracked with P1 Critical priority

### Step 1: Issue Coordination and Updates
✅ **COMPLETED** - Updated existing issue #973 with latest findings

**Actions Taken:**
- Added comprehensive comment with latest test execution results
- Confirmed business impact remains critical ($500K+ ARR)
- Validated WebSocket connection success but payload structure failures
- Linked related issues (#911, #935, #984, #960) for coordination

### Related Issues Identified
- **Issue #973:** Main tracking issue (UPDATED with latest findings)
- **Issue #911:** WebSocket server returns 'connect' events instead of expected types
- **Issue #935:** tool_completed missing results field
- **Issue #984:** WebSocket event structure incomplete fields (deferred)
- **Issue #960:** WebSocket manager fragmentation infrastructure cause

## Decision: No New Issue Required

**Rationale:**
- Exact issue already exists and is actively tracked (#973)
- Comprehensive documentation and business impact analysis already in place
- Multiple stakeholders already engaged with regular updates
- Creating duplicate would fragment tracking and resolution efforts

**Action:** Updated existing issue with latest technical findings and business impact confirmation

## Technical Details Confirmed

### Error Structure
```
AssertionError: agent_started event structure validation failed
Event received: {'correlation_id': None, 'data': {'connection_id': 'main_06056b0b', ...}, ...}
Expected: ['type', 'user_id', 'thread_id', 'timestamp'] fields
```

### WebSocket Connection Status
- **Connection:** ✅ Successful to staging environment
- **URL:** wss://netra-backend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app/api/v1/websocket
- **Infrastructure:** Working correctly
- **Problem:** Event payload structure not matching expectations

### Validation Framework
- **Validator:** MissionCriticalEventValidator with strict_mode=True
- **Expected Fields:** Agent-specific metadata and context
- **Actual Response:** Generic connection status information
- **Impact:** Users cannot see real-time agent progress or tool execution

## Completion Status

✅ **Issue Discovery:** Completed
✅ **Search for Existing Issues:** Completed
✅ **Issue Coordination:** Completed (Updated #973)
✅ **Related Issue Linking:** Completed
✅ **Business Impact Assessment:** Completed
✅ **Technical Analysis:** Completed

**Result:** Existing issue #973 properly updated with latest findings and continues to track this critical WebSocket event validation problem.
