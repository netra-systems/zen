# Failing Test Gardener Worklog - Critical Test Focus

**Created:** 2025-09-14 11:05:00
**Test Focus:** Critical tests (mission_critical directory and core infrastructure)
**Command:** `/failingtestsgardener critical`
**Session ID:** failing-test-gardener-20250914-110500

## Executive Summary

Discovered **3 critical failing tests** in the mission critical WebSocket agent events suite. All failures are related to **event structure validation issues** affecting the Golden Path user experience and $500K+ ARR business value.

**Impact Level:** ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL** - Core chat functionality affected
**Business Risk:** High - WebSocket events are critical for real-time user experience
**Testing Environment:** Staging (real WebSocket connections, no mocks)

## Test Execution Results

### âœ… Successful Test Discovery

## Technical Analysis

### Event Structure Issues
All failing tests are related to **WebSocket event structure validation**:

1. **Common Pattern:** Tests are receiving `connection_established` events instead of expected business events
2. **Root Cause:** Event routing or structure generation issues in WebSocket layer
3. **Validation Framework:** Custom `MissionCriticalEventValidator` is correctly identifying structural problems

### Connection Success
- **âœ… WebSocket Connections:** Successfully establishing connections to staging
- **âœ… Event Delivery:** Events are being delivered (but with wrong structure)
- **âœ… Test Infrastructure:** Test framework and validation logic working correctly

### System Context
- **Environment:** Staging GCP Cloud Run
- **WebSocket URL:** `wss://netra-backend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app/api/v1/websocket`
- **Authentication:** Connection establishment working
- **Resource Usage:** Peak memory 251.5 MB (within limits)

## Business Value Impact

### Golden Path Risk Assessment
- **User Experience:** Degraded real-time feedback during agent execution
- **Revenue Impact:** $500K+ ARR at risk due to poor chat experience quality
- **Customer Perception:** Missing critical progress indicators affects platform credibility
- **Competitive Advantage:** Real-time agent transparency is a key differentiator

### Regulatory/Compliance Impact
- **Enterprise Customers:** Audit trail requirements may be compromised
- **Observability:** Missing event data affects system monitoring and debugging
