# FAILING TEST GARDENER WORKLOG - CRITICAL TESTS

**Generated:** 2025-09-13 20:17 UTC
**Test Focus:** Critical/Mission Critical Tests
**Environment:** Windows, Local Development

## Executive Summary

Multiple critical infrastructure failures identified that prevent running mission critical test suite:

1. **CRITICAL**: Docker daemon unavailable preventing Docker-dependent tests
2. **CRITICAL**: Unit test failures causing fast-fail behavior
3. **CRITICAL**: WebSocket SSOT violations detected
4. **CRITICAL**: Mission Critical WebSocket agent events test timeouts and failures

## Detailed Issues Discovered

### Issue 1: Docker Daemon Unavailable (CRITICAL - P0)

**Type:** Infrastructure/Environment Issue
**Severity:** P0 - Blocking
**Category:** failing-test-infrastructure-critical

**Description:**
Docker daemon is not running or accessible, preventing Docker-dependent tests from executing. This blocks the entire test suite for categories that require Docker services.

**Error Details:**
```
Failed to initialize Docker client (Docker daemon may not be running):
Error while fetching server API version: (2, 'CreateFile', 'The system cannot find the file specified.')
```

**Impact:**
- Mission critical tests cannot run with full service integration
- Development workflow blocked for Docker-dependent testing
- CI/CD pipeline potentially compromised

**Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR functionality cannot be validated through comprehensive testing

---

### Issue 2: Unit Test Failures Causing Fast-Fail (CRITICAL - P1)

**Type:** Test Regression
**Severity:** P1 - High
**Category:** failing-test-regression-critical

**Description:**
Unit test execution is failing and triggering fast-fail behavior, preventing execution of mission critical tests.

**Error Details:**
```
Fast-fail triggered by category: unit
Stopping execution: SkipReason.CATEGORY_FAILED
Return code: 1
```

**Impact:**
- Mission critical tests skipped due to unit test failures
- Test execution stops before reaching critical business functionality validation

---

### Issue 3: WebSocket SSOT Violations (CRITICAL - P1)

**Type:** SSOT Architecture Violation
**Severity:** P1 - High
**Category:** failing-test-active-dev-critical-ssot-violation

**Description:**
SSOT warning detected for WebSocket Manager classes, indicating potential duplicate implementations violating Single Source of Truth principles.

**Error Details:**
```
SSOT WARNING: Found other WebSocket Manager classes: ['netra_backend.app.websocket_core.websocket_man...
```

**Impact:**
- WebSocket functionality may have competing implementations
- Potential race conditions in WebSocket event delivery
- Core chat functionality ($500K+ ARR) at risk

---

### Issue 4: Mission Critical WebSocket Events Test Issues (CRITICAL - P0)

**Type:** Mission Critical Test Failure
**Severity:** P0 - Blocking
**Category:** failing-test-regression-critical-websocket-events

**Description:**
Mission critical WebSocket agent events test suite experiencing timeouts and specific test failures around individual event structure validation.

**Error Details:**
```
tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py::TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_agent_started_event_structure FAILED
tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py::TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_agent_thinking_event_structure FAILED
tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py::TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_tool_executing_event_structure FAILED
Command timed out after 2m 0.0s
```

**Impact:**
- Core WebSocket event delivery validation failing
- Real-time chat functionality ($500K+ ARR) validation compromised
- Individual event structure validation not passing

**Additional Context:**
- Tests are connecting to staging WebSocket endpoint successfully
- Component-level tests passing but individual event validation failing
- Timeout suggests performance or hanging issues

---

## Test Execution Environment

**Test Command Used:**
```bash
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category mission_critical --no-docker --no-coverage --fast-fail
```

**Environment Details:**
- Python 3.13.7
- Windows Platform
- Docker: Not Available
- Test Files Checked: 6,095 files (syntax validation passed)

## Next Actions Required

1. **P0**: Investigate Docker daemon availability and startup
2. **P0**: Identify and fix unit test failures preventing test execution
3. **P1**: Investigate WebSocket SSOT violations and consolidate implementations
4. **P0**: Debug mission critical WebSocket events test failures and timeouts
5. **P1**: Ensure all critical business functionality can be validated without Docker dependencies

## Business Priority

This directly impacts the ability to validate $500K+ ARR functionality through the mission critical test suite. Chat functionality (90% of platform value) cannot be comprehensively tested until these issues are resolved.
