# FAILING-TEST-GARDENER-WORKLOG-agents-2025-09-14-1104.md

**Date:** 2025-09-14 11:04
**Focus:** Agent Tests (TEST-FOCUS = agents)
**Scope:** Unit, Integration (non-docker), E2E staging tests for agents
**Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR - Core chat functionality protection

## Executive Summary

Identified critical failing tests in agent functionality, particularly WebSocket agent event validation. These failures impact core chat functionality which represents 90% of platform business value ($500K+ ARR).

## Test Execution Results

### Mission Critical Test Results
**File:** `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`
**Status:** 3 FAILURES out of 39 tests
**Business Impact:** CRITICAL - WebSocket agent events are core to chat functionality

### Identified Test Issues

#### 1. WebSocket Agent Event Structure Failures (CRITICAL - P0)

**Failing Tests:**
- `TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_agent_started_event_structure`
- `TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_tool_executing_event_structure`
- `TestIndividualWebSocketEvents::test_tool_completed_event_structure`

**Error Details:**
```
test_agent_started_event_structure: agent_started event structure validation failed
test_tool_executing_event_structure: tool_executing missing tool_name
test_tool_completed_event_structure: tool_completed missing results
```

**Business Context:**
- **Revenue Impact:** $500K+ ARR at risk - chat functionality is 90% of platform value
- **User Experience:** Real-time agent progress visibility broken
- **Platform Reliability:** Core WebSocket events failing validation

**Technical Context:**
- WebSocket connections successfully established to staging: `wss://netra-backend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app/api/v1/websocket`
- Events are being sent but missing required fields
- Structure validation logic failing

#### 2. Docker Infrastructure Issues (P2)

**Error Details:**
```
Failed to build images: backend.alpine.Dockerfile:69
COPY --chown=netra:netra netra_backend /app/netra_backend
Port conflicts detected: [5432, 6379]
Docker disk space may be full
```

**Business Context:**
- **Development Impact:** Blocks local development and testing
- **CI/CD Impact:** Integration tests cannot run properly
- **Developer Velocity:** Slows down development iteration

**Technical Context:**
- Alpine Docker build failing on line 69
- PostgreSQL and Redis port conflicts
- Docker disk space issues

#### 3. Unit Test Collection/Execution Issues (P1)

**Error Pattern:**
```
Fast-fail triggered by category: unit
Overall: FAIL: FAILED
Categories Executed: 1
Category Results: unit FAIL: FAILED (217.28s)
```

**Business Context:**
- **Test Coverage:** Agent unit tests not running properly
- **Code Quality:** Cannot validate agent code changes
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Broken test execution pipeline

## Infrastructure Status

### Test Infrastructure Health
- **Unified Test Runner:** Partially functional (execution issues)
- **WebSocket Connection:** ✅ WORKING - Successfully connects to staging
- **Docker Services:** ❌ FAILED - Build and startup issues
- **Service Discovery:** ⚠️ WARNING - Port conflicts detected

### Environment Detection
```
DETECTED ENVIRONMENT: local
DEFAULT TIER: free
WEBSOCKET RECV TIMEOUT: 10s
AGENT EXECUTION TIMEOUT: 8s
CLOUD RUN DETECTED: False
```

## Resource Usage
- **Memory Usage:** 252.0 MB peak
- **Test Execution Time:** 217.28s (unit), 6.17s (integration)
- **Docker Timeout:** Multiple timeout failures during service startup

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0)
1. **Fix WebSocket Event Structure:** Ensure `agent_started`, `tool_executing`, and `tool_completed` events contain required fields
2. **Investigate Event Validation Logic:** Check `MissionCriticalEventValidator` validation rules
3. **Verify Event Generation:** Ensure agent execution properly populates event fields

### Short-term Actions (P1)
1. **Fix Unit Test Execution:** Investigate unified test runner failures for agent tests
2. **Docker Infrastructure:** Resolve Docker build and port conflict issues
3. **Test Collection:** Fix agent test discovery and collection issues

### Medium-term Actions (P2)
1. **Docker Optimization:** Improve Docker build reliability and disk space management
2. **Test Performance:** Optimize test execution times
3. **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Add better visibility into test execution issues
