# Failing Test Gardener Worklog - Critical Test Focus

**Generated:** 2025-09-14T02:55  
**Test Focus:** Critical/Mission Critical Tests  
**Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR protection  

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDINGS:**
1. **3 FAILING EVENT STRUCTURE TESTS** in mission critical WebSocket agent events suite
2. **2 COMPLETELY NON-FUNCTIONAL CRITICAL TEST FILES** with all content commented out  
3. **SIGNIFICANT TEST COLLECTION ISSUES** preventing critical test execution

**Business Risk:** Mission critical tests that protect $500K+ ARR are either failing or completely non-functional.

## Discovered Issues

### Issue 1: WebSocket Agent Event Structure Validation Failures
**File:** `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`  
**Type:** failing-test-regression-P1-websocket-event-validation-failures  
**Status:** FAILING (3/39 tests)

**Failed Tests:**
1. `test_agent_started_event_structure` - agent_started event structure validation failed
2. `test_agent_thinking_event_structure` - agent_thinking event missing reasoning content  
3. `test_tool_executing_event_structure` - tool_executing missing tool_name

**Business Impact:** Core chat functionality WebSocket events not delivering expected content structure - affects real-time user experience.

**Error Details:**
```
AssertionError: agent_started event structure validation failed
AssertionError: agent_thinking event missing reasoning content  
AssertionError: tool_executing missing tool_name
```

**Event Data Received:** Events are returning `connect` type with legacy mode data instead of expected event-specific structures.

**Priority:** P1 (High) - Core chat functionality affected

### Issue 2: Critical Test File Completely Non-Functional - Docker Stability
**File:** `tests/mission_critical/test_docker_stability_suite.py`  
**Type:** uncollectable-test-active-dev-P0-docker-critical-tests-removed  
**Status:** UNCOLLECTABLE (0 items collected)

**Problem:** Entire file content is commented out with "REMOVED_SYNTAX_ERROR" prefixes, rendering all Docker stability tests non-functional.

**Business Impact:** Docker infrastructure stability tests that protect production deployment reliability are completely disabled.

**Error Details:**
```
collected 0 items
```

**Priority:** P0 (Critical) - No Docker infrastructure validation happening

---

### Issue 3: Critical SSOT Compliance Test File Non-Functional  
**File:** `tests/mission_critical/test_no_ssot_violations.py`  
**Type:** uncollectable-test-active-dev-P0-ssot-critical-tests-removed  
**Status:** UNCOLLECTABLE (0 items collected)

**Problem:** Entire file content is commented out with "REMOVED_SYNTAX_ERROR" prefixes, disabling all SSOT compliance validation.

**Business Impact:** SSOT compliance tests that ensure system reliability and prevent architectural violations are completely disabled.

**Error Details:**
```
collected 0 items  
```

**Priority:** P0 (Critical) - No SSOT compliance validation happening

---

## Test Collection Health Summary

**Total Critical Issues Found:** 3
- **P0 Critical:** 2 issues (100% test functionality lost)
- **P1 High:** 1 issue (WebSocket event validation failures)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Immediate Risk:** Critical test coverage gaps expose system to production failures
- **Revenue Risk:** $500K+ ARR protected by these tests is at risk
- **Infrastructure Risk:** Docker and SSOT compliance not being validated

---

## Deprecation Warnings Observed

Multiple deprecation warnings found across test execution:
- `shared.logging.unified_logger_factory` deprecated  
- WebSocketManager import path deprecated
- Pydantic class-based config deprecated

**Impact:** Future breaking changes likely without migration.

---

## Next Actions Required

1. **Restore Docker stability tests** - Uncomment and fix syntax in `test_docker_stability_suite.py`
2. **Restore SSOT compliance tests** - Uncomment and fix syntax in `test_no_ssot_violations.py`  
3. **Fix WebSocket event structure validation** - Debug event structure mismatch in staging
4. **Address deprecation warnings** - Migrate deprecated imports and patterns

**Session Complete:** Ready for sub-agent processing of individual issues.
