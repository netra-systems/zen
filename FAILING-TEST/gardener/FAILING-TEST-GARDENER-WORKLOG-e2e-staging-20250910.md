# Failing Test Gardener Worklog - E2E Staging Tests

**Date:** 2025-09-10
**Test Focus:** e2e staging  
**Execution Environment:** Windows
**Status:** CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED

## Executive Summary

E2E staging test execution is completely blocked by multiple infrastructure issues. No e2e tests can run successfully due to Docker dependency failures and test timeout issues.

## Discovered Issues

### Issue #1: Docker Desktop Service Not Running (BLOCKING)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Category:** Infrastructure Dependency
**Impact:** 100% of e2e tests blocked

**Details:**
- Docker Desktop service is not running
- Error: "Docker Desktop service is not running"  
- Unified test runner detects Windows environment and uses safe runner
- Safe runner immediately fails on Docker health check
- All e2e tests have Docker dependencies and cannot execute

**Test Output:**
```
[WARNING] Windows detected with e2e tests - using safe runner to prevent Docker crash
[INFO] See tests/e2e/WINDOWS_SAFE_TESTING_GUIDE.md for details
[INFO] Executing: C:\Program Files\Python313\python.exe C:\GitHub\netra-apex\tests\e2e\run_safe_windows.py
Checking Docker health...
[ERROR] Docker Desktop service is not running

[WARNING] Docker services are not healthy!
Please ensure Docker Desktop is running and services are started:
  python scripts/docker_manual.py start
```

**Business Impact:** 
- Cannot validate Golden Path user flows ($500K+ ARR at risk)
- Cannot test WebSocket agent events (90% of platform value)
- Cannot verify staging environment functionality
- E2E regression detection completely disabled

### Issue #2: E2E Test Timeout/Hanging (BLOCKING)  
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Category:** Test Infrastructure  
**Impact:** Even when trying to bypass Docker, e2e tests hang/timeout

**Details:**
- Attempted to run `tests/e2e/critical/test_auth_jwt_critical.py`
- Test collection succeeded (6 items collected)
- Test execution hangs at first test: `test_jwt_token_generation_works`
- Timeout after 120 seconds indicates infinite loop or blocking operation
- Suggests fundamental issue with e2e test infrastructure beyond Docker

**Test Output:**
```
collecting ... collected 6 items

tests/e2e/critical/test_auth_jwt_critical.py::TestCriticalJWTAuthentication::test_jwt_token_generation_works
[TIMEOUT AFTER 120s]
```

**Business Impact:**
- Critical JWT authentication cannot be validated
- Auth service integration testing blocked
- User authentication flows unverified

### Issue #3: Windows E2E Test Infrastructure Complexity
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Category:** Platform Compatibility
**Impact:** Windows development environment has degraded e2e test support

**Details:**
- Windows-specific safe runner implementation exists but fails
- Special handling required for Windows Docker interactions
- Documentation references `tests/e2e/WINDOWS_SAFE_TESTING_GUIDE.md` 
- Suggests known Windows compatibility issues with e2e infrastructure

## Test Discovery Analysis

**Total E2E Test Files Found:** 200+ test files across multiple categories:
- Agent execution and orchestration tests
- Authentication and authorization tests  
- Database integration tests
- Frontend integration tests
- WebSocket communication tests
- Business workflow tests
- Configuration validation tests

**Current Discoverability:** 0% - No e2e tests can execute
**Expected Test Count:** ~400-500 individual test methods (estimated)

## Immediate Action Required

1. **Docker Infrastructure Fix** - Restore Docker Desktop service
2. **Test Timeout Investigation** - Identify why e2e tests hang even without Docker
3. **Windows Compatibility Audit** - Assess Windows e2e test support status
4. **Staging Environment Validation** - Cannot verify staging readiness

## GitHub Issues Created âœ…

1. **Issue #268:** [failing-test-infrastructure-critical-docker-desktop-service-not-running](https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/268)
   - **Status:** Created and linked to related issues
   - **Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocks 100% of e2e tests
   - **Cross-references:** Issues #257, #259, #265 and PRs #82, #49, #258

2. **Issue #270:** [failing-test-regression-critical-e2e-tests-timeout-hanging](https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/270)
   - **Status:** Created with investigation roadmap
   - **Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocks JWT authentication testing
   - **Cross-references:** Issues #268, #257, #259, #254

3. **Issue #274:** [uncollectable-test-active-dev-high-windows-e2e-infrastructure-degraded](https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/274)
   - **Status:** Created with comprehensive analysis
   - **Priority:** HIGH - Affects Windows developer experience
   - **Cross-references:** Issue #270, documentation, and learning specs

## Business Risk Assessment

- **Revenue Risk:** HIGH - Cannot validate $500K+ ARR dependent Golden Path flows
- **Deployment Risk:** CRITICAL - No e2e validation before staging/production deployment
- **Customer Impact:** HIGH - Cannot verify end-to-end user experience quality
- **Development Velocity:** BLOCKED - E2E regression testing completely disabled

## Resolution Status

**âœ… GARDENER WORK COMPLETED:**
- All 3 critical issues identified and tracked in GitHub
- Cross-references established between related issues
- Business impact quantified for prioritization
- Technical investigation roadmaps provided
- Proper labeling and categorization applied

**ðŸŽ¯ NEXT ACTIONS (For Development Team):**
1. Restore Docker Desktop service (#268)
2. Re-test to isolate timeout behavior (#270) 
3. Enhance Windows e2e infrastructure (#274)
4. Validate Golden Path flows after fixes
