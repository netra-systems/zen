## Security Architecture Analysis

### üèóÔ∏è Factory Pattern Security Features

#### 1. **IsolatedWebSocketManager**
```
‚úÖ Private connection dictionary (no shared state)
‚úÖ Private message queue per user
‚úÖ UserExecutionContext enforcement on all operations  
‚úÖ Connection-scoped lifecycle management
‚úÖ Isolated error handling and metrics
```

#### 2. **WebSocketManagerFactory**
```  
‚úÖ Per-connection isolation keys (strongest isolation)
‚úÖ Resource limit enforcement (max managers per user)
‚úÖ Automatic cleanup of expired managers
‚úÖ Thread-safe factory operations with RLock
‚úÖ Comprehensive security metrics and monitoring
```

#### 3. **ConnectionLifecycleManager**
```
‚úÖ Connection registration with user validation
‚úÖ Health monitoring and automatic cleanup
‚úÖ Security audit logging for violations
‚úÖ Resource leak prevention
```

### üîí User Context Isolation

The factory pattern enforces **three levels of isolation**:

1. **User-Level Isolation:** Each user gets separate manager instances
2. **Connection-Level Isolation:** Each WebSocket connection gets unique isolation key  
3. **Request-Level Isolation:** Each request maintains independent execution context

**Isolation Key Strategy:**
```
user_id:websocket_connection_id  (Connection-level - strongest)
user_id:request_id              (Request-level - fallback)
```

This ensures that even multiple connections from the same user are isolated from each other.
