# SSOT-incomplete-migration-websocket-agent-integration-blocking-golden-path

**GitHub Issue:** [#680](https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/680)  
**Priority:** P0 CRITICAL  
**Status:** ACTIVE - In Progress  
**Created:** 2025-01-13

## Business Impact Summary
- **90% of platform value blocked** (chat is core business value)
- **$500K+ ARR at immediate risk** from non-functional real-time chat
- **0% concurrent user success rate** - complete user isolation failure
- **Golden Path BLOCKED:** Users cannot login → get AI responses

## SSOT Violations Identified

### 1. Multiple WebSocketNotifier Implementations
- **CANONICAL SSOT:** `netra_backend/app/websocket_core/manager.py`
- **DUPLICATE:** Multiple scattered implementations
- **IMPACT:** Race conditions, inconsistent event delivery

### 2. Duplicate Agent Execution Patterns  
- **VIOLATION:** Factory pattern not properly implemented
- **IMPACT:** Shared state between users, 0% concurrent success
- **FILES AFFECTED:** Agent execution engine, supervisor patterns

### 3. Inconsistent WebSocket Authentication
- **VIOLATION:** Auth logic scattered across services
- **IMPACT:** HTTP 403 failures despite healthy services
- **EVIDENCE:** Issue #631 WebSocket auth integration failure

### 4. Event Delivery Inconsistencies
- **CRITICAL EVENTS NOT RELIABLE:**
  - agent_started
  - agent_thinking  
  - tool_executing
  - tool_completed
  - agent_completed

## Evidence Issues from Analysis
- **#674:** 0% success rate for multi-user concurrent functionality
- **#669:** Duplicate WebSocketNotifier implementations
- **#666:** Complete WebSocket service failure  
- **#631:** WebSocket auth integration failure
- **#633:** WebSocket startup verification corrupted

## SSOT Remediation Plan

### Phase 1: Test Discovery (Step 1)
- [ ] Discover existing WebSocket tests protecting against breaking changes
- [ ] Identify gaps in test coverage for concurrent users
- [ ] Plan failing tests to reproduce SSOT violations

### Phase 2: Test Creation (Step 2)  
- [ ] Create tests for WebSocketNotifier SSOT compliance
- [ ] Create tests for factory pattern user isolation
- [ ] Create tests for 5 critical WebSocket events delivery
- [ ] Create tests for concurrent user success rate

### Phase 3: SSOT Remediation (Steps 3-4)
- [ ] Eliminate duplicate WebSocketNotifier implementations
- [ ] Fix factory pattern violations for user isolation
- [ ] Centralize WebSocket authentication
- [ ] Ensure reliable delivery of all 5 critical events

### Phase 4: Test Fix Loop (Step 5)
- [ ] Run and fix all tests until 100% pass
- [ ] Verify 100% concurrent user success rate
- [ ] Verify Golden Path functionality restored

### Phase 5: PR and Closure (Step 6)
- [ ] Create PR when all tests pass
- [ ] Cross-link to close issue #680

## Success Criteria
- [ ] **100% concurrent user success rate** (currently 0%)
- [ ] **All 5 WebSocket events delivered reliably**
- [ ] **Single WebSocketNotifier SSOT implementation**
- [ ] **Factory pattern compliance verified**
- [ ] **Golden Path working:** Users login → get AI responses

## Testing Strategy
- **Mission Critical Tests:** `python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`
- **Integration Tests:** Non-docker WebSocket integration tests
- **E2E Tests:** GCP staging environment validation
- **NO DOCKER TESTS:** Focus on unit, integration (no docker), staging e2e

## Work Log

### 2025-01-13 - Issue Created
- Analyzed last 20 git issues and identified WebSocket/Agent integration as #1 most critical SSOT violation
- Created GitHub issue #680 with P0 CRITICAL priority
- Impact: $500K+ ARR at risk, 90% platform value blocked
- Evidence: 0% concurrent user success rate from issue #674

### Next Steps
- Begin Step 1: Discover and plan tests for SSOT violations
- Focus on existing WebSocket tests and identify coverage gaps
- Plan failing tests to reproduce current SSOT violations
