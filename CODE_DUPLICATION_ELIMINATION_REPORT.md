## Implementation Guide

### Using Unified JWT Validator
```python
from app.core.unified.jwt_validator import jwt_validator, TokenType

# Create tokens
access_token = jwt_validator.create_access_token(
    user_id="user123", 
    email="user@netra.ai", 
    permissions=["read", "write"]
)

# Validate tokens
result = jwt_validator.validate_token(access_token, TokenType.ACCESS)
if result.valid:
    print(f"User: {result.user_id}, Email: {result.email}")
else:
    print(f"Invalid token: {result.error} ({result.error_code})")
```

### Using Unified Database Manager
```python
from app.core.unified.db_connection_manager import db_manager

# Register databases
db_manager.register_postgresql("main", DATABASE_URL)
db_manager.register_sqlite("test", "sqlite:///test.db")

# Use async sessions
async with db_manager.get_async_session("main") as session:
    users = await session.execute(select(User))
    
# Monitor health
health = db_manager.get_health_status()
metrics = db_manager.get_connection_metrics("main")
```

### Using Unified Retry Decorator
```python
from app.core.unified.retry_decorator import unified_retry, database_retry, api_retry

# Custom retry configuration
@unified_retry(
    max_attempts=5,
    strategy=RetryStrategy.EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF,
    circuit_breaker=True
)
async def external_api_call():
    # Function that might fail
    pass

# Pre-configured decorators
@database_retry
async def db_operation():
    # Database function with appropriate settings
    pass

@api_retry
async def api_request():
    # API call with retry logic
    pass
```
