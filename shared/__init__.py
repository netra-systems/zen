"""Shared utilities and libraries for Netra services.

This package contains shared utilities that can be imported by any service
without violating service independence principles. These are pure utilities
with no business logic - think of them as internal pip packages.

See docs/shared_library_pattern.md for the "pip package test" to determine
what belongs in this shared package.
