## 2. Infrastructure Team Action Items

### 2.1 CRITICAL - VPC Connector Issues
**Component**: `staging-connector`  
**Issue**: VPC connectivity failures preventing database and Redis access

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] **Validate VPC connector health**: Check connector status and capacity
- [ ] **Review connection limits**: Verify not exceeding 50+ concurrent connection threshold
- [ ] **Check egress configuration**: Ensure all-traffic egress properly configured
- [ ] **Validate routing**: Confirm traffic routing between Cloud Run and Cloud SQL

**Evidence of Issue**:
```
Error patterns:
- Redis VPC connectivity issue: "error -3" with IP 10.166.204.83
- Database timeout errors during SMD Phase 3
- WebSocket connection rejections (HTTP 500/503)
```

### 2.2 CRITICAL - Cloud SQL Connectivity
**Component**: `netra-staging:us-central1:staging-shared-postgres`  
**Issue**: Database connectivity timeouts and connection pool exhaustion

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] **Instance status validation**: Check Cloud SQL instance health
- [ ] **Connection pool review**: Verify pool configuration (current: 10 pool, 15 overflow)
- [ ] **Resource utilization**: Check CPU, memory, I/O constraints
- [ ] **Network connectivity**: Validate socket connections to `/cloudsql/.../.s.PGSQL.5432`

**Evidence of Issue**:
```
Timeout Configuration (Already Fixed in Code):
- Database timeout: 600s (Issue #1263 resolution)
- Pool configuration: Properly configured per SSOT patterns
- Application code: All validated as correct
```

### 2.3 CRITICAL - Load Balancer Configuration
**Component**: GCP Load Balancer for staging domains  
**Issue**: SSL certificate and health check configuration problems

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] **SSL certificate validation**: Confirm *.netrasystems.ai certificates deployed
- [ ] **Health check configuration**: Verify extended startup times (600s requirement)
- [ ] **Backend service routing**: Ensure proper routing to Cloud Run services
- [ ] **Timeout alignment**: Validate request timeouts align with database fixes

**Evidence of Issue**:
```
Domain Configuration Issues:
- Correct domains: *.netrasystems.ai
- Deprecated domains: *.staging.netrasystems.ai (causes SSL failures)
- Load balancer must route to correct Cloud Run services
```

### 2.4 CRITICAL - Cloud Run Service Configuration
**Component**: Backend and Auth Cloud Run services  
**Issue**: Service deployment and resource allocation problems

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] **Service deployment status**: Verify services deployed and healthy
- [ ] **Resource allocation**: Check memory/CPU limits for startup sequence
- [ ] **Service account permissions**: Validate IAM roles for Cloud SQL access
- [ ] **Environment variables**: Confirm staging environment variables configured

## 3. Monitoring and Validation

### 3.1 Infrastructure Restoration Indicators
**Primary Tests** (Run these to confirm fixes):
```bash
# Basic connectivity test
curl -f https://staging.netrasystems.ai/health

# Infrastructure-specific health
curl -f https://staging.netrasystems.ai/health/infrastructure

# WebSocket connectivity
curl -f https://api-staging.netrasystems.ai/health
```

**Success Criteria**:
- All endpoints return HTTP 200
- Infrastructure health shows "healthy" status
- No VPC connectivity errors in logs
- Database connections complete within timeout

### 3.2 Validation Workflow
**After Infrastructure Fixes**:
1. **Run monitoring script**: Verify all endpoints healthy
2. **Check infrastructure endpoint**: Confirm components restored
3. **Run validation script**: Execute comprehensive post-fix validation
4. **Execute specific tests**: Run Issue #1278 test suite

```bash
# Step-by-step validation
python scripts/monitor_infrastructure_health.py
python scripts/validate_infrastructure_fix.py
python -m pytest tests/e2e/ -k "issue_1278" -v -m staging
```
