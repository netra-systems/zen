# SSOT Issue: Fragmented Test Configuration

**Issue Type**: SSOT-incomplete-migration-fragmented-test-configuration
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: In Progress

## Problem Statement

Critical SSOT violation in test infrastructure: 22+ separate `conftest.py` files across services creating fragmented test configuration instead of using unified SSOT patterns.

## Evidence

### Current State (Violations)
1. **Main test configuration** - `/tests/conftest.py`:
   - Lines 58-88: Imports multiple fixture modules instead of SSOT patterns
   - Creates fragmented test environment setup

2. **Service-specific configurations**:
   - `/netra_backend/tests/conftest.py` - Independent backend test config
   - `/auth_service/tests/conftest.py` - Separate auth service config  
   - `/frontend/tests/conftest.py` - Independent frontend test setup
   - 18+ additional conftest.py files across subdirectories

3. **Impact on Golden Path**:
   - Inconsistent test environments block reliable agent testing
   - Mock behavior varies between services
   - WebSocket event testing unreliable due to fixture conflicts

## Business Impact

- **Primary**: Prevents reliable testing of chat functionality (90% of platform value)
- **Secondary**: Creates debugging loops due to inconsistent test behavior
- **Risk**: $500K+ ARR at risk if chat functionality fails in production
