# Dev Launcher Audit Report
## Date: 2025-08-24

## Summary
The dev launcher successfully starts all core services (Backend, Auth, Frontend) but has several issues that need attention.

## Services Status

### ✅ Working Services
1. **Backend API** (Port 8000)
   - Health endpoint: ✅ Responding correctly
   - Status: Healthy
   - Database connections: Mostly working

2. **Auth Service** (Port 8081)
   - Health endpoint: ✅ Responding correctly  
   - Status: Healthy
   - Uptime tracking: Working

3. **Frontend** (Port 3000)
   - HTTP responses: ✅ Working
   - CSP headers: Properly configured
   - Next.js: Running with Turbopack

4. **Redis** (Port 6379)
   - Connection: ✅ Successful
   - Using Docker container

5. **PostgreSQL** (Port 5433)
   - Connection: ✅ Successful
   - Migrations: Partially working (tables exist warning)

## ❌ Issues Found

### Critical Issues

1. **ClickHouse Authentication Failure**
   - Error: Authentication failed with password incorrect
   - Impact: ClickHouse features unavailable
   - Root cause: Password mismatch between application and ClickHouse container

2. **WebSocket Authentication Issues**
   - Main WebSocket endpoint (/ws) requires authentication
   - MCP WebSocket endpoint (/api/mcp/ws) also failing
   - Impact: Real-time features not working without proper auth tokens

### Non-Critical Issues

1. **Database Migration Warnings**
   - Tables already exist when running migrations
   - Suggests database state mismatch with migration history

2. **Async/Await Warnings**
   - Several coroutine warnings in dev launcher
   - RuntimeWarning about unawaited coroutines in startup checks

3. **Frontend Proxy Error**
   - Failed to proxy to port 8004 (ECONNREFUSED)
   - This appears to be for an optional service

4. **Deprecated Warnings**
   - Auth client shim deprecation warnings
   - WebSocket handler deprecation warning
   - Node.js deprecation warning about shell arguments

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix ClickHouse authentication**
   - Update ClickHouse password in Docker container or application config
   - Verify CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD environment variable

2. **Update WebSocket test authentication**
   - WebSocket connections require proper auth tokens
   - This is working as designed for security

### Medium Priority
1. **Fix async/await issues in dev launcher**
   - Update dev launcher to properly await async operations
   - Fix backend/auth/frontend readiness checks

2. **Clean up database migrations**
   - Consider resetting migration history
   - Or add proper checks for existing tables

### Low Priority
1. **Update deprecated code**
   - Migrate from auth client shim to auth_client_core
   - Update WebSocket handler signature
   - Fix Node.js shell command arguments

## Conclusion
The development environment is functional for basic development work. All core services start and respond to health checks. The main issues are with ClickHouse authentication and some async handling in the launcher itself. WebSocket authentication is working as designed for security.
