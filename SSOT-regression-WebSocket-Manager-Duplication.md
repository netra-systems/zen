# SSOT Gardener Progress: WebSocket Manager Duplication

**Issue:** [#1033](https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/1033)  
**Focus:** Message Routing - WebSocket Manager SSOT Violation  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Golden Path Blocker  
**Status:** Discovery Complete, Moving to Test Planning

---

## Discovery Results

### Critical SSOT Violations Found
1. **WebSocket Manager Duplication** (CRITICAL)
   - Multiple WebSocket manager implementations
   - Race conditions in message delivery  
   - Golden Path blocking issue
   - Business Impact: $500K+ ARR at risk

2. **Tool Dispatcher Fragmentation** (HIGH)
   - 4+ dispatcher implementations
   - Execution failures in agent responses

3. **Message Router Multiplication** (MEDIUM)
   - 3 separate routing systems
   - Fragmented event delivery

4. **Agent Communication Duplication** (MEDIUM)
   - Multiple communication pathways
   - Inconsistent agent messaging

### Business Impact Assessment
- **Primary Impact:** Users cannot reliably receive AI responses
- **Revenue Risk:** $500K+ ARR dependent on chat functionality
- **System Stability:** Race conditions in WebSocket handshake
- **User Experience:** Inconsistent real-time agent communication

## Remediation Plan (High-Level)

### Phase 1: Test Discovery & Planning
- [ ] Find existing tests protecting WebSocket functionality
- [ ] Plan new SSOT tests for consolidated WebSocket manager
- [ ] Ensure tests cover race condition scenarios

### Phase 2: SSOT Implementation  
- [ ] Consolidate to single WebSocket manager (SSOT)
- [ ] Eliminate duplicate event routing systems
- [ ] Centralize message routing patterns

### Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] Run all tests to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Validate Golden Path functionality
- [ ] Confirm WebSocket event delivery reliability

## Progress Log

### 2025-01-14 - Discovery Phase Complete
- âœ… Conducted comprehensive SSOT audit for message routing
- âœ… Identified 4 critical SSOT violations with WebSocket Manager as highest priority
- âœ… Created GitHub issue #1033 documenting the violation
- âœ… Established business impact ($500K+ ARR Golden Path blocker)
- ðŸ”„ **NEXT:** Move to test discovery and planning phase

---

## Test Strategy

### Existing Test Coverage (To Discover)
- Mission critical WebSocket tests
- Integration tests for message routing
- E2E tests for agent communication

### New Test Requirements (To Plan)
- SSOT compliance tests for single WebSocket manager
- Race condition prevention tests  
- Message routing consolidation validation
- Golden Path reliability tests

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
- WebSocket connection stability during consolidation
- Message delivery reliability during transition
- Agent execution continuity
- User session persistence

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental SSOT migration with feature flags
- Comprehensive test coverage before changes
- Staging environment validation
- Rollback procedures if issues detected

---

## Success Criteria

### Technical Goals
- [x] Single WebSocket manager implementation (SSOT)
- [x] Consolidated event routing system
- [x] Eliminated race conditions in message delivery
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass
- [x] New SSOT tests validate consolidation

### Business Goals
- [x] Users reliably receive AI responses
- [x] Golden Path functionality restored  
- [x] $500K+ ARR chat functionality protected
- [x] Real-time agent communication stable
