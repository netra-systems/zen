## 1. BASELINE PERFORMANCE METRICS

### 1.1 Core Performance Indicators

**Primary Metrics (Must Monitor):**
```yaml
Latency Metrics:
  - State persistence operation latency (P50, P90, P95, P99)
  - Cache lookup latency
  - Hash calculation time
  - Database write operation latency
  
Throughput Metrics:
  - Operations per second (state saves)
  - Concurrent operation capacity
  - Cache operations per second
  - Deduplication rate percentage

Resource Utilization:
  - Memory usage (baseline and peak)
  - CPU utilization during operations
  - Database connection pool utilization
  - Network I/O for database operations

Business Metrics:

  - Cache hit ratio effectiveness
```

### 1.2 Baseline Measurement Methodology

**Test Environment Setup:**
```yaml
Infrastructure:
  - Dedicated test environment matching production specs
  - Isolated database instance with known baseline performance
  - Consistent network conditions
  - No other significant load during testing

Data Preparation:
  - 10,000 representative state objects (varying sizes)
  - Realistic user ID and thread ID distributions  
  - Mix of duplicate and unique state data (60/40 split)
  - Representative checkpoint type distribution
```

**Measurement Process:**
1. **Pre-Test Calibration**
   - Clean database state
   - Empty cache conditions
   - Warm-up runs to establish JIT compilation baseline
   - System resource baseline measurement

2. **Baseline Collection (Standard Service)**
   - 1000 operations with standard StatePersistenceService
   - Record all primary metrics listed above
   - Multiple runs to account for variance
   - Statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation)

3. **Optimized Service Testing**
   - Same test data and conditions
   - 1000 operations with OptimizedStatePersistence
   - Parallel baseline collection for comparison
   - Cache warming vs cold cache scenarios
