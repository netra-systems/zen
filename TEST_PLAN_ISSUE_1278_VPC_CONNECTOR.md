# ðŸš¨ TEST PLAN: Issue #1278 VPC Connector Infrastructure Failure

**Date:** 2025-09-16
**Priority:** P0 EMERGENCY
**Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR - Complete Golden Path failure
**Issue Status:** Infrastructure connectivity failure preventing Cloud Run â†’ Cloud SQL/Redis access

## Executive Summary

This test plan provides comprehensive test coverage to reproduce and validate fixes for Issue #1278 VPC connector capacity constraints that cause staging infrastructure outages. Tests are designed to **FAIL INITIALLY** to prove the issue exists, then **PASS AFTER FIXES** to validate resolution.

**Root Cause:** VPC Connector `staging-connector` capacity constraints preventing Cloud Run services from accessing Cloud SQL/Redis, causing 503 errors and golden path failure.

## Test Categories & Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests (No Docker Required)
**Purpose:** Test VPC connector monitoring and timeout logic
**Environment:** Local development
**Infrastructure:** None required
**Expected Duration:** 5-10 minutes

### 2. Integration Tests (Non-Docker)
**Purpose:** Test infrastructure connectivity patterns without Docker
**Environment:** Local with remote staging GCP resources
**Infrastructure:** Real GCP staging services
**Expected Duration:** 15-30 minutes

### 3. E2E Staging GCP Tests
**Purpose:** Test complete infrastructure connectivity in real staging environment
**Environment:** GCP staging deployment
**Infrastructure:** Full staging stack
**Expected Duration:** 30-60 minutes

## Test Execution Strategy

### Test Execution Order

1. **Unit Tests First** (5-10 minutes)
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/unit/infrastructure/ -v --tb=short
   ```

2. **Integration Tests** (15-30 minutes)
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/integration/infrastructure/ -v -m "staging_gcp" --tb=short
   ```

3. **E2E Staging Tests** (30-60 minutes)
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/ -v -m "staging_gcp" --tb=short
   ```

### Expected Failure Patterns (Before Fixes)

#### Initial Test Results - Proving Issue Exists
- **VPC Connector Capacity:** Tests timeout after 15+ concurrent connections
- **Database Connectivity:** Connections fail or timeout before 600s limit
- **Service Startup:** Phases 5-6 skipped, services return 503
- **SSL Validation:** Certificate validation degrades under VPC pressure
- **Golden Path:** Complete user journey fails with infrastructure errors

#### Success Criteria (After Fixes Applied)
- **VPC Connector Scaling:** Handles 20+ concurrent connections reliably
- **Database Timeout Compliance:** All connections complete within 600s
- **Startup Sequence:** All 7 phases complete successfully
- **SSL Certificate Performance:** Validation remains fast under load
- **Golden Path Success:** Complete user journey works end-to-end

### Test Environment Configuration

#### Staging GCP Test Configuration
```yaml
environment: staging
gcp_project: netra-staging
vpc_connector: staging-connector
domains:
  frontend: staging.netrasystems.ai
  backend: staging.netrasystems.ai
  websocket: api-staging.netrasystems.ai
database_timeout: 600s
redis_timeout: 30s
ssl_validation_timeout: 10s
```

#### Test Infrastructure Requirements
- **GCP Access:** Service account with staging environment access
- **Network Access:** Ability to reach staging.netrasystems.ai domains
- **Monitoring Access:** GCP logging and monitoring for validation
- **SSL Testing:** Certificate validation capabilities

## Validation Metrics

### Infrastructure Performance Benchmarks
- **VPC Connector Throughput:** >300 Mbps sustained
- **Database Connection Time:** <10s average, <600s maximum
- **Redis Connection Time:** <5s average, <30s maximum
- **SSL Validation Time:** <3s average, <10s maximum
- **Service Startup Time:** <60s total for all 7 phases

### Business Impact Metrics
- **Service Availability:** >99.5% uptime in staging
- **Golden Path Success Rate:** >95% end-to-end completion
- **User Experience:** <2s WebSocket connection time
- **Error Rate:** <1% infrastructure-related failures

## Test Reporting and Monitoring

### Test Result Analysis
1. **Failure Reproduction Validation:** Confirm tests fail initially as expected
2. **Fix Validation:** Tests pass after infrastructure improvements
3. **Performance Regression:** Monitor for performance degradation over time
4. **Business Impact Tracking:** Measure impact on user experience metrics

### Continuous Monitoring Integration
- **Test Suite Integration:** Add to CI/CD pipeline as infrastructure validation
- **Staging Environment Health:** Regular execution to detect capacity issues
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Track performance trends over time
- **Alert Integration:** Automated alerting when tests detect infrastructure issues
