## Issue Body

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE - P0 EMERGENCY

**IMMEDIATE BUSINESS IMPACT:** $500K+ ARR at risk due to complete agent execution system failure

### Executive Summary

The Netra Apex platform is experiencing a **complete agent execution system failure** with **0% success rate across all end-to-end tests**. This represents a catastrophic breakdown of the core platform functionality that delivers 90% of our business value.

### Critical Findings

- **0% Success Rate:** 0/17 agent requests successful across all test scenarios
- **Zero WebSocket Event Delivery:** 0/17 users receiving required WebSocket events
- **Complete Concurrency Failure:** 0/4 concurrent execution scenarios passing
- **Resource Limit Violations:** All scenarios failing resource limit validation
- **Immediate Test Failures:** All tests completing in 0.00s indicating instant failures

### Business Impact Assessment

#### Revenue at Risk
- **Primary Revenue Channel:** Chat functionality represents 90% of platform value
- **Customer Impact:** Complete inability to deliver AI-powered responses
- **ARR Exposure:** $500K+ annual recurring revenue at immediate risk
- **Golden Path Broken:** Core user journey (login â†’ get AI responses) non-functional

#### Customer Experience Impact
- Users cannot receive AI responses
- No real-time agent progress visibility
- Complete breakdown of substantive AI value delivery
- Platform effectively unusable for primary use case

### Technical Failure Analysis

#### Test Scenario Failures
From performance concurrency E2E report (2025-09-13T18:55:39):

**Scenario 1: basic_agent_performance**
- Concurrent users: 1
- Success rate: 0.0% (0/1)
- Duration: 0.00s (immediate failure)
- WebSocket events delivered: 0/1 users

**Scenario 2: supply_research_load**
- Concurrent users: 3
- Success rate: 0.0% (0/3)
- Duration: 0.00s (immediate failure)
- WebSocket events delivered: 0/3 users

**Scenario 3: domain_expert_concurrency**
- Concurrent users: 5
- Success rate: 0.0% (0/5)
- Duration: 0.00s (immediate failure)
- WebSocket events delivered: 0/5 users

**Scenario 4: high_concurrency_stress**
- Concurrent users: 8
- Success rate: 0.0% (0/8)
- Duration: 0.00s (immediate failure)
- WebSocket events delivered: 0/8 users

#### System Component Failures

**Agent Execution Pipeline**
- Complete execution pipeline breakdown
- No agent responses being generated
- All concurrent execution scenarios failing

**WebSocket Event System**
- Zero event delivery across all tests
- Required events not being sent: agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, tool_completed, agent_completed
- Real-time user feedback completely non-functional

**Resource Management**
- Resource limits not being respected in ANY scenario
- Concurrent execution not achieved in ANY scenario
- Infrastructure component failures across the board

**Infrastructure Components**
- Agent orchestration system failure
- WebSocket connection management failure
- Resource allocation and monitoring failure

### Affected Components

#### Core Infrastructure
- `/netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor_agent_modern.py`
- `/netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/execution_engine.py`
- `/netra_backend/app/websocket_core/manager.py`
- `/netra_backend/app/agents/registry.py`
- `/netra_backend/app/tools/enhanced_dispatcher.py`

#### WebSocket Event System
- `/netra_backend/app/websocket_core/manager.py`
- `/netra_backend/app/routes/websocket.py`
- WebSocket event notification system
- Real-time progress reporting

#### Agent Factory System
- User isolation and factory pattern implementation
- Concurrent execution management
- Resource allocation and monitoring

### Reproduction Steps

1. Run agent performance and concurrency tests:
   ```bash
   python tests/e2e/test_agent_performance_concurrency.py
   ```

2. Observe complete failure across all scenarios:
   - All tests complete in 0.00s
   - 0% success rate
   - No WebSocket events delivered
   - Resource limit violations

3. Check test output report:
   ```bash
   cat test_outputs/performance_concurrency_e2e_report.txt
   ```

### Expected vs Actual Behavior

#### Expected Behavior
- Agent execution pipeline processes requests successfully
- Users receive real-time WebSocket events (agent_started, agent_thinking, etc.)
- Concurrent users can execute agents simultaneously
- Resource limits are respected and enforced
- Success rates should be 90%+ for standard scenarios

#### Actual Behavior
- **0% success rate** across ALL scenarios
- **Zero WebSocket events** delivered to any users
- **Instant failures** (0.00s duration) indicating immediate system breakdown
- **Complete concurrency failure** - no concurrent execution achieved
- **Resource limit violations** in every scenario

### Critical Action Items

#### Immediate (24 hours)
- [ ] **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate agent execution pipeline failure
- [ ] **WebSocket System Investigation:** Determine why zero events are being delivered
- [ ] **Infrastructure Assessment:** Identify infrastructure component failures
- [ ] **Resource Management Review:** Fix resource limit enforcement
- [ ] **Emergency Hotfix:** Restore basic agent execution functionality

#### Short-term (48-72 hours)
- [ ] **Concurrent Execution Repair:** Fix factory pattern implementation
- [ ] **Event System Restoration:** Ensure all required WebSocket events are sent
- [ ] **Performance Validation:** Achieve 90%+ success rates in test scenarios
- [ ] **Resource Limit Compliance:** Implement proper resource management
- [ ] **Golden Path Verification:** Confirm complete user journey works

#### Medium-term (1 week)
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing:** Full E2E validation with real services
- [ ] **Monitoring Implementation:** Real-time system health monitoring
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking:** Establish success rate SLOs
- [ ] **Failsafe Implementation:** Graceful degradation strategies

### Business Value Justification

#### Segment Impact
- **All Customer Tiers:** Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise all affected
- **Primary Revenue Driver:** Chat functionality completely non-functional
- **Customer Retention Risk:** Existing customers cannot use core platform features

#### Strategic Impact
- **Product-Market Fit:** Core value proposition compromised
- **Customer Trust:** Platform reliability severely damaged
- **Competitive Position:** Major competitive disadvantage during system outage

#### Revenue Impact
- **Immediate Loss:** Unable to deliver core AI-powered value
- **Churn Risk:** Customers may seek alternative solutions
- **Growth Impact:** New customer acquisition impossible with broken core functionality

### Priority Justification

This issue is classified as **P0 CRITICAL** because:

1. **Complete System Failure:** 0% success rate represents total breakdown
2. **Revenue at Risk:** $500K+ ARR immediately threatened
3. **Core Functionality:** Affects 90% of platform business value
4. **Customer Impact:** Platform essentially unusable for primary use case
5. **Immediate Action Required:** System must be restored within 24 hours

### Investigation Leads

#### Primary Areas of Focus
1. **Agent Execution Pipeline:** Why are all agent requests failing instantly?
2. **WebSocket Event System:** Why are zero events being delivered?
3. **Infrastructure Components:** Which core components have failed?
4. **Resource Management:** Why are limits not being enforced?
5. **Factory Pattern Implementation:** Is user isolation causing execution failures?

#### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Run comprehensive agent execution tests
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py

# Check WebSocket system health
python tests/integration/critical_paths/test_websocket_silent_failures.py

# Validate SSOT compliance
python tests/mission_critical/test_ssot_compliance_suite.py

# Agent factory validation
python tests/mission_critical/test_singleton_removal_phase2.py
```

---

**ESCALATION:** This issue requires immediate engineering attention and should be addressed before any other development work. The platform is effectively non-functional for users.

**MONITORING:** Issue should be updated every 4 hours with progress until resolved.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** Agent execution success rate returns to 90%+ and all WebSocket events are properly delivered to users.
