### **Emergency Rollback Procedures**
**Deliverable:** [rollback_procedures.md](scripts/ssot_remediation/rollback_procedures.md)

**Three-Tier Rollback Strategy:**
1. **Single Commit Rollback** (< 5 minutes) - Most common, minimal impact
2. **Phase Rollback** (< 15 minutes) - Moderate impact, systematic issues
3. **Emergency System Restore** (< 30 minutes) - High impact, production protection

**Automated Safety Gates:**
- **Pre-commit validation** prevents regressions
- **Continuous monitoring** detects issues early
- **Emergency triggers** ensure rapid response
