## 🚨 Remaining Security Work Items

### ⚠️ **Input Sanitization Enhancement Needed**
- **Status:** 6/7 tests failing - requires additional input validation layers
- **Impact:** Medium - affects input processing robustness
- **Priority:** P2 - Enhanced protection for edge cases

### ⚠️ **Multi-User Isolation Edge Cases**
- **Status:** 4/5 tests failing - advanced isolation scenarios
- **Impact:** Medium - affects concurrent user scenarios
- **Priority:** P2 - Enhanced isolation for high-concurrency environments

**Note:** The critical enterprise compliance vulnerabilities are **RESOLVED**. Remaining failures are enhanced protection scenarios that do not affect the core security fixes delivered in Issue #1017.
