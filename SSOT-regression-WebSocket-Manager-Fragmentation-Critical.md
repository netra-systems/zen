# SSOT-regression-WebSocket-Manager-Fragmentation-Critical

**GitHub Issue**: [#608](https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/608)  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical/Blocking)  
**Status**: Investigation Phase  
**Golden Path Impact**: Users cannot receive AI responses - WebSocket event delivery failures

## Problem Summary

Multiple WebSocket Manager implementations (120+ classes) create race conditions preventing reliable AI response delivery in the Golden Path user flow.

## Evidence of SSOT Violations

### WebSocket Manager Proliferation
- **120+ WebSocket manager classes** found across codebase
- Compatibility layer confusion in `/netra_backend/app/websocket_core/manager.py`
- Import fragmentation across 15+ different paths
- Race condition risk with multiple manager instances

### Critical Files Identified
- `/netra_backend/app/websocket_core/manager.py` (compatibility wrapper)
- `/netra_backend/app/websocket_core/websocket_manager.py` (supposed SSOT) 
- `/netra_backend/app/websocket_core/unified_manager.py` (actual implementation)
- 120+ test/mock files creating competing implementations

### Golden Path Impact
When users attempt to chat with AI agents, WebSocket events may fail:
- `agent_started` - User doesn't see agent began processing  
- `agent_thinking` - No real-time reasoning visibility
- `tool_executing` - Tool usage not shown
- `tool_completed` - Tool results not displayed
- `agent_completed` - User doesn't know response is ready

Result: Users see no AI responses or incomplete/delayed responses.

## Work Progress Tracking

### Phase 0: Discovery ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] SSOT audit completed - identified P0 violation
- [x] GitHub issue created: #608
- [x] Local tracking file created
- [x] Priority: P0 established

### Phase 1: Test Discovery & Planning ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Find existing tests protecting WebSocket functionality
- [ ] Plan new SSOT tests to validate unified WebSocket management
- [ ] Identify test gaps in current WebSocket coverage
- [ ] Plan tests to reproduce SSOT violation (failing tests)

### Phase 2: Test Creation ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Create new SSOT tests (20% of work)
- [ ] Validate existing tests still work
- [ ] Run unit/integration tests (non-Docker)

### Phase 3: SSOT Remediation Planning ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Plan consolidation of 120+ WebSocket managers to single SSOT
- [ ] Design migration path from fragmented to unified system
- [ ] Plan compatibility preservation during transition

### Phase 4: SSOT Remediation Execution ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Implement unified WebSocket manager SSOT
- [ ] Migrate all imports to single source
- [ ] Remove duplicate implementations
- [ ] Update compatibility layer

### Phase 5: Test Validation Loop ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Run all existing WebSocket tests
- [ ] Validate Golden Path user flow works
- [ ] Fix any test failures (up to 10 cycles)
- [ ] Ensure system stability maintained

### Phase 6: PR & Closure ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Create pull request (only if tests passing)
- [ ] Cross-link to close issue #608
- [ ] Validate Golden Path restoration

## Current Status: Investigation Phase
Starting with test discovery and planning to understand impact scope before remediation.
