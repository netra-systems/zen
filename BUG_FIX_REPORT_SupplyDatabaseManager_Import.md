# Bug Fix Report: SupplyDatabaseManager Import Error

## Issue Summary
**Priority:** P1 - Critical
**Error:** `cannot import name 'SupplyDatabaseManager' from 'netra_backend.app.db.database_manager'`
**Impact:** Application crash or feature failure preventing supply_researcher agent from loading

## Five Whys Analysis

### Why #1: Why is the import failing?
The application cannot find `SupplyDatabaseManager` in the `netra_backend.app.db.database_manager` module.

### Why #2: Why can't it find SupplyDatabaseManager?
**CONFIRMED:** The `SupplyDatabaseManager` class does NOT exist in `database_manager.py`. Only `DatabaseManager` class is defined.

### Why #3: Why is this class missing/inaccessible?
The class was never implemented. The code is trying to import a non-existent specialized manager for supply operations.

### Why #4: Why wasn't this caught by existing tests?
The supply_researcher agent likely wasn't being tested with proper imports, or tests were mocked without verifying actual imports.

### Why #5: Why did this pass deployment checks?
Import errors at module level only surface when the module is actually imported at runtime, not during static deployment.

## Investigation Status
- [x] Located SupplyDatabaseManager definition - **DOES NOT EXIST**
- [x] Identified all import paths - Found in `agent.py` line 26 and `__init__.py` line 11
- [x] Found root cause - **Missing class implementation**
- [ ] Created reproducing test
- [ ] Implemented fix
- [ ] Verified across all environments

### Ideal State (WORKING)

```

## Root Cause
The `SupplyDatabaseManager` class is referenced but never implemented. The code expects a specialized database manager for supply operations that doesn't exist.
