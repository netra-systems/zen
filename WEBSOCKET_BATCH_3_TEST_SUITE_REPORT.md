## Test Execution Results

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Sample successful unit test execution
pytest netra_backend/tests/unit/websocket_core/test_websocket_notifier_unit.py::TestWebSocketNotifierCore::test_creates_agent_started_message_correctly -v
# PASSED ✅

pytest netra_backend/tests/unit/websocket_core/test_websocket_connection_management_unit.py::TestWebSocketMessageHandling::test_chat_message_serialization -v  
# PASSED ✅
```

### Integration Tests
