# WebSocket Authentication Master Plan - Issue #1292 Resolution

**Date:** 2025-01-16
**Status:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**Business Priority:** CRITICAL - Protects $500K+ ARR chat functionality
**Scope:** Resolve WebSocket authentication architectural debt through industry-standard ticket-based solution

## Executive Summary

Issue #1292 represents critical architectural debt caused by attempting to force HTTP authentication patterns onto WebSocket protocol limitations. The accumulation of 6 competing authentication pathways has created a tangled system that requires fundamental architectural remediation.

**Core Problem:** Browser WebSocket protocol prevents Authorization headers during upgrade, requiring a different authentication approach than traditional HTTP APIs.

**Solution:** Implement industry-standard ticket-based authentication that works within WebSocket protocol constraints.

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause: Protocol Mismatch
- **Browser Limitation:** WebSocket upgrade requests cannot include Authorization headers (RFC 6455 compliance)
- **Attempted Workarounds:** 6 different authentication pathways created, each adding complexity:
  1. Authorization Header (doesn't work in browsers)
  2. WebSocket Subprotocols (workaround #1)
  3. Query Parameters (workaround #2)
  4. Cookie Authentication (workaround #3)
  5. Session-based Auth (workaround #4)
  6. E2E Bypass Mode (testing workaround)

### Current State Assessment
- **Code Complexity:** 6 authentication pathways across multiple services
- **Silent Failures:** Authentication errors not properly logged (15-20% failure rate)
- **SSOT Violations:** JWT validation duplicated in backend and auth service
- **Race Conditions:** GCP Cloud Run handshake timing issues
- **Documentation Gap:** No canonical flow diagrams explaining complete authentication

### Business Impact
- **Revenue Risk:** $500K+ ARR depends on reliable WebSocket chat functionality
- **User Experience:** Silent authentication failures create confusion
- **Development Velocity:** Multiple pathways slow feature development and debugging
- **Technical Debt:** Accumulating workarounds increase maintenance burden

## Solution Architecture

### Ticket-Based Authentication Flow

    participant C as Client
    participant FE as Frontend
    participant BE as Backend/LB
    participant AS as Auth Service
    participant WS as WebSocket Handler

    Note over C,WS: Phase 1: Authentication Ticket Generation
    C->>FE: Login with credentials
    FE->>AS: POST /auth/login (HTTP)
    AS->>AS: Validate credentials
    AS->>FE: Return JWT token
    FE->>BE: POST /websocket/ticket (HTTP + JWT)
    BE->>AS: Validate JWT token
    AS->>BE: Confirm token valid
    BE->>BE: Generate temporary ticket
    BE->>FE: Return ticket (30s TTL)

    Note over C,WS: Phase 2: WebSocket Connection with Ticket
    FE->>WS: Connect WebSocket + ticket in URL
    WS->>WS: Validate ticket (consume once)
    WS->>AS: Exchange ticket for user context
    AS->>WS: Return user context
    WS->>FE: WebSocket connected + authenticated

    Note over C,WS: Phase 3: Secure WebSocket Communication
    FE->>WS: Send chat message
    WS->>WS: Process with user context
    WS->>FE: Return AI response + events
```

### Key Components

1. **Ticket Generation Endpoint**
   - HTTP endpoint: `POST /websocket/ticket`
   - Requires valid JWT Authorization header
   - Returns short-lived ticket (30 seconds TTL)
   - Single-use consumption pattern

2. **WebSocket Authentication**
   - Ticket passed as query parameter: `wss://api.example.com/ws?ticket=<ticket>`
   - Ticket validation and consumption on connection
   - Full user context establishment from auth service

3. **Security Features**
   - Short TTL prevents replay attacks
   - Single-use tickets prevent reuse
   - Secure ticket generation with cryptographic randomness
   - Full audit logging of ticket lifecycle
