# 🎯 Multi-Agent Parallel Execution Plan: Agent Restart Failure Resolution

## Executive Summary
This plan orchestrates 8 specialized agent teams to resolve the critical agent restart failure that causes system-wide outages. The plan emphasizes **Chat is King** - ensuring reliable, isolated, and valuable AI interactions for every user.

## Business Context
**CRITICAL**: Chat delivers 90% of our business value. When agents fail and don't restart, we lose:
- Customer trust (users see stuck "triage start" forever)
- Revenue (complete service disruption)
- Market position (unreliable = unusable)

**Success Metric**: 100% request isolation - one user's failure NEVER affects another.

## Phase 2: Factory Pattern Migration (Remaining Work)

### 🔧 Agent Team 1: Factory Migration Core
**Mission**: Complete factory pattern implementation across all agent creation points

**Prompt for Agent**:
```
You are a specialized refactoring agent focused on migrating singleton patterns to factory-based isolation.

CONTEXT:
- Chat is King: User interactions must be 100% isolated
- Current issue: Singleton agents cause cascade failures across ALL users
- Business impact: Complete service outage from single failure

YOUR TASK:
1. Search for ALL agent instantiation points using grep/glob
2. Replace every direct Agent() call with factory.create_agent()
3. Remove ALL singleton storage from AgentRegistry
4. Update agent_execution_registry.py to use factory pattern
5. Validate ZERO singleton patterns remain

FILES TO MODIFY:
- netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/agent_registry.py
- netra_backend/app/orchestration/agent_execution_registry.py
- All files containing "Agent(" or "get_agent"

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Each user request MUST get fresh agent instance
- No state persistence between requests
- Factory must support 100+ concurrent instances
- Instance creation <10ms

VALIDATION:
- Run: python tests/mission_critical/test_complete_request_isolation.py
- Verify: No singleton patterns in codebase
- Test: 10 concurrent users with random failures

Remember: One failure affecting all users is UNACCEPTABLE. Think like solving for 95% of cases first.
```

YOUR TASK:
1. Analyze WebSocket event flow in netra_backend/app/websocket/
2. Implement connection-scoped WebSocket managers
3. Add user_context to EVERY WebSocket message
4. Create hard isolation boundaries for events
5. Test with 5+ concurrent WebSocket connections

CRITICAL PATTERNS TO IMPLEMENT:

- Events tagged with connection_id AND user_id
- No shared state in WebSocket handlers
- Automatic cleanup on disconnect

FILES TO MODIFY:
- netra_backend/app/websocket/manager.py
- netra_backend/app/websocket/connection_handler.py
- All WebSocket event dispatchers

VALIDATION:
- Connect 5 users simultaneously
