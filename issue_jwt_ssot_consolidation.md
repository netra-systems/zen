# JWT Authentication SSOT Architecture Consolidation

## Problem
JWT authentication logic is duplicated across multiple services (backend, auth, websocket) instead of following SSOT patterns, creating maintenance overhead and potential inconsistencies.

## Current State Analysis
Based on analysis of issue #930, the authentication system has several anti-patterns:

### Authentication Complexity Issues:
1. **Service Independence**: Each service handles JWT independently rather than through shared SSOT
2. **Multiple Secret Sources**: System supports os.environ, Cloud Run config, and GCP Secret Manager without clear precedence
3. **Legacy Patterns**: Mix of singleton caching and factory patterns creating inconsistent behavior
4. **Cross-Service Token Validation**: Services generate and validate JWT tokens independently, risking mismatches

### Code Duplication Found:
- **JWT Secret Manager Instances**: Multiple services creating their own JWT managers
- **Authentication Logic**: Each service has its own JWT validation rather than shared middleware
- **Environment Variable Mocking**: Tests show ad-hoc mocking rather than unified patterns

## Solution: SSOT Consolidation

### Phase 1: Centralize JWT Management
- [ ] Create single `JWTManager` SSOT class in `/shared`
- [ ] Consolidate JWT secret resolution logic
- [ ] Establish clear environment variable precedence hierarchy
- [ ] Remove duplicate JWT handling from individual services

### Phase 2: Unified Authentication Middleware
- [ ] Create shared authentication middleware for all services
- [ ] Implement service-to-service authentication patterns
- [ ] Standardize JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Add cross-service authentication contracts

### Phase 3: Configuration Standardization
- [ ] Establish single source of truth for JWT configuration
- [ ] Implement startup-time validation of JWT configuration consistency
- [ ] Add runtime health monitoring for JWT secret consistency
- [ ] Create clear documentation of configuration precedence

## Business Impact
- **Segment:** Platform/Architecture
- **Business Goal:** Reduce maintenance overhead and improve system reliability
- **Value Impact:** Eliminates JWT-related inconsistencies and reduces debugging time
- **Strategic Impact:** Establishes SSOT patterns for other shared components

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Single JWT manager class used by all services
- [ ] No duplicate JWT authentication logic
- [ ] Clear configuration precedence documented and enforced
- [ ] All services use shared authentication middleware
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for JWT SSOT patterns

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Assessment Phase**: Audit current JWT usage across all services
2. **Design Phase**: Create SSOT JWT architecture design
3. **Migration Phase**: Gradual migration of services to SSOT patterns
4. **Validation Phase**: Comprehensive testing and verification

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: Resolution of immediate infrastructure issues (related issues)
- **Architecture**: SSOT architecture patterns established
- **Testing**: SSOT test infrastructure available

## Related Issues
- **Parent Issue:** #930 (JWT configuration failures)
- **Immediate Fix**: [JWT Staging Configuration issue] (infrastructure fix)
- **Documentation**: [JWT Authentication Documentation issue] (to be created)

## Timeline
- **Priority:** P2 (Important, not urgent)
- **Estimate:** 2-3 sprints
- **Dependencies:** Infrastructure fixes completed first

## Notes
- This addresses the **architectural complexity** identified in issue #930
- Should NOT block immediate infrastructure fixes
- Represents long-term technical debt reduction
- Aligns with ongoing SSOT remediation efforts (98.7% compliance achieved)
