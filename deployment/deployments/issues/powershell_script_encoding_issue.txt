DEPLOYMENT ISSUE: PowerShell Script Encoding/Smart Quotes
Date: 2025-08-19
Script: deploy-staging-reliable.ps1

PROBLEM:
--------
PowerShell deployment script failed to execute with syntax errors:
- "The string is missing the terminator" error at line 581
- Multiple "Missing closing '}'" errors cascade from this initial error

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
Smart quotes (Unicode characters U+201C and U+201D) were present in the PowerShell script
instead of regular ASCII double quotes (U+0022). These appeared on lines:
- Line 92: $env:GCP_STAGING_SA_KEY_PATH
- Line 96: .gcp/staging-sa-key.json path
- Line 262: frontend.gcp.Dockerfile (formerly Dockerfile.frontend.staging)
- Line 264: frontend.gcp.Dockerfile (formerly Dockerfile.frontend.optimized)  
- Line 266: Dockerfile fallback comment

SYMPTOMS:
---------
1. PowerShell parser error: "The string is missing the terminator: "
2. Cascading syntax errors about missing closing braces
3. Script completely fails to execute

ATTEMPTED FIXES:
----------------
1. Tried to identify the issue by checking hex dumps of line 581
2. Used sed to replace smart quotes with regular quotes
3. Created cleaned version of file with iconv
4. Multiple attempts to fix via different methods

RESOLUTION:
-----------
Need to systematically replace all smart quotes in the file:
sed -i 's/[\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d]/"/g' deploy-staging-reliable.ps1

However, the issue persisted even after this fix, suggesting either:
- Additional hidden Unicode characters
- Corruption during file transfer/editing
- Windows/Unix line ending conflicts

WORKAROUND:
-----------
Deployed services directly using gcloud commands instead of the PowerShell script:
1. Built Docker image: docker build -f auth.gcp.Dockerfile -t [image_tag] .
2. Pushed to registry: docker push [image_tag]
3. Deployed to Cloud Run: gcloud run deploy [service_name] --image [image_tag] ...

PREVENTION:
-----------
1. Always use plain text editors that show Unicode characters
2. Validate PowerShell scripts with: [System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile()
3. Use consistent text encoding (UTF-8 without BOM)
4. Avoid copy-pasting from rich text sources (Word, web pages, etc.)
5. Consider using bash scripts for cross-platform compatibility
