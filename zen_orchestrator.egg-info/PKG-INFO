# Zen User Guide

Zen runs multiple Code CLI instances for peaceful parallel task execution.

## What is Zen?

Zen allows you to:
- Run multiple Claude Code CLI instances simultaneously (Codex support coming soon)
- Calm results (status, time, token usage)
- Relax **"5-hour limit reached"** lockout fears with easy token budget limits
- Get more value out of your Claude MAX subscription
with scheduling features. (`--run-at "2am"`) 

## Inspiration and background
While developing Netra Apex (commerical product)
our team has been running 100s of parrallel claude code instances.
During that process we got annoyed at the "cognitive overhead"
of each having 10s of terminals open per machine and scrolling mountains of text.
Did the `/command` work or not?

What started as a simple way to make that process more peaceful turned into something we believe will be useful to the community.

Further, as usage limits become more restrictive, getting up at odd hours just to feed the beast got old fast. So we added scheduling to run it at pre-defined times.

Surprisingly, the duration that a command ran and it's presumed difficulty, often had little correlation with actual token usage.
"Simple" git operations would sometimes eat 10x as many as complex issue resolution commands.

The market is moving quickly, codex is getting better and other Code CLIs are coming. How effective a code factory is matters. This V1 alpha is just the start of codifying code CLI dev practices and progressing from alchemy to engineering.

Commercial users who wish to may seemlessly use Zen with Netra Apex (Commercial Product) for the most effective usage and control of business AI spend.


## Installation

### Default Method: pipx (Recommended for ALL Users)

Pipx automatically handles PATH configuration and creates an isolated environment, preventing dependency conflicts.

#### Step 1: Install pipx
```bash
# Windows
pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath

# macOS
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pipx
pipx ensurepath

# Linux (Other)
pip install --user pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

**Note:** Restart your terminal after running `pipx ensurepath`

#### Step 2: Install zen
```bash
# From PyPI (when published)
pipx install zen-orchestrator

# For local development (editable mode)
cd zen/
pipx install --editable .

# Verify installation
zen --help
```

### Alternative: pip (Manual PATH Configuration Required)

⚠️ **Warning:** Using pip directly often results in PATH issues. We strongly recommend pipx instead.

```bash
pip install zen-orchestrator

# If 'zen' command not found, you'll need to:
# Option 1: Use Python module directly
python -m zen_orchestrator --help

# Option 2: Manually add to PATH (see Troubleshooting)
```

## Expected questions

### 1. Do I have to use /commands?
No. You can just put your string query (prompt) and it works the same.
It does seem to be a best practice though to version controlled `/commands`.

### 2. Does this replace using Claude command directly?
No. At least not yet fully.
As we primarily using structured commands, internally we see 80%+ of our usage through Zen.
Ad hoc questions or validating if a command is working as expected for now is better through Claude directly.

### 3. What does this assume?
- You have claude code installed, authenticated, and configured already.

## Known Issues and Solutions

### Windows Permission Errors (Issue #1320)
**Problem:** Commands may fail with "This command requires approval" on Windows.

**Solution:** Zen now automatically detects Windows and uses `bypassPermissions` mode. If you still experience issues, see [Issue #1320 Documentation](../docs/issues/ISSUE_1320_ZEN_PERMISSION_ERROR_FIX.md).

### Platform-Specific Behavior
Zen automatically adjusts permission modes based on your platform:
- **Windows**: Uses `bypassPermissions` to avoid approval prompts
- **Mac/Linux**: Uses standard `bypassPermissions` mode

For more details, see [Cross-Platform Compatibility](docs/CROSS_PLATFORM_COMPATIBILITY.md).
- All existing config stays the same unless expressly defined in Zen.
- - e.g. if your have your model set to Opus and don't change it per command in Zen, then all
Claude Zen instances use Opus.

### 4. How do I know if it's working?
- Each command returns fairly clear overall statuses.
- Budget states etc. are logged.
- You can also see the duration and token usage.
- By default, each command outputs a truncated version of the output to the console.
- You can optionaly choose to save a report of all output to .json
- Our usage is heavily integrated with github, we use git issues as the visual output 
and notification system for most work. This means regardless of where Zen is running
you can see the results wherever you access git. This is as easy as adding `gh` instructions (the cli + token assumed to be present) to your commands.

### 5. Data privacy?
At this moment no data is collected. Our intent is to add an optional system where non-PII usage data is sent to Netra for exclusively aggregated metadata level use to help make our spend management system better. (So you can get more from your AI spend!)

## 6. What about the UI/UX?
There is a time and a place for wanting to have multiple windows and git trees open.
Zen's intent is the opposite: make running `n` code clis more peaceful.
Why activate your "giga-brain" when you can run one command instead?


## Configuration

Create a JSON file with your tasks:

```json
{
  "instances": [
    {
      "name": "task-1",
      "command": "/my-command",
      "description": "What this task does"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Integration with Claude Code

Zen works seamlessly with Claude Code workspaces:

1. Navigate to your Claude Code project:
```bash
cd ~/projects/my-claude-project
```

2. Run Zen to orchestrate multiple instances:
```bash
zen --config zen-config.json
```

3. Monitor the execution:
- Real-time status updates
- Token usage tracking
- Progress visualization

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Set default workspace
export ZEN_WORKSPACE="~/projects"

# Set default config
export ZEN_CONFIG="~/configs/zen-default.json"

# Enable debug logging
export ZEN_DEBUG="true"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

#### If using pipx (recommended):
```bash
# Ensure PATH is configured
pipx ensurepath

# Restart terminal, then verify
zen --version
```

#### If using pip (not recommended):
```bash
# Find where pip installed zen
pip show zen-orchestrator

# Use Python module directly (always works)
python -m zen_orchestrator --help

# Or manually add to PATH:
# Windows: Add %APPDATA%\Python\Python3X\Scripts to PATH
# macOS/Linux: Add ~/.local/bin to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"  # Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
```

### Permission denied
```bash
# Make sure scripts are executable
chmod +x $(which zen)
```

### Module not found
```bash
# Reinstall with dependencies
pip install --force-reinstall zen-orchestrator
```
