## 1. Pre-Deployment Infrastructure Validation

### 1.1. Infrastructure Team Handback Criteria

**Before proceeding with service deployment, confirm infrastructure team has achieved:**

```bash
# Primary validation - run this first
python scripts/infrastructure_health_check_issue_1278.py

# Expected output:
# Overall Status: HEALTHY
# Critical Failures: 0
# Warnings: 0 (or minimal warnings only)
```

**Infrastructure Component Checklist:**
- [ ] **VPC Connector:** `staging-connector` state = "READY" with adequate capacity
- [ ] **Cloud SQL:** `netra-staging-db` state = "RUNNABLE" with private IP connectivity
- [ ] **SSL Certificates:** Valid certificates deployed for `*.netrasystems.ai` domains
- [ ] **Load Balancer:** Health checks configured for 600s timeout accommodation
- [ ] **Secret Manager:** All 10 required secrets validated and accessible

### 1.2. Infrastructure Validation Commands

**Quick Infrastructure Health Check:**
```bash
# VPC Connector status
gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors describe staging-connector \
  --region=us-central1 --project=netra-staging \
  --format="value(state)"
# Expected: "READY"

# Cloud SQL status
gcloud sql instances describe netra-staging-db --project=netra-staging \
  --format="value(state)"
# Expected: "RUNNABLE"

# SSL certificate validation
curl -I https://staging.netrasystems.ai 2>&1 | head -1
curl -I https://api-staging.netrasystems.ai 2>&1 | head -1
# Expected: HTTP/2 200 for both

# Secret Manager validation
python scripts/infrastructure_health_check_issue_1278.py --secrets-only
# Expected: All secrets validated successfully
```

## 2. Service Deployment & Initial Validation

### 2.1. Service Deployment Sequence

**Deploy services in dependency order:**

```bash
# 1. Deploy auth service first (foundation dependency)
python scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py --project netra-staging --service auth --build-local

# 2. Deploy backend service (depends on auth + database)
python scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py --project netra-staging --service backend --build-local

# 3. Deploy frontend service (depends on backend + auth)
python scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py --project netra-staging --service frontend --build-local
```

**Deployment Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All deployments complete without errors
- [ ] Services reach "READY" state within 10 minutes
- [ ] No CRITICAL errors in deployment logs
- [ ] Health endpoints accessible within 60 seconds post-deployment

### 2.2. Service Health Validation

**Immediate Health Check:**
```bash
# Wait for services to stabilize (2-3 minutes)
sleep 180

# Check all health endpoints
curl -f https://staging.netrasystems.ai/health -w "Frontend: %{http_code}, Time: %{time_total}s\n"
curl -f https://api-staging.netrasystems.ai/health -w "Backend: %{http_code}, Time: %{time_total}s\n"
curl -f https://staging.netrasystems.ai/auth/health -w "Auth: %{http_code}, Time: %{time_total}s\n"
```

**Expected Results:**
- Frontend: 200, Time: < 5s
- Backend: 200, Time: < 5s
- Auth: 200, Time: < 5s

**Service Deployment Logs Review:**
```bash
# Check for deployment issues
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=netra-backend-staging" \
  --limit=50 --format="table(timestamp,severity,textPayload)" \
  --project=netra-staging

gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=auth-staging" \
  --limit=50 --format="table(timestamp,severity,textPayload)" \
  --project=netra-staging
```

### 2.3. Database Connectivity Validation

**Test database connectivity post-deployment:**
```bash
# Run database connectivity tests
python tests/integration/issue_1278_database_connectivity_integration_simple.py

# Expected: All database connection tests pass
# Expected: Connection times < 35 seconds
# Expected: No timeout or connection pool errors
```

**Database Performance Check:**
```bash
# Test database response times
python -c "
import asyncio
import time
from netra_backend.app.core.database_manager import DatabaseManager

async def test_db_performance():
    db = DatabaseManager()
    start = time.time()
    await db.initialize()
    init_time = time.time() - start

    start = time.time()
    result = await db.test_connection()
    query_time = time.time() - start

    print(f'Database initialization: {init_time:.2f}s')
    print(f'Test query: {query_time:.2f}s')
    print(f'Connection successful: {result}')

    await db.cleanup()

asyncio.run(test_db_performance())
"

  --limit=100 --format="table(timestamp,severity,textPayload)" \
  --project=netra-staging \
  --freshness=1h

# Check for Issue #1278 specific patterns
gcloud logging read "textPayload:'timeout' OR textPayload:'connection' OR textPayload:'VPC'" \
  --limit=50 --format="table(timestamp,severity,textPayload)" \
  --project=netra-staging \
  --freshness=1h
```

**Expected Log Health:**
