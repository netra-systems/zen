# SSOT Test Infrastructure Violations #1075 - Progress Tracker

**Issue**: https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/1075  
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Focus**: Critical test infrastructure SSOT violations blocking Golden Path  
**Branch**: develop-long-lived  

## Critical Violations Discovered

### ðŸš¨ HIGHEST PRIORITY: Direct pytest.main() Bypassing Unified Test Runner
- **20+ files** directly executing pytest instead of SSOT unified_test_runner.py
- **Golden Path Risk**: WebSocket authentication and agent execution tests not running through proper orchestration
- **Business Impact**: $500K+ ARR chat functionality validation at risk

### ðŸš¨ MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE: Multiple BaseTestCase Implementations  
- **1343+ test files** affected by BaseTestCase inheritance fragmentation
- **Critical Gap**: Tests missing SSOT environment isolation, metrics recording, and WebSocket utilities
- **Golden Path Risk**: Core business tests lacking proper test infrastructure foundation

### ðŸš¨ RESOURCE CONFLICT: Orchestration Infrastructure Duplication
- **129+ files** with competing orchestration systems
- **Key Problem**: Multiple test runners/orchestrators competing with unified system
- **Golden Path Risk**: Resource conflicts preventing proper Docker/WebSocket test coordination

## Process Status

- [x] Step 0: SSOT Audit Complete - Issue Created
- [ ] Step 1: Discover and Plan Test 
- [ ] Step 2: Execute Test Plan (20% New SSOT Tests)
- [ ] Step 3: Plan Remediation 
- [ ] Step 4: Execute Remediation
- [ ] Step 5: Test Fix Loop
- [ ] Step 6: PR and Closure

## Work Log

### 2025-09-14 - Step 0 Complete
- GitHub issue #1075 created with critical SSOT test infrastructure violations
- Top 3 violations prioritized by Golden Path impact
- Ready for test discovery and planning phase

## Next Actions
- Step 1: Spawn sub-agent to discover existing tests protecting against SSOT refactor breaking changes
- Focus on unified_test_runner.py, BaseTestCase, and orchestration infrastructure
