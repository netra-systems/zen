# SSOT-incomplete-migration-websocket-agent-testing-foundation

**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/1035  
**Priority:** P0 - BLOCKS PRODUCTION  
**Focus:** WebSocket & Agent Testing SSOT Migration  

## Status: DISCOVERY COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Issue Summary
20+ test files testing WebSocket authentication, agent execution, and user isolation bypass SSOT testing infrastructure, creating risk of hidden failures in core chat functionality.

## Business Impact
- **Golden Path Risk:** WebSocket event delivery and agent response testing inconsistency
- **$500K+ ARR Risk:** Chat functionality testing reliability compromised
- **Production Risk:** Silent test failures could hide critical business functionality bugs

## SSOT Violations Identified
1. **Non-SSOT Base Classes:** WebSocket tests not inheriting from SSotBaseTestCase
2. **Direct pytest Usage:** Tests bypassing unified_test_runner.py  
3. **Custom Mock Patterns:** Ad-hoc mocks instead of SSotMockFactory
4. **Environment Access:** Direct os.environ instead of IsolatedEnvironment

## Critical Files Requiring Remediation
- `/tests/websocket/` directory tests
- `/netra_backend/tests/websocket_core/` tests
- Agent execution test files
- WebSocket authentication integration tests

## Progress Tracking

### üîç STEP 0: DISCOVER NEXT SSOT ISSUE ‚úÖ
- [x] SSOT audit completed
- [x] GitHub issue created: #1035
- [x] Progress tracker created
- [x] Initial commit planned

### üß™ STEP 1: DISCOVER AND PLAN TEST
- [ ] 1.1: DISCOVER EXISTING - Find existing tests protecting WebSocket/Agent functionality
- [ ] 1.2: PLAN ONLY - Plan test updates for SSOT compliance

### üî® STEP 2: EXECUTE TEST PLAN
- [ ] Execute 20% new SSOT tests creation
- [ ] Audit and review tests
- [ ] Run non-docker test validation

### üìã STEP 3: PLAN REMEDIATION
- [ ] Plan SSOT remediation strategy

### ‚ö° STEP 4: EXECUTE REMEDIATION
- [ ] Execute SSOT remediation plan

### üîÑ STEP 5: TEST FIX LOOP
- [ ] Prove changes maintain system stability
- [ ] Fix failing tests
- [ ] Run startup tests
- [ ] Repeat until all tests pass

### üöÄ STEP 6: PR AND CLOSURE
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Cross-link issue for closure

## Next Actions
1. Spawn sub-agent for STEP 1: Discover existing tests
2. Focus on WebSocket critical path tests first
3. Maintain Golden Path functionality throughout migration
