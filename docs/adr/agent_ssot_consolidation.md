# ADR: Agent SSOT Consolidation and Golden Pattern

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - Implementation Complete via TriageSubAgent

## Business Context

### Business Value Justification (BVJ)
- **Segment**: Platform/Internal + ALL customer segments (indirect)
- **Business Goal**: Platform Stability + Development Velocity + Customer Experience
- **Value Impact**: +25% reduction in agent development time, +90% reduction in SSOT violations, improved chat reliability
- **Strategic Impact**: $50K+ engineering cost savings annually, reduced customer-facing bugs, faster time-to-market for new features

## Problem Statement

### The Infrastructure Duplication Crisis

Prior to this decision, our agent system suffered from severe SSOT violations:

1. **Infrastructure Duplication**: Every agent reimplemented WebSocket handlers, retry logic, execution engines, and health monitoring
2. **Inconsistent User Experience**: Different agents provided different quality WebSocket events, impacting chat value delivery
3. **High Technical Debt**: 5+ different implementations of similar infrastructure patterns across agents
4. **Development Velocity Bottleneck**: 60-80% of agent code was boilerplate infrastructure
5. **Testing Complexity**: Each agent required independent testing of common infrastructure

### Critical Business Impact

- **Chat Experience Degradation**: Inconsistent real-time updates hurt primary value delivery channel
- **Development Bottleneck**: New agent development took 3-5x longer than necessary
- **Reliability Issues**: Inconsistent error handling led to user-facing failures
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Infrastructure bugs required fixes in multiple agents

## Decision

### Core Decision: SSOT BaseAgent Pattern

**We will consolidate ALL agent infrastructure into a single BaseSubAgent class that provides:**

1. **WebSocket Event Management**: Standardized real-time chat communication
2. **Reliability Patterns**: Circuit breakers, retry logic, health monitoring
3. **Execution Infrastructure**: Modern execution engines with monitoring
4. **State Management**: Lifecycle and transition management
5. **Observability**: Timing, metrics, and health status reporting

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Enhanced BaseAgent (Completed)
- Created comprehensive BaseSubAgent with all infrastructure
- Implemented WebSocketBridgeAdapter for SSOT event emission
- Added reliability management with modern and legacy compatibility
- Integrated execution engines with comprehensive monitoring

#### Phase 2: Golden Pattern via TriageSubAgent (Completed)
- Migrated TriageSubAgent to use BaseAgent infrastructure exclusively
- Reduced from 300+ lines to 178 lines (40% code reduction)
- Achieved zero infrastructure duplication
- Established golden pattern for all future agents

#### Phase 3: Documentation and Standards (This Document)
- Comprehensive golden pattern guide
- Step-by-step migration checklist
- Architecture decision record with lessons learned

class BaseSubAgent(ABC):
    """SSOT for ALL agent infrastructure"""
    
    # WebSocket Events (Lines 272-318)
    async def emit_thinking(self, thought: str)
    async def emit_tool_executing(self, tool_name: str)
    async def emit_agent_completed(self, result: Dict)
    # ... all WebSocket events
    
    # Reliability Management (Lines 322-401)
    def _init_reliability_infrastructure(self)
    async def execute_with_reliability(self, operation, name, fallback)
    
    # Modern Execution Patterns (Lines 403-442)
    async def execute_modern(self, state, run_id, stream_updates)

    def get_health_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]
    def get_circuit_breaker_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

### TriageSubAgent Golden Pattern (178 lines)

```python
# File: netra_backend/app/agents/triage_sub_agent.py
class TriageSubAgent(BaseSubAgent):
    """Clean agent using ONLY BaseAgent infrastructure"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="TriageSubAgent",
            enable_reliability=True,      # Gets all reliability patterns
            enable_execution_engine=True, # Gets modern execution
            enable_caching=True,          # Gets caching infrastructure
        )
        # ONLY business logic initialization
        self.triage_core = TriageCore(self.redis_manager)
        self.processor = TriageProcessor(self.triage_core, self.llm_manager)
    
    # ONLY business logic methods - zero infrastructure
    async def validate_preconditions(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> bool:
        # Domain-specific validation only
        
    async def execute_core_logic(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Business logic with inherited WebSocket events
        await self.emit_thinking("Starting triage analysis...")
        # ... business processing ...
        await self.emit_progress("Analysis completed", is_complete=True)
        return result
```

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth (SSOT)
- **BaseAgent**: Contains ALL infrastructure, zero business logic
- **Sub-Agents**: Contains ONLY business logic, zero infrastructure
- **No Duplication**: Infrastructure patterns exist in exactly one place

### 2. Clean Inheritance Pattern
- Single inheritance from BaseSubAgent only
- No mixin patterns that create MRO complexity
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. Infrastructure as Composition
- Infrastructure initialized via constructor flags
- Business logic accesses via standardized properties
- Configuration-driven infrastructure selection

### 4. WebSocket Event Standardization
- All agents emit standardized events for chat value
- Real-time reasoning visibility via `emit_thinking()`
- Progress transparency via `emit_progress()`
- Tool usage transparency via `emit_tool_executing/completed()`

## Lessons Learned

### 1. MRO Complexity Management
**Challenge**: Complex inheritance hierarchies caused method resolution issues
**Solution**: Single inheritance pattern with composition for infrastructure
**Learning**: Always generate MRO reports before refactoring inheritance

### 2. WebSocket Integration Complexity
**Challenge**: Multiple WebSocket event systems created inconsistency
**Solution**: Single WebSocketBridgeAdapter with standardized event types
**Learning**: SSOT patterns require dedicated adapter layers for complex integrations

### 3. Backward Compatibility Requirements
**Challenge**: Legacy agents required gradual migration strategy
**Solution**: Legacy execute() methods that delegate to modern patterns
**Learning**: Always provide migration paths, never break existing integrations

### 4. Infrastructure Configuration Management
**Challenge**: Different agents needed different infrastructure components
**Solution**: Constructor flags for enabling/disabling infrastructure features
**Learning**: Infrastructure should be composable and configurable

## Future Considerations

### 1. Agent Expansion Strategy
- All new agents MUST use golden pattern
- Existing agents should migrate using provided checklist
- No exceptions without architecture committee approval

### 2. Infrastructure Evolution
- New infrastructure patterns go in BaseAgent only
- Breaking changes require migration guide and backward compatibility
- Regular architecture reviews to prevent SSOT degradation

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Monitor infrastructure overhead as agent count scales
- Consider lazy loading for optional infrastructure components
- Profile memory usage patterns under high agent concurrency

### 4. Cross-Service Patterns
- Evaluate extending pattern to other service types
- Consider shared infrastructure libraries across services
- Maintain service independence while reducing duplication
