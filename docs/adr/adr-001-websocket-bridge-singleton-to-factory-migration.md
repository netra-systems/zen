# ADR-001: WebSocket Bridge Singleton to Factory Pattern Migration

**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2025-09-08  
**Authors:** DevOps Agent Team, Five Whys Solution Architect  
**Reviewers:** Senior Engineering Team  

---

## Executive Summary

This ADR documents the architectural migration from singleton to factory pattern for WebSocket bridge components, addressing the root cause of runtime failures identified in the Five Whys analysis. This migration ensures proper user isolation, prevents WebSocket event failures, and preserves the 90% business value delivered through chat functionality.

**Business Context:** WebSocket events enable real-time chat interactions that represent 90% of platform value. The singleton pattern caused failures that broke user experience and risked $500K+ ARR.

---

## 1. Context and Problem Statement

### 1.1 Business Problem
**Root Issue:** Users experienced broken chat functionality due to WebSocket bridge configuration failures.

**Five Whys Analysis Results:**
- **WHY #1:** WebSocket bridge not available in agent factory
- **WHY #2:** Agent factory's WebSocket bridge was None  
- **WHY #3:** Incomplete singleton → factory migration left integration gaps
- **WHY #4:** Missing integration tests for startup → bridge → supervisor flow
- **WHY #5:** **ROOT CAUSE:** Lack of systematic approach to architectural migrations

### 1.2 Technical Problem
The existing singleton pattern for WebSocket bridge components created several critical issues:

1. **Multi-User Isolation Failures:** Single shared instance couldn't handle concurrent user sessions
2. **Startup Sequence Dependencies:** Brittle initialization order requirements
3. **Integration Point Fragility:** Changes to one component broke others unexpectedly
4. **Testing Complexity:** Difficult to test user-specific scenarios with global state

### 1.3 Previous Architecture (Singleton Pattern)
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[System Startup] --> B[Create Single WebSocket Bridge]
    B --> C[Store in app.state]
    C --> D[All Users Share Same Bridge]
    D --> E[User 1 Request]
    D --> F[User 2 Request]  
    E --> G[Same WebSocket Bridge Instance]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Potential State Conflicts]
```

**Problems with Singleton Pattern:**
- Shared state between users
- Difficult to test user-specific scenarios  
- Brittle startup dependencies
- No user context isolation

---

## 2. Decision Drivers

### 2.1 Business Requirements
- **Chat Functionality Must Work:** 90% of business value depends on WebSocket events
- **Multi-User Support:** System must handle 10+ concurrent users safely
- **Real-Time Updates:** Users must see AI reasoning in real-time
- **System Reliability:** Prevent runtime failures that break user experience

### 2.2 Technical Requirements  
- **User Isolation:** Each user gets independent WebSocket context
- **Startup Reliability:** Robust initialization with clear dependencies
- **Testing Support:** Enable comprehensive integration testing
- **Migration Safety:** Preserve existing functionality during transition

### 2.3 Compliance Requirements
- **SSOT Compliance:** Maintain single source of truth patterns
- **Contract-Driven Development:** Explicit contracts for all dependencies
- **E2E Authentication:** All tests use real auth (no mocks in E2E)

---

## 3. Decision

### 3.1 Chosen Solution: Factory Pattern with User Context Isolation

**Core Principle:** Each user request gets its own execution context with dedicated WebSocket bridge instance.

### 3.2 New Architecture (Factory Pattern)
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[System Startup] --> B[Create WebSocket Bridge Factory]
    B --> C[Store Factory in app.state]
    C --> D[User 1 Request]
    C --> E[User 2 Request]
    D --> F[Factory Creates User 1 Bridge]
    E --> G[Factory Creates User 2 Bridge]
    F --> H[User 1 Isolated Events]
    G --> I[User 2 Isolated Events]
```

**Benefits of Factory Pattern:**
- Complete user isolation
- Scalable for concurrent users
- Testable user-specific scenarios
- Clear dependency management

### 3.3 Implementation Strategy

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Key Components Modified

#### 4.1.1 ExecutionEngineFactory
**File:** `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/execution_engine_factory.py`

**Changes:**
```python
class ExecutionEngineFactory:
    def __init__(self, websocket_bridge: Optional[AgentWebSocketBridge] = None):
        # CRITICAL: Validate dependencies early (fail fast)
        if not websocket_bridge:
            raise ExecutionEngineFactoryError(
                "ExecutionEngineFactory requires websocket_bridge during initialization. "
                "This is required for WebSocket events that enable chat business value."
            )
        self._websocket_bridge = websocket_bridge
```

**Business Value:** Enables WebSocket events that deliver 90% of platform value through real-time agent reasoning visibility.

#### 4.1.2 System Startup (smd.py)
**File:** `netra_backend/app/smd.py`

**Changes:**
```python
# 5. Configure ExecutionEngineFactory with WebSocket bridge
execution_engine_factory = await configure_execution_engine_factory(
    websocket_bridge=self.app.state.agent_websocket_bridge
)
self.app.state.execution_engine_factory = execution_engine_factory
```

**Business Value:** Ensures WebSocket bridge is always available during agent execution.

#### 4.1.3 SupervisorFactory  
**File:** `netra_backend/app/websocket_core/supervisor_factory.py`

**Changes:**
- Handle UserContext-based tool_dispatcher creation
- Support both legacy and factory patterns during transition
- Create per-user tool dispatchers when needed

### 4.2 Contract Framework Implementation

#### 4.2.1 App State Contracts
**File:** `netra_backend/app/core/app_state_contracts.py`

**Purpose:** Validate that app.state contains all required components with proper types.

**Key Contracts:**
```python
contracts = {
    "websocket_connection_pool": AppStateContract(...),
    "agent_websocket_bridge": AppStateContract(...), 
    "execution_engine_factory": AppStateContract(...)
}
```

#### 4.2.2 Startup Phase Validation
**File:** `netra_backend/app/core/startup_phase_validation.py`

**Purpose:** Validate system initialization phases to prevent runtime failures.

**Phases:**
1. **INITIALIZATION:** Basic component creation
2. **CONFIGURATION:** Component setup and wiring
3. **INTEGRATION:** Cross-component dependencies  
4. **READINESS:** Full system operational validation

### 4.3 Integration Testing

#### 4.3.1 WebSocket Bridge Startup Integration
**File:** `tests/integration/test_websocket_bridge_startup_integration.py`

**Purpose:** Test complete startup → bridge → supervisor → agent execution flow.

**Critical Tests:**
1. Startup initializes WebSocket bridge properly
2. Bridge available to SupervisorFactory  
3. ExecutionEngineFactory bridge integration
4. UserExecutionContext WebSocket emitter creation
5. End-to-end agent WebSocket event flow
6. Contract validation startup integration

---

## 5. Validation & Testing

### 5.1 Contract Validation Testing
```bash
# Validate app state contracts
python -c "from netra_backend.app.core.app_state_contracts import validate_app_state_contracts; print(validate_app_state_contracts(app.state))"

# Validate startup phase contracts
python -c "from netra_backend.app.core.startup_phase_validation import validate_complete_startup_sequence; print(validate_complete_startup_sequence(app.state))"
```

### 5.2 Integration Testing
```bash  
# Test complete WebSocket bridge startup integration
python tests/integration/test_websocket_bridge_startup_integration.py

# Test WebSocket events end-to-end
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py
```

### 5.3 Business Value Validation
**Critical Requirement:** All 5 WebSocket events must be delivered:
1. `agent_started` - User sees agent began processing
2. `agent_thinking` - Real-time reasoning visibility
3. `tool_executing` - Tool usage transparency
4. `tool_completed` - Tool results display
5. `agent_completed` - User knows when response ready
