## Test Execution (Unified Test Runner SSOT)

### Mission Critical Validation (MUST PASS for deployment)
```bash
# Core business functionality protection
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category mission_critical

# WebSocket agent events validation (5 critical events)
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py

# Golden Path user flow validation
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category golden_path
```

### Agent Test Infrastructure
```bash
# Complete agent test suite (WebSocket bridge + BaseAgent + Integration)
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/unit/agents/ -v

# WebSocket bridge tests (68 tests, 57.4% success rate)
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/unit/agents/websocket_bridge/ -v

# BaseAgent infrastructure tests (113 tests, 92.04% success rate)
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/unit/agents/base_agent/ -v

# Agent integration tests (12 tests, 50% success foundation)
python -m pytest tests/integration/agents/ -v
```

### Standard Test Execution
```bash
# Real services integration (preferred)
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category integration --real-services

# Comprehensive test suite
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --categories smoke unit integration api agent

# Unit test development and debugging
cd netra_backend && python -m pytest tests/unit --tb=no -q --continue-on-collection-errors --maxfail=0

# Environment-specific validation
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --env staging
```

### SSOT Compliance Validation
```bash
# SSOT compliance verification
python tests/mission_critical/test_ssot_compliance_suite.py

# Mock policy enforcement
python tests/mission_critical/test_mock_policy_violations.py

# Architecture compliance check
