   - Production smoke tests for main branch

2. **Health Monitoring** (`health-monitoring.yml`)
   - Continuous monitoring of production and staging environments
   - Automated alert management and incident creation
   - Performance metrics collection and trending

3. **Pipeline Optimization** (`pipeline-optimization.yml`)
   - Automated analysis of pipeline performance and costs
   - Optimization recommendations and implementation planning
   - Cache strategy analysis and parallelization opportunities

4. **Workflow Orchestrator** (`orchestrator.yml`)

## Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Pre-flight Checks and Architecture Compliance

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Code Change] --> B[Pre-flight Checks]
    B --> C[Architecture Compliance]
    C --> D[Change Analysis]
    D --> E[Test Level Selection]
```

**Components:**
- **Pre-flight Checks**: Analyzes changed files and determines required test levels
- **Architecture Compliance**: Runs `check_architecture_compliance.py` to ensure 300-line modules and 8-line functions
- **Change Analysis**: Categorizes changes (security-sensitive, performance-critical, etc.)
- **Test Level Selection**: Automatically selects appropriate test level (smoke, unit, integration, comprehensive)

**Triggers:**
- Security-sensitive files → Integration tests + Security scan
- Performance-critical files → Integration tests + Performance tests
- Core system files → Comprehensive tests + All validations

### Stage 2: Security Scanning

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Security Scan Required] --> B[Bandit - Python Security]
    B --> C[Safety - Dependency Check]
    C --> D[Semgrep - Static Analysis]
    D --> E[Security Report]
    E --> F{Critical Issues?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Fail Pipeline]
    F -->|No| H[Continue]
```

**Security Tools:**
- **Bandit**: Python security linter for common security issues
- **Safety**: Checks Python dependencies for known security vulnerabilities
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis for custom security patterns

**Failure Handling:**
- Critical security issues immediately fail the pipeline
- Detailed security reports are generated and stored
- Security incidents are automatically created for tracking

### Stage 3: Core Testing with Coverage

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Test Execution] --> B[Unit Tests]
    B --> C[Integration Tests]
    C --> D[Coverage Analysis]
    D --> E{Coverage >= 85%?}
    E -->|No| F[Warning + Continue]
    E -->|Yes| G[Success]
    F --> H[PR Comment]
    G --> H
```

**Testing Strategy:**
- **Hierarchical Execution**: Smoke → Unit → Integration → Comprehensive
- **Parallel Matrix**: Multiple test environments and configurations
- **Coverage Requirements**: 85% minimum threshold with detailed reporting
- **Adaptive Testing**: Test level based on change analysis

**Coverage Features:**
- Combined coverage reports from all test runs
- HTML coverage reports with detailed file analysis

    D --> E[Performance Report]
    E --> F{Performance Acceptable?}
    F -->|No| G[Performance Warning]
    F -->|Yes| H[Continue]
```

**Performance Testing Components:**
- **Benchmark Tests**: Using pytest-benchmark for code performance
- **Load Testing**: Using Locust for API endpoint testing
- **Response Time Analysis**: Monitoring average response times
- **Performance Trending**: Historical performance data collection

**Performance Thresholds:**
- API response time: < 2 seconds average
- Database query time: < 500ms average
- Memory usage: < 512MB for typical operations

    F -->|No| G[Automatic Rollback]
    F -->|Yes| H[Staging Approved]
```

**Staging Features:**
- **Automatic Deployment**: Creates isolated staging environment
- **Health Validation**: Comprehensive endpoint testing
- **Critical Path Testing**: User journey validation
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Environment cleanup after validation

**Validation Checks:**
- `/health` endpoint returns 200
- `/api/v1/status` endpoint responds correctly
- Database connectivity verified

- **Resources**: CPU, memory, and storage utilization

### Alert Management

**Alert Levels:**
- **Critical**: System unavailable, immediate action required
- **Warning**: Degraded performance, monitoring required
- **Info**: Normal operations, informational only

**Automated Actions:**
- **Issue Creation**: Automatic GitHub issues for tracking
- **Escalation**: Progressive alert escalation
- **Resolution**: Automatic issue closure when resolved
- **Notification**: Multi-channel alert delivery

## Pipeline Optimization

### Performance Analysis

The optimization system analyzes pipeline performance monthly:

```python
# Optimization Metrics

```

**Optimization Categories:**
1. **Performance**: Duration reduction strategies
2. **Cost**: Resource usage optimization
3. **Parallelization**: Concurrent execution opportunities
4. **Caching**: Dependency and build artifact caching

### Automated Recommendations

The system generates actionable optimization recommendations:

```markdown
## Example Recommendations
