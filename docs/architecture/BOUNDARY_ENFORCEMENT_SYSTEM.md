# Boundary Enforcement System v2.0

## Overview

The Boundary Enforcement System is a comprehensive automated system that prevents architectural violations by enforcing the CLAUDE.md requirements:

- **File Size Limit**: ≤300 lines per file
- **Function Size Limit**: ≤8 lines per function  
- **Zero Duplicate Types**: Single source of truth
- **No Test Stubs**: Production code only

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Pre-commit Hooks** - Prevent violations at commit time
2. **CI/CD Integration** - Block merges with critical violations
3. **Real-time Monitoring** - Watch boundaries during development
4. **Emergency Response** - Automated actions for critical situations
5. **Automated Fixing** - Smart file splitting and function decomposition

## Usage Guide

### 1. Basic Boundary Checking

```bash
# Check all boundaries
python scripts/boundary_enforcer.py --enforce

# Check specific boundaries
python scripts/boundary_enforcer.py --check-file-boundaries
python scripts/boundary_enforcer.py --check-function-boundaries

# Generate JSON report
python scripts/boundary_enforcer.py --enforce --json-output report.json
```

### 2. Development Environment Monitoring

```bash
# Start dev environment with boundary monitoring
python dev_launcher.py --watch-boundaries

# Enable strict enforcement (stops on violations)
python dev_launcher.py --watch-boundaries --fail-on-boundary-violations

# Customize check interval
python dev_launcher.py --watch-boundaries --boundary-check-interval 60
```

### 3. Automated Fixing

```bash
# Scan for files that can be split
python scripts/auto_split_files.py --scan

# Analyze specific file
python scripts/auto_split_files.py --file app/large_file.py

# Function decomposition analysis
python scripts/auto_decompose_functions.py --scan --report
```

### 4. Emergency Response

```bash
# Assess emergency level
python scripts/emergency_boundary_actions.py --assess

# Execute automated emergency response
python scripts/emergency_boundary_actions.py --execute

# Generate emergency report
python scripts/emergency_boundary_actions.py --report
```

### 5. VS Code Integration

- **Rulers**: Visual 450-line boundary in editor
- **Tasks**: Quick access to boundary tools via Ctrl+Shift+P
- **Linting**: Real-time feedback with flake8 configuration

### 6. CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
- ✅ Runs boundary checks on all PRs
- ✅ Comments on PRs with detailed reports
- ✅ Blocks merges for emergency-level violations
- ✅ Uploads violation reports as artifacts
- ✅ Sets appropriate check statuses

## Configuration Options

### Dev Launcher Configuration

```python
# In dev_launcher/config.py
watch_boundaries: bool = False          # Enable real-time monitoring
boundary_check_interval: int = 30       # Check every N seconds
fail_on_boundary_violations: bool = False  # Stop on violations
show_boundary_warnings: bool = True     # Display warnings
```

### Pre-commit Hook Configuration

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: boundary-enforcer
        name: System Boundary Enforcer
        entry: python scripts/boundary_enforcer.py --enforce --fail-on-critical
        language: system
        files: '^(app|frontend|scripts)/'
```

## Enforcement Levels

### 1. Normal Operation (Green)
- Total violations: 0-10
- No critical violations
- System healthy

### 2. Warning Level (Yellow)
- Total violations: 11-50
- Some boundary violations
- Monitoring recommended

### 3. High Alert (Orange)
- Total violations: 51-100
- Multiple critical violations
- Immediate attention required

### 4. Emergency (Red)
- Total violations: >100 OR
- Emergency-level violations detected
- Automated response triggered

## Emergency Response Actions

### Critical Level (Emergency)
1. **Stop Development** - Halt all development processes
2. **Emergency Backup** - Create system backup
3. **Block Pipeline** - Prevent deployments
4. **Auto-split Files** - Automatically split oversized files
5. **Generate Report** - Comprehensive emergency analysis

### High Level
1. **Urgent Report** - Detailed violation analysis
2. **Auto-fix** - Apply automated fixes
3. **Create Issues** - GitHub issue tracking

### Medium Level
1. **Warning Report** - Status report generation
2. **Schedule Cleanup** - Plan maintenance tasks

## Automated Fixing Strategies

### File Splitting Strategies

1. **Class-based Splitting** (Confidence: 90%)
   - Split by class definitions
   - Maintain logical cohesion
   - Preserve inheritance relationships

2. **Function-based Splitting** (Confidence: 70%)
   - Group related functions
   - Common prefix/suffix patterns
   - Functional boundaries

3. **Logical Splitting** (Confidence: 60%)
   - Comment boundaries
   - Blank line separators
   - Natural breakpoints

### Function Decomposition Strategies

1. **Validation/Processing Split** (Confidence: 90%)
   - Extract input validation
   - Separate processing logic
   - Coordinate with main function

2. **Conditional Branch Extraction** (Confidence: 70%)
   - Extract complex if/else blocks
   - Create focused branch handlers
   - Maintain decision flow

3. **Error Handling Extraction** (Confidence: 60%)
   - Extract try/catch blocks
   - Create safe operation wrappers
   - Preserve error semantics

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Real-time Monitoring

The boundary monitor provides:
- **Continuous Scanning** - Check boundaries every 30 seconds
- **Alert Generation** - Immediate notification of violations
- **History Tracking** - Trend analysis and patterns
- **Performance Impact** - Minimal overhead (<1% CPU)

### Reports Generated

1. **Boundary Report** (`boundary-report.json`)
   - Complete violation inventory
   - System metrics and trends
   - Remediation suggestions

2. **Emergency Report** (`emergency_report.json`)
   - Critical violation analysis
   - Immediate action requirements
   - System health assessment

3. **PR Comments** (GitHub Integration)
   - Violation summary
   - Compliance scores
   - Automated recommendations

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Enable Monitoring** - Use `--watch-boundaries` during development
2. **Check Before Commit** - Run boundary checks locally
3. **Fix Immediately** - Address violations as they occur
4. **Use Auto-split** - Leverage automated splitting suggestions
5. **Monitor Trends** - Watch compliance scores over time

### For Teams

1. **Set Standards** - Enforce boundary compliance in code reviews
2. **Monitor Metrics** - Track system growth and health
3. **Respond to Alerts** - Act on emergency notifications
4. **Plan Refactoring** - Regular cleanup and optimization
5. **Document Changes** - Update architectural decisions

### For CI/CD

1. **Block Critical** - Prevent merges with emergency violations
2. **Generate Reports** - Provide detailed feedback
3. **Archive Results** - Maintain violation history
4. **Alert Teams** - Notify on trend changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Boundary check failing with import errors**
A: Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install radon ast-grep`

**Q: Pre-commit hooks not running**
A: Install hooks: `python scripts/boundary_enforcer.py --install-hooks`

**Q: False positives in violation detection**
A: Check exclusion patterns in `_should_skip_file()` methods

**Q: Performance impact from monitoring**
A: Adjust check interval: `--boundary-check-interval 60`

### Debugging Tools

```bash
# Verbose boundary checking
python scripts/boundary_enforcer.py --enforce --verbose

# Test specific file
python scripts/boundary_enforcer.py --file-boundaries app/specific_file.py

# Emergency assessment only
python scripts/emergency_boundary_actions.py --assess

# Generate detailed compliance report
python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py --json-output detailed.json
```
