# Terraform GCP Deployment Audit Report
Date: 2025-08-27
Environment: Staging (netra-staging)

## Executive Summary
Successfully remediated and deployed critical GCP infrastructure updates to address WebSocket support, security requirements, and load balancer configuration issues.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Load Balancer Configuration Fixes

#### Backend Services
- **Issue**: Cloud Run NEGs don't support timeout > 30 seconds
- **Fix**: Set `timeout_sec = 30` for all backend services (API, Auth, Frontend)
- **Impact**: WebSocket connections limited to 30-second timeout due to Cloud Run NEG limitations
- **Files Modified**: `terraform-gcp-staging/load-balancer.tf`

#### Protocol Headers
- **Implemented**: X-Forwarded-Proto header preservation for HTTPS
- **Configuration**: Added custom request headers to all backend services
- **Purpose**: Ensures backend services know requests came via HTTPS

#### URL Map Structure
- **Fixed**: Removed invalid `header_action` blocks from path_rule level
- **Corrected**: Header manipulation now properly configured at URL map top level
- **WebSocket Routes**: Dedicated path rules for `/ws`, `/websocket` with appropriate timeouts

### 2. Health Check Updates
- **Removed**: HTTP health check on port 8080
- **Added**: HTTPS health check on port 443
- **Path**: `/health` endpoint for all services
- **Protocol**: Changed from HTTP to HTTPS for production readiness

### 3. SSL Certificate Management
- **Recreated**: Google-managed SSL certificate for staging domains
- **Domains Covered**:
  - staging.netrasystems.ai
  - api.staging.netrasystems.ai
  - auth.staging.netrasystems.ai
  - www.staging.netrasystems.ai

### 4. Session Affinity Configuration
- **Enabled**: `GENERATED_COOKIE` session affinity for all backend services
- **TTL**: 3600 seconds cookie lifetime
- **Purpose**: Maintains WebSocket connection stability

### 5. CORS Policy
- **Origins**: HTTPS-only for staging/production
  - https://app.staging.netrasystems.ai
  - https://staging.netrasystems.ai
- **Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH
- **Credentials**: Allowed

### 6. Infrastructure Fixes

#### VPC Network
- **Issue**: VPC already existed but wasn't in Terraform state
- **Fix**: Imported existing VPC using `terraform import`
- **Resource**: `projects/netra-staging/global/networks/staging-vpc`

#### Storage Bucket Compliance
- **Issue**: Constraint violation for uniform bucket-level access
- **Fix**: Added `uniform_bucket_level_access = true`
- **Purpose**: Complies with organization security policies

#### Monitoring Alert Policy
- **Issue**: Invalid metric filter for security violations
- **Fix**: Changed resource type from `http_load_balancer` to `https_lb_rule`
- **Metric**: Monitors 4xx response codes for security violations

## Validation Results

### Terraform Apply Status
- Resources Created: 28
- Resources Modified: 4
- Resources Destroyed: 1
- Apply Status: Successful

### Key Resources Created
1. HTTPS health check
2. SSL certificate (Google-managed)
3. Cloud SQL instance with PostgreSQL
4. Redis instance
5. Secret Manager secrets for credentials
6. VPC peering for private services
7. Security monitoring and alerting

### Key Resources Modified
1. Backend services (timeout, session affinity, headers)
2. Cloud Armor security policy
3. URL map configuration
4. Security event logging

## Security Enhancements
1. **Cloud Armor**: Rate limiting and security rules active
2. **HTTPS Enforcement**: All traffic forced to HTTPS
3. **Security Logging**: Audit logs to dedicated GCS bucket
4. **Alert Policies**: Monitoring for security violations
5. **Secret Management**: All credentials in Secret Manager

## Known Limitations

### Cloud Run NEG Constraints
- Maximum timeout: 30 seconds (platform limitation)
- Cannot extend beyond this for WebSocket connections
- Consider alternative solutions for long-lived connections

### Session Affinity
- Cookie-based affinity may not work with all WebSocket clients
- Monitor connection stability in production

## Recommendations

1. **WebSocket Alternative**: Consider using Cloud Load Balancing with GKE for longer timeouts
2. **Monitoring**: Set up detailed WebSocket connection metrics
3. **Testing**: Perform load testing on WebSocket endpoints
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation with timeout limitations

## Compliance Status
✅ HTTPS protocol enforcement
✅ WebSocket path configuration
✅ Session affinity for connection stability
✅ CORS with HTTPS-only origins
✅ Security headers preservation
✅ Cloud Armor protection
✅ SSL certificate management
✅ Health check on HTTPS/443

## Next Steps
1. Monitor WebSocket connection stability
2. Review timeout requirements with application team
3. Consider migration to GKE for extended timeout support
4. Implement additional security monitoring
