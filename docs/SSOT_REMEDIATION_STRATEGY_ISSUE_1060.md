# SSOT Remediation Strategy - Issue #1060
**WebSocket Authentication Path Fragmentation - Golden Path Protection**

**Date:** 2025-09-14
**Mission:** Comprehensive SSOT consolidation to unblock Golden Path user flow
**Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR chat functionality protection
**Status:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Crisis:** Authentication path fragmentation is blocking the Golden Path user flow, with 143 separate JWT validation implementations and 7 WebSocket managers creating system-wide inconsistency that threatens $500K+ ARR in chat functionality.

**Solution:** Implement comprehensive but safe SSOT remediation to consolidate JWT validation and WebSocket management into single authorities while maintaining system stability and business continuity.

**Approach:** Three-phase incremental remediation with extensive safety measures, rollback procedures, and test-driven validation to ensure zero business disruption.

- Add any missing JWT operations (decode, validate, refresh, blacklist) to auth service
- Ensure auth service can handle all current JWT use cases across all services
- Performance optimization for increased load from consolidated requests

**Validation:**
- All JWT operations available in auth service
- Performance benchmarks meet SLA requirements
- Backward compatibility with existing JWT operations

#### 1.2 Backend JWT Integration Refactor

- Update auth integration to delegate ALL JWT operations to auth service via HTTP client
- Maintain existing FastAPI dependency injection interfaces to prevent breaking changes
- Add proper error handling and fallback mechanisms for auth service communication

**Validation:**
- Zero direct JWT operations in backend code
