 I've deployed 5 code quality review agents to analyze the worst parts of your system's type safety. Here are the
  critical findings:

  🔴 Most Critical Issues Found:

  1. Database Layer - Extensive use of Any types in schemas, untyped Dict usage, missing SQLAlchemy type
  annotations
  2. WebSocket System - 140+ uses of Dict[str, Any], untyped message payloads, frontend using any type
  3. Agent System - 108 occurrences of Dict[str, Any], missing return type annotations, untyped tool results
  4. Frontend - Pervasive any types in services, no runtime API validation, loose unknown types
  5. API/Services - CRITICAL BUG: Duplicate function definition causing runtime errors, missing return types

  🎯 Top 5 Action Items for 100% Type Safety:

  1. Fix critical bug - Duplicate stream_agent_response function in app/routes/agent_route.py
  2. Replace all Any types - Create specific Pydantic models for all data structures
  3. Implement discriminated unions - For WebSocket messages and agent results
  4. Add runtime validation - Use Zod/io-ts for frontend, Pydantic for backend
  5. Create type-safe protocols - For repositories, handlers, and service interfaces

  The system currently has significant type safety gaps that allow unvalidated data throughout the stack, creating
  risks for runtime errors and making refactoring dangerous. Implementing these fixes will provide compile-time
  safety and prevent many potential bugs.
