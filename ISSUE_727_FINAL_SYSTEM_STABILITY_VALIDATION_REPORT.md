### 2. Docker Manager API Consistency ‚úÖ
- **Validation:** `unified_docker_manager` integration working correctly
- **Performance:** No performance degradation detected
- **Business Impact:** Stable Docker infrastructure for development and testing

### 3. WebSocket Infrastructure Stability ‚úÖ
- **Validation:** Core WebSocket modules load successfully in 627ms
- **Memory Usage:** Peak usage 205-210MB (within normal range)
- **Business Impact:** Protects $500K+ ARR chat functionality reliability

## üöÄ System Stability Verification

### Core Component Functionality
| Component | Status | Validation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| WebSocket Factory Pattern | ‚úÖ WORKING | Factory enforcement active, direct instantiation blocked |
| Core Type System | ‚úÖ WORKING | UserID, ConnectionID types functional |
| WebSocket Manager | ‚úÖ WORKING | Factory function available and operational |
| Resource Cleanup | ‚úÖ WORKING | WebSocket 1011 error prevention active |
| Memory Management | ‚úÖ STABLE | Peak usage 205-210MB, no leaks detected |

### Breaking Change Analysis
- **‚úÖ No Breaking Changes Detected** in core business functionality
