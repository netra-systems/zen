Business Risk: Test framework showing false positives while $500K+ ARR infrastructure is completely failing, creating dangerous blind spots that prevent proper validation of Golden Path functionality.

Impact: Mission-critical test suites cannot run due to import failures, preventing validation of user login to AI responses flow.

Root Cause: Critical import chain failures preventing test framework accessibility - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named test_framework

Evidence:
1. False Positive Pattern - Tests passing while staging shows 503 errors across all services
2. Mission Critical Test Failure - WebSocket agent events test suite cannot execute  
3. E2E Collection Issues - 10 major import failures in unified_e2e_harness
4. SSOT Framework Inaccessible - Framework exists but not properly accessible from test suites

Business Impact:
- Golden Path Risk: Cannot validate users login to get AI responses flow
- Development Blocker: Team cannot verify fixes without functional test infrastructure
- Production Risk: False positive tests masking real infrastructure failures  
- Revenue Risk: $500K+ ARR functionality cannot be properly validated

Required Resolution:
1. Fix test_framework module import issues in mission-critical tests
2. Configure PYTHONPATH for proper test framework accessibility
3. Repair unified_e2e_harness import dependencies
4. Implement fail-hard testing when staging services unavailable

Priority Justification:
- P0 level due to development team inability to validate system state
- Must be resolved before addressing infrastructure issues Issue 1278
- Affects entire testing pipeline and development velocity

Acceptance Criteria:
- Mission-critical test suites can execute without import errors
- Tests fail properly when staging infrastructure is unavailable
- E2E test harness fully functional
- SSOT test framework properly accessible across all test categories' \\"
