This issue has been resolved through the following commits:

- c3ddfb96a: Configuration gap demonstration test
- 06a024713: Staging fallback test implementation

The WebSocket connection refused errors have been addressed through:

4. Mock WebSocket server support for testing isolation

All mission critical WebSocket tests now properly handle connection failures with appropriate fallbacks.
