# SSOT-regression-unauthorized-test-runners-blocking-golden-path

**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/1024
**Created:** 2025-09-14
**Status:** DISCOVERED - Ready for remediation planning

## CRITICAL BUSINESS IMPACT
**Revenue at Risk:** $500K+ ARR
**Golden Path Status:** BLOCKED - Chat functionality testing unreliable

## VIOLATION SUMMARY
- **74 unauthorized test runners** bypassing SSOT `tests/unified_test_runner.py`
- **1,909 direct pytest bypasses** creating test infrastructure chaos
- **Golden Path test reliability:** ~60% (should be >95%)

## IMMEDIATE IMPACT
1. **Agent WebSocket Events:** Testing inconsistent, blocking real-time chat
2. **Multi-User Security:** Cannot reliably test user isolation
3. **End-to-End Flow:** Login â†’ AI response testing compromised
4. **Infinite Debug Loops:** Different test runners producing different results

## DETAILED ANALYSIS

### Critical Unauthorized Test Runners (Examples)
- `scripts/run_golden_path_tests.py` - Direct Golden Path violation
- `scripts/run_critical_agent_tests.py` - Critical business logic bypass
- `tests/mission_critical/test_ssot_regression_prevention_monitor.py` - SSOT monitoring bypassed
- `netra_backend/tests/integration/startup/comprehensive_startup_test_runner.py` - Startup validation compromised

### Direct Pytest Bypasses (Examples)
- `tests/integration/test_agent_websocket_event_sequence_integration.py:489` - Golden Path WebSocket events
- `tests/critical/test_websocket_events_comprehensive_validation.py:1312` - Business-critical events
- `scripts/ssot_migration_automation.py` - 8 pytest.main() calls in SSOT tooling itself

## REMEDIATION PLAN

### âœ… COMPLETED STEPS
- [x] Issue created and documented
- [x] Initial audit completed via sub-agent
- [x] Business impact assessed
- [x] Priority 1 remediation plan defined

### ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS

#### STEP 1: DISCOVER AND PLAN TEST (In Progress)
- [ ] Find existing tests protecting against SSOT test runner violations
- [ ] Plan creation of SSOT enforcement tests
- [ ] Identify tests that must continue to pass after remediation

#### STEP 2: EXECUTE TEST PLAN
- [ ] Create SSOT enforcement tests
- [ ] Implement test_ssot_test_runner_enforcement.py
- [ ] Validate existing test suite integrity

#### STEP 3: PLAN REMEDIATION
- [ ] Systematic replacement plan for 74 unauthorized runners
- [ ] Migration strategy for 1,909 pytest.main() calls
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline updates

#### STEP 4: EXECUTE REMEDIATION
- [ ] Phase 1: Disable unauthorized test runners
- [ ] Phase 2: Replace direct pytest bypasses
- [ ] Phase 3: Update CI/CD scripts
- [ ] Phase 4: Create legacy wrappers

#### STEP 5: TEST FIX LOOP
- [ ] Run all existing tests - verify no regression
- [ ] Run new SSOT enforcement tests
- [ ] Fix any startup/import issues
- [ ] Iterate until 100% test pass rate

#### STEP 6: PR AND CLOSURE
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Cross-link issue for auto-closure
- [ ] Final validation of Golden Path reliability >95%

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Before Remediation:**
- 74 unauthorized test runners
- 1,909 direct pytest bypasses
- Golden Path test reliability: ~60%
- WebSocket event test success: ~40%

**After Remediation (Target):**
- 0 unauthorized test runners âœ…
- 0 direct pytest bypasses âœ…
- Golden Path test reliability: >95% âœ…
- WebSocket event test success: >90% âœ…

## BUSINESS VALUE JUSTIFICATION

**Segment:** Platform/Internal - Critical Infrastructure
**Business Goal:** Platform Stability & User Experience
**Value Impact:** Enables reliable $500K+ ARR chat functionality validation
**Strategic Impact:** Unblocks Golden Path development and deployment confidence

## PROGRESS LOG

### 2025-09-14 - Initial Discovery
- SSOT audit completed by sub-agent
- Critical violations identified and quantified
- GitHub issue created (#1024)
- Local tracking file initialized
- Ready to proceed to test discovery and planning phase
