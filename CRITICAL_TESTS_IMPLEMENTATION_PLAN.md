**Critical Path**: Upgrade → Payment → Invoice → Usage tracking
**Requirements**:
- Stripe webhook processing validation
- Accurate usage metering and cost calculation
- Subscription state transitions
- Invoice generation accuracy

### 3. TEST: Workspace Data Isolation and Multi-Tenancy
**Business Value**: Protects $50K+ Enterprise MRR from data leakage
**Critical Path**: User → Workspace → Data segregation → Access control
**Requirements**:
- Complete data isolation between workspaces
- Role-based access control enforcement
- Cross-workspace query prevention
- Audit trail validation

### 4. TEST: AI Supply Chain Failover and Redundancy
**Business Value**: Protects $75K+ MRR from LLM provider outages
**Critical Path**: Primary LLM → Failover → Secondary → Response delivery
**Requirements**:
- Automatic failover on provider failure
- Quality maintenance during failover
- Cost optimization during provider switching
- SLA compliance validation

### 5. TEST: Distributed Cache Coherence Across Services
**Business Value**: Protects $40K+ MRR from stale data issues
**Critical Path**: Write → Cache invalidation → Read consistency
**Requirements**:
- Redis cache invalidation across services
- PostgreSQL → Redis consistency
- WebSocket notification on cache updates
- TTL and eviction policy validation

### 6. TEST: Enterprise SSO/SAML Authentication Flow
**Business Value**: Protects $60K+ Enterprise MRR from auth failures
**Critical Path**: SAML request → IdP → Backend → Session creation
**Requirements**:
- SAML 2.0 assertion validation
- Session synchronization across services
- MFA integration testing
- Permission inheritance from IdP

### 7. TEST: Real-Time Metrics Aggregation Pipeline
**Business Value**: Protects $35K+ MRR from analytics failures
**Critical Path**: Events → ClickHouse → Aggregation → Dashboard
**Requirements**:
- Event ingestion at 10K events/second
- Real-time aggregation accuracy
- Dashboard update latency <2 seconds
- Data retention policy enforcement

### 8. TEST: Agent Quota Management and Fair Usage
**Business Value**: Protects $30K+ MRR from quota abuse
**Critical Path**: Request → Quota check → Execution → Decrement
**Requirements**:
- Per-tier quota enforcement
- Rate limiting per workspace
- Quota reset cycle validation
- Overage handling and notifications

### 9. TEST: WebSocket Message Ordering and Delivery Guarantees
**Business Value**: Protects $25K+ MRR from conversation corruption
**Critical Path**: Message → Queue → Delivery → Acknowledgment
**Requirements**:
- Message ordering preservation
- At-least-once delivery guarantee
- Duplicate detection and handling
- Reconnection with message recovery

### 10. TEST: Disaster Recovery and System Restoration
**Business Value**: Protects entire $500K+ MRR from catastrophic failures
**Critical Path**: Backup → Failure → Restore → Validation
**Requirements**:
- Database backup and restoration
- Configuration recovery
- Service dependency restoration order
- Data integrity validation post-recovery

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure Tests (Tests 1-3)
**Timeline**: 16 hours
**Agents**: 3 concurrent agents
- Agent 1: Real Agent Collaboration Test
- Agent 2: Payment Processing Test  
- Agent 3: Workspace Isolation Test

### Phase 2: Reliability Tests (Tests 4-6)
**Timeline**: 16 hours
**Agents**: 3 concurrent agents
- Agent 4: AI Supply Chain Failover Test
- Agent 5: Cache Coherence Test
- Agent 6: Enterprise SSO Test

### Phase 3: Performance Tests (Tests 7-9)
**Timeline**: 12 hours
**Agents**: 3 concurrent agents
- Agent 7: Metrics Pipeline Test
- Agent 8: Quota Management Test
- Agent 9: WebSocket Guarantees Test

### Phase 4: Recovery Test (Test 10)
**Timeline**: 4 hours
**Agents**: 1 dedicated agent
- Agent 10: Disaster Recovery Test

## Success Criteria
- All 10 tests implemented and passing
- Each test validates real behavior (no excessive mocking)
- Performance requirements met
- Tests complete in reasonable time (<5 minutes each)
- Architecture compliance (files <300 lines, functions <8 lines)

## Agent Instructions Template
Each agent will receive:
1. Specific test requirements and BVJ
2. File location: `tests/unified/e2e/test_[name].py`
3. Helper location: `tests/unified/e2e/[name]_helpers.py`
4. Architecture requirements (300/8 rule)
5. Performance requirements
6. Real behavior validation emphasis

## Execution Command
```bash
# After implementation, run all new tests:
python test_runner.py --level integration --real-llm --parallel 4

# Validate specific test:
pytest tests/unified/e2e/test_[name].py -v -s
```

## Risk Mitigation
- Use real services where possible, mock only external APIs
- Implement proper cleanup to avoid test pollution
- Add retry logic for flaky external services
- Document any discovered system issues for fixing

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Spawn 10 agents with specific test assignments
3. Monitor agent progress and provide guidance
4. Review completed tests for quality
5. Run all tests and fix any system issues discovered
6. Achieve 100% critical path coverage
