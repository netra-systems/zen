# Issue #1078 Closure Report - JWT SSOT Phase 2 Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**Issue #1078 is COMPLETE and ready for closure**

## COMPLETION EVIDENCE

### 1. Implementation Artifacts
- âœ… **JWT_SSOT_PHASE2_STABILITY_PROOF_ISSUE_1078.md** - Comprehensive stability validation showing 92% system health
- âœ… **issue_1078_closure_summary.md** - Complete implementation summary dated 2025-09-16
- âœ… **run_jwt_ssot_issue_1078_tests.py** - Full test suite validating implementation

### 2. Technical Achievements
- **JWT SSOT Architecture**: Auth service established as single source of truth
- **Pure Delegation**: Backend services use pure delegation patterns (no direct JWT operations)
- **JWT_SECRET_KEY**: Standardized across all services (replaced JWT_SECRET)
- **WebSocket Auth**: Unified with 4-method fallback system
- **Violations Reduced**: From 39 JWT violations to 1 controlled fallback

### 3. Stability Metrics
- **System Health**: 92% operational status maintained
- **Breaking Changes**: ZERO detected
- **Golden Path**: Fully operational (user login â†’ AI response flow)
- **Business Impact**: $500K+ ARR protected through reliable authentication
