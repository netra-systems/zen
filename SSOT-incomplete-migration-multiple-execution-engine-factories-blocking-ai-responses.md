# SSOT-incomplete-migration-multiple-execution-engine-factories-blocking-ai-responses

**GitHub Issue:** #884  
**Priority:** P0 CRITICAL  
**Status:** DISCOVERY COMPLETE  
**Focus:** Agent execution engine factory SSOT violations blocking AI responses

## Progress Tracker

### âœ… Step 0: SSOT Issue Discovery (COMPLETE)
- **Agent SSOT Audit:** COMPLETE via sub-agent
- **Critical Violation Identified:** Multiple execution engine factories
- **GitHub Issue Created:** #884 
- **Impact Assessment:** Direct Golden Path blockage
- **Business Risk:** Primary chat functionality at risk

### ðŸ“‹ Step 1: DISCOVER AND PLAN TEST (NEXT)
- [ ] 1.1 Find existing tests protecting agent execution engine functionality
- [ ] 1.2 Plan new SSOT validation tests for execution engine factories
- [ ] Target: ~20% new tests, ~60% existing test validation, ~20% SSOT verification

### ðŸ“‹ Step 2: EXECUTE TEST PLAN (PENDING)
- [ ] Create new SSOT tests for execution engine factory consolidation
- [ ] Validate tests can reproduce current SSOT violations
- [ ] Run non-docker tests only (unit, integration, e2e staging)

### ðŸ“‹ Step 3: PLAN REMEDIATION (PENDING)  
- [ ] Plan consolidation of multiple execution engine factories
- [ ] Design single UserExecutionEngine factory approach
- [ ] Map migration path from current state to SSOT

### ðŸ“‹ Step 4: EXECUTE REMEDIATION (PENDING)
- [ ] Implement consolidated execution engine factory
- [ ] Update all agent execution paths
- [ ] Ensure Golden Path functionality preserved

### ðŸ“‹ Step 5: TEST FIX LOOP (PENDING)
- [ ] Validate all existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] Verify new SSOT tests pass
- [ ] Confirm Golden Path user flow works end-to-end

### ðŸ“‹ Step 6: PR AND CLOSURE (PENDING)
- [ ] Create PR with SSOT consolidation
- [ ] Cross-link issue for auto-closure
- [ ] Validate Golden Path in staging

## Discovered SSOT Violations

### 1. ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Multiple Execution Engine Factories
- **Impact:** Blocks AI response delivery
- **Files Affected:** Multiple execution engine implementations
- **Golden Path Risk:** Users cannot get AI responses
- **Resolution:** Consolidate to single UserExecutionEngine factory

### 2. ðŸ”´ HIGH: Duplicate Agent Registries  
- **Impact:** Prevents agent discovery
- **Secondary Priority:** Address after execution engine fix

### 3. ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: Supervisor Implementation Sprawl
- **Impact:** Workflow inconsistencies
- **Future Enhancement:** Consider for subsequent SSOT cycles

### 4. ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: WebSocket Integration Duplicates
- **Impact:** Missing user notifications
- **Related:** May be resolved by execution engine fix

## Business Value Protection
- **$500K+ ARR at risk** due to broken AI response delivery
- **90% of platform value** depends on reliable agent execution
- **Golden Path user flow** must work: Login â†’ Agent execution â†’ AI responses

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Single consolidated execution engine factory
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Golden Path user flow fully operational
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Zero regression in AI response delivery
