## üîç Five Whys Root Cause Analysis - Circuit Breaker Import Failures

### Root Cause Analysis

**CircuitBreakerState Import Failure:**

**WHY 1:** `CircuitBreakerState` is not exported from circuit_breaker package
- **Evidence:** `__all__` only includes: `CircuitBreakerManager`, `CircuitBreaker`, `CircuitBreakerConfig`, `ServiceHealthMonitor`, `FailureDetector`

**WHY 2:** Class was renamed to `UnifiedCircuitBreakerState` during SSOT consolidation
- **Evidence:** Underlying module has `UnifiedCircuitBreakerState`, not `CircuitBreakerState`

**WHY 3:** SSOT consolidation changed class names but didn't update dependent imports or add aliases
- **Evidence:** No backward compatibility alias in `__init__.py`

**WHY 4:** Test code written against old API was not updated during SSOT migration

**WHY 5:** Migration process lacks comprehensive backward compatibility strategy
- **Root Cause:** SSOT improvements focus on consolidation without maintaining API stability

**CircuitOpenException Import Failure:**

**WHY 1:** `CircuitOpenException` class doesn't exist in the circuit breaker package
- **Evidence:** Not found in any circuit breaker module

**WHY 2:** Exception class was either never implemented or removed during SSOT consolidation
- **Evidence:** Circuit breaker uses state-based error handling, not exception-based

### Solutions Identified

**For CircuitBreakerState:**
```python
# CORRECT import:
from netra_backend.app.core.resilience.unified_circuit_breaker import UnifiedCircuitBreakerState
```

**For CircuitOpenException:**
- Class doesn't exist - tests need to be updated to use state-based error handling
- Or add missing exception class if required by business logic

**For docker_circuit_breaker module:**
- Module doesn't exist - needs to be created or test updated to use existing modules

### Files Requiring Updates
1. `tests/mission_critical/test_agent_resilience_patterns.py`
2. `tests/mission_critical/test_circuit_breaker_comprehensive.py`
3. `tests/mission_critical/test_docker_rate_limiter_integration.py`

### Systemic Issue
Same pattern as WebSocket issue - SSOT consolidation broke dependent code without systematic validation.

**Next Action:** Update imports to use correct SSOT paths and validate circuit breaker functionality.
