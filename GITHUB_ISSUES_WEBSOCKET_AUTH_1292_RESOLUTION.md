## Issue #1293: Implement WebSocket Ticket Generation Infrastructure

**Title:** Implement WebSocket ticket-based authentication infrastructure

**Labels:** `authentication`, `websocket`, `backend`, `P0-critical`, `epic-websocket-auth`

**Body:**
```markdown
## Summary

Implement the core ticket generation infrastructure required for WebSocket authentication. This addresses the fundamental browser limitation where Authorization headers cannot be included in WebSocket upgrade requests.

## Background

Issue #1292 identified that browser WebSocket protocol prevents Authorization headers during connection upgrade (RFC 6455). The current system has 6 competing authentication pathways that create confusion and silent failures. This issue implements the industry-standard ticket-based authentication solution.

**Root Cause:** Attempting to force HTTP authentication patterns onto WebSocket protocol constraints.

## Implementation Details

### Ticket Generation Endpoint
- **Endpoint:** `POST /websocket/ticket`
- **Authentication:** Requires valid JWT Authorization header
- **Response:** Returns short-lived ticket (30 seconds TTL)
- **Storage:** Redis-based with automatic expiration

### Ticket Properties
- **Format:** Cryptographically secure random string (32 characters)
- **TTL:** 30 seconds (configurable per environment)
- **Single-use:** Consumed on first WebSocket connection attempt
- **Scope:** Tied to specific user and session context

### Security Features
- Short TTL prevents replay attacks
- Single-use consumption prevents ticket reuse
- Secure random generation (cryptographically safe)
- Full audit logging of ticket lifecycle events

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] POST /websocket/ticket endpoint accepts JWT Authorization header
- [ ] Endpoint validates JWT token with auth service
- [ ] Generates cryptographically secure 32-character ticket
- [ ] Stores ticket in Redis with 30-second TTL
- [ ] Returns ticket in JSON response with expiration time
- [ ] All operations logged at INFO level with ticket lifecycle
- [ ] Invalid JWT returns HTTP 401 with clear error message
- [ ] Auth service unavailable returns HTTP 503 with circuit breaker

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- Redis connection for ticket storage
- Auth service integration for JWT validation
- FastAPI endpoint with proper error handling
- Comprehensive logging with structured format

### Configuration
- Configurable ticket TTL per environment (dev: 60s, staging: 30s, prod: 30s)
- Redis connection string and timeout settings
- Auth service endpoint configuration
- Rate limiting for ticket generation (per user)

### Testing
- Unit tests for ticket generation logic
- Integration tests with Redis storage
- E2E tests with auth service validation
- Load testing for ticket generation performance

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Endpoint functional and tested
- [ ] Redis integration working with TTL
- [ ] Auth service integration complete
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling implemented
- [ ] All tests passing (unit + integration + E2E)
- [ ] Performance acceptable under load (>1000 tickets/minute)
- [ ] Logging and monitoring instrumented
- [ ] Documentation updated with API specification

## Related Issues

- Parent: #1292 - Tangled auth websockets agents integration confusion
- Follows: #1294 - WebSocket ticket authentication implementation
- Blocks: #1295 - Frontend ticket-based authentication integration

## Business Value

**Segment:** Platform/Internal
**Goal:** Stability & SSOT Compliance
**Impact:** Foundation for eliminating 6 competing auth pathways, protecting $500K+ ARR chat functionality

## Issue #1294: Implement WebSocket Ticket Authentication

**Title:** Implement WebSocket connection authentication using tickets

**Labels:** `authentication`, `websocket`, `backend`, `P0-critical`, `epic-websocket-auth`

**Body:**
```markdown
## Summary

Implement WebSocket connection authentication using the ticket-based system. This replaces the current Authorization header approach with a protocol-compliant solution that works within browser WebSocket limitations.

## Background

Builds on #1293 ticket generation infrastructure. This issue implements the WebSocket side of ticket validation, allowing authenticated connections without violating WebSocket protocol constraints.

**Protocol Requirement:** WebSocket upgrade cannot include Authorization headers in browsers, requiring ticket in URL query parameters.

## Implementation Details

### WebSocket URL Format
```
wss://api.example.com/ws?ticket=<32-char-ticket>
```

### Authentication Flow
1. Client obtains ticket from POST /websocket/ticket (implemented in #1293)
2. Client connects to WebSocket with ticket as query parameter
3. WebSocket validates ticket (single-use consumption)
4. WebSocket exchanges ticket for full user context from auth service
5. Connection established with authenticated user context

### Ticket Validation Logic
- Extract ticket from WebSocket query parameters
- Validate ticket exists in Redis and not expired
- Consume ticket (delete from Redis to prevent reuse)
- Exchange ticket for user context via auth service
- Establish WebSocket connection with full user context

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] WebSocket accepts ticket query parameter during connection
- [ ] Invalid ticket results in HTTP 403 rejection during upgrade
- [ ] Expired ticket results in HTTP 401 rejection with clear error
- [ ] Valid ticket establishes full user context from auth service
- [ ] Ticket consumed on successful connection (single-use enforced)
- [ ] WebSocket events flow correctly post-authentication
- [ ] Connection rejection includes descriptive error message
- [ ] All authentication events logged at INFO level

## Technical Requirements

### Integration Points
- WebSocket SSOT manager (`websocket_ssot.py`)
- Redis for ticket validation and consumption
- Auth service for user context retrieval
- Existing WebSocket event system (5 critical events preserved)

### Error Handling
- **Invalid Ticket:** HTTP 403 with JSON error response
- **Expired Ticket:** HTTP 401 with JSON error response
- **Auth Service Down:** HTTP 503 with circuit breaker pattern
- **Redis Unavailable:** HTTP 503 with fallback logging

### Performance Requirements
- Ticket validation < 50ms p99
- No impact on existing WebSocket event latency
- Support concurrent ticket validations
- Graceful degradation under load

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Ticket extraction from query parameters
- Ticket validation logic with various scenarios
- Error handling for all failure modes
- User context establishment from auth service

### Integration Tests
- Full WebSocket connection flow with valid ticket
- Connection rejection with invalid/expired tickets
- Auth service integration for user context
- Redis integration for ticket consumption

### E2E Tests
- Complete authentication flow (ticket generation â†’ WebSocket connection)
- Frontend integration with ticket-based authentication
- Load testing with concurrent connections
- Security testing (replay attacks, invalid tickets)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] WebSocket connection accepts ticket query parameter
- [ ] Ticket validation and consumption working
- [ ] User context properly established from auth service
- [ ] All error scenarios handled with appropriate HTTP codes
- [ ] Integration with existing WebSocket manager complete
- [ ] 5 critical WebSocket events still functional
- [ ] All tests passing (unit + integration + E2E)
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Security validation complete

## Security Considerations

- Ticket transmitted over secure WebSocket (WSS) only
- Ticket consumption prevents replay attacks
- User context validation prevents privilege escalation
- All authentication events audited in logs
- Rate limiting on connection attempts per IP

## Related Issues

- Requires: #1293 - WebSocket ticket generation infrastructure
- Parent: #1292 - Tangled auth websockets agents integration confusion
- Follows: #1295 - Frontend ticket-based authentication integration
- Blocks: #1296 - Legacy authentication pathway removal

## Business Value

**Segment:** Platform/Internal
**Goal:** Stability & User Experience
**Impact:** Enables reliable WebSocket authentication, eliminating 15-20% failure rate and protecting chat functionality

## Issue #1295: Update Frontend WebSocket Authentication to Use Tickets

**Title:** Update frontend WebSocket authentication to use ticket-based flow

**Labels:** `frontend`, `authentication`, `websocket`, `P1-high`, `epic-websocket-auth`

**Body:**
```markdown
## Summary

Update frontend WebSocket connection logic to use the new ticket-based authentication flow instead of attempting to send Authorization headers (which don't work in browser WebSocket upgrades).

## Background

Current frontend attempts to authenticate WebSocket connections using Authorization headers, which are silently ignored by browsers during WebSocket upgrades (RFC 6455). This results in unauthenticated connections and authentication confusion.

**Browser Limitation:** WebSocket upgrade requests cannot include custom headers like Authorization in browser environments.

## Implementation Details

### Updated Authentication Flow
1. **Pre-Connection:** Request ticket from backend using existing JWT
2. **Connection:** Connect to WebSocket with ticket in URL query parameter
3. **Post-Connection:** Continue with existing WebSocket event handling

### Frontend Changes Required

#### WebSocket Service Updates
- Update `webSocketServiceResilient.ts` to request ticket before connection
- Modify connection URL to include ticket query parameter
- Update error handling for ticket-related failures
- Implement ticket refresh on JWT token updates

#### Authentication Integration
- Integrate ticket request with existing auth context
- Handle ticket generation failures gracefully
- Update authentication state management for WebSocket
- Coordinate JWT refresh with ticket regeneration

#### Error Handling
- Surface ticket generation errors to user
- Distinguish ticket errors from connection errors
- Implement retry logic for ticket generation failures
- Update connection status indicators

## Technical Requirements

### New API Calls
```typescript
// Request ticket before WebSocket connection
const response = await fetch('/websocket/ticket', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${jwtToken}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
const { ticket } = await response.json();
```

### Updated WebSocket Connection
```typescript
// Connect with ticket instead of Authorization header
const wsUrl = `${baseUrl}/ws?ticket=${ticket}`;
const ws = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
```

### Error Scenarios
- **Ticket Generation Fails:** Show auth error, trigger re-login
- **WebSocket Rejects Ticket:** Show connection error, retry with new ticket
- **JWT Refresh:** Generate new ticket automatically
- **Network Issues:** Distinguish ticket vs connection problems

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Frontend requests ticket before WebSocket connection
- [ ] WebSocket connection uses ticket query parameter (not Authorization header)
- [ ] Authentication errors properly surfaced to user with actionable messages
- [ ] JWT token refresh triggers automatic new ticket generation
- [ ] Connection retries generate fresh tickets (not reuse expired ones)
- [ ] Existing WebSocket event handling unchanged
- [ ] Authentication state management updated for ticket flow
- [ ] Error handling distinguishes ticket vs connection issues

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Ticket request logic with various JWT scenarios
- WebSocket connection logic with ticket parameter
- Error handling for all failure modes
- Authentication state management updates

### Integration Tests
- Full authentication flow (login â†’ ticket â†’ WebSocket)
- Token refresh scenarios with ticket regeneration
- Network failure scenarios and retry logic
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### E2E Tests
- Complete user journey: login â†’ chat â†’ AI response
- Authentication error scenarios with user recovery
- Performance testing with ticket generation latency
- Security testing (expired tickets, invalid tickets)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Frontend uses ticket-based WebSocket authentication
- [ ] No more Authorization header attempts for WebSocket
- [ ] All authentication errors surfaced with clear messages
- [ ] JWT refresh properly integrated with ticket generation
- [ ] All tests passing across supported browsers
- [ ] User experience improved (no silent auth failures)
- [ ] Performance acceptable (ticket generation < 500ms)
- [ ] Security requirements met (no sensitive data in URL)

## Security Considerations

- Ticket transmitted over HTTPS/WSS only
- Ticket in query parameter (acceptable for 30-second TTL)
- No logging of ticket values in frontend logs
- Automatic ticket cleanup on connection close
- Rate limiting on ticket generation requests

## User Experience Impact

### Positive Changes
- Eliminates silent authentication failures
- Provides clear error messages for auth issues
- Faster WebSocket connection (no header rejection retry)
- More reliable chat functionality

### Potential Concerns
- Additional API call before WebSocket connection (minimal latency)
- Ticket in URL query string (mitigated by short TTL and WSS)

## Related Issues

- Requires: #1293 - WebSocket ticket generation infrastructure
- Requires: #1294 - WebSocket ticket authentication implementation
- Parent: #1292 - Tangled auth websockets agents integration confusion
- Follows: #1296 - Legacy authentication pathway removal

## Business Value

**Segment:** Free/Early/Mid/Enterprise (All Users)
**Goal:** User Experience & Retention
**Impact:** Eliminates authentication confusion for users, improves chat reliability, protects revenue from auth-related churn
