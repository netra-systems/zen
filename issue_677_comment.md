## Issue #677 Audit - Performance SLA Critical Golden Path Failure

### Five Whys Analysis

**WHY #1: Why are all 3 performance runs failing?**
- The test `test_golden_path_performance_sla_staging` is trying to connect to staging WebSocket endpoints, but the connections are failing during the performance validation runs
- Error: `AssertionError: At least one performance run should succeed` - indicating 0/3 runs succeeded

**WHY #2: Why are the WebSocket connections failing during performance runs?**
- Looking at the test configuration, it's using staging URLs: `https://staging.netra.ai` (base), `wss://staging.netra.ai/ws` (WebSocket)
- However, the environment appears to be configured for local Docker testing, not staging infrastructure
- Docker services are not running locally, preventing fallback to local testing

**WHY #3: Why is there a mismatch between staging configuration and available infrastructure?**
- The test assumes staging environment availability (`wss://staging.netra.ai/ws`) but falls back to mock auth when real auth fails
- Environment variables like `STAGING_WEBSOCKET_URL` may not be properly configured
- The test has 20-second timeout for performance measurement, but connections may be timing out before establishing

**WHY #4: Why are the timeouts occurring during staging performance tests?**
- Network latency to staging environment may exceed the 20-second performance test timeout
- WebSocket handshake with staging infrastructure may be slower than local Docker services
- Authentication flow adds overhead that impacts performance baseline measurements

**WHY #5: Why is the performance baseline unrealistic for staging environment?**
- The test expects performance SLAs designed for local/optimized environments (≤5s first event, ≤45s execution)
- Staging infrastructure has inherent network overhead and cold start delays
- The test doesn't account for staging environment constraints vs production SLA requirements

### Current State Assessment

**✅ RESOLVED DEPENDENCIES:**
- Issue #420 (Docker Infrastructure) - strategically resolved via staging validation
- WebSocket infrastructure operational in staging environment

**❌ CURRENT ISSUES:**
1. **Environment Configuration**: Test configured for `staging.netra.ai` but may need actual staging URLs
2. **Performance Baselines**: SLA thresholds too aggressive for staging environment testing
3. **Timeout Configuration**: 20s performance timeout insufficient for staging network latency
4. **Docker Dependency**: Test execution requires Docker services that aren't running

### Technical Analysis

**Test File:** `tests/e2e/golden_path/test_complete_golden_path_e2e_staging.py`
**Method:** `test_golden_path_performance_sla_staging` (lines 575-701)

**Configuration Issues Identified:**
```python
# Current staging config (line 121-126)
self.staging_config = {
    "base_url": get_env().get("STAGING_BASE_URL", "https://staging.netra.ai"),
    "websocket_url": get_env().get("STAGING_WEBSOCKET_URL", "wss://staging.netra.ai/ws"),
    "api_url": get_env().get("STAGING_API_URL", "https://staging.netra.ai/api"),
    "auth_url": get_env().get("STAGING_AUTH_URL", "https://staging.netra.ai/auth")
}
```

**Performance Thresholds (lines 687-690):**
- Connection time: ≤5.0s (may be too aggressive for staging)
- First event latency: ≤10.0s (reasonable for staging)
- Execution time: ≤45.0s (reasonable for staging)

### Root Cause

The performance test is failing because it's designed to validate staging environment performance but:
1. **Environment Mismatch**: Configured for `staging.netra.ai` URLs that may not be accessible
2. **Docker Dependency**: Requires local Docker services for fallback testing
3. **Performance Expectations**: SLA thresholds may be too aggressive for staging network conditions

### Business Impact

- **Segment**: All (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
- **Revenue Risk**: Performance SLA validation blocked, preventing staging deployment confidence
- **Customer Impact**: Cannot validate system meets performance requirements protecting $500K+ ARR

### Recommended Resolution Priority

**P0 (Immediate):**
1. Verify staging environment URLs are accessible and correct
2. Adjust performance thresholds for staging environment realities
3. Fix Docker service dependency for local fallback testing

**P1 (Short-term):**
1. Implement graceful degradation for staging connectivity issues
2. Add performance monitoring baseline establishment for staging

**P2 (Medium-term):**
1. Separate local vs staging performance SLA requirements
2. Add staging environment health checks before performance testing

### Status

- **Related Issues**: Mentioned in Worklog #4 (E2E Golden Path Tests)
- **Cluster**: Part of golden path infrastructure testing suite
- **Priority**: P1 (High) - Performance SLA compliance critical for deployment confidence
