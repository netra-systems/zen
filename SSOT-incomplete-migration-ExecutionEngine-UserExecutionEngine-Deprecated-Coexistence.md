# SSOT-incomplete-migration-ExecutionEngine-UserExecutionEngine-Deprecated-Coexistence

**GitHub Issue:** [#565](https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/565)  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical/Blocking)  
**Status:** In Progress - Step 0 Complete  
**Created:** 2025-09-12  

## Issue Summary
Execution Engine SSOT fragmentation causing user isolation failures - deprecated and current implementations coexisting, causing global state contamination and agent execution failures.

## Progress Tracking

### âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Step 0.1**: SSOT Audit completed - violations identified
- [x] **Step 0.2**: GitHub Issue #565 created with P0 priority  
- [x] **IND**: Progress tracker created

### ðŸ”„ CURRENT STATUS
- Working on: Step 1 - Discover and Plan Test

### ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS  
- [ ] **Step 1**: Discover existing tests protecting agent execution functionality
- [ ] **Step 1**: Plan new SSOT tests for execution engine consolidation
- [ ] **Step 2**: Execute test plan for new SSOT tests
- [ ] **Step 3**: Plan SSOT remediation 
- [ ] **Step 4**: Execute SSOT remediation
- [ ] **Step 5**: Test fix loop until all tests pass
- [ ] **Step 6**: Create PR and close issue

## SSOT Violation Details

### Files Affected
- `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/execution_engine.py` (DEPRECATED - Lines 1-50)
- `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/user_execution_engine.py` (CURRENT SSOT)

### Evidence
```python
# VIOLATION: Deprecated execution engine still present with global state
# File: execution_engine.py (DEPRECATED)
"""
 ALERT:  CRITICAL SSOT MIGRATION - FILE DEPRECATED  ALERT: 

SECURITY FIX: Multiple ExecutionEngine implementations caused WebSocket user 
isolation vulnerabilities. UserExecutionEngine is now the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH.
"""

# File: user_execution_engine.py (CURRENT SSOT)
"""UserExecutionEngine for per-user isolated agent execution.
Key Design Principles:
- Complete per-user state isolation (no shared state between users)
- User-specific resource limits and concurrency control
"""
```

### Security/Business Impact
- **Revenue Risk:** $500K+ ARR from agent execution failures
- **Security Risk:** User data contamination between concurrent sessions
- **System Impact:** Agent execution failures preventing AI response generation
- **Memory Impact:** Memory leaks from non-isolated execution engines

### Expected Resolution
1. Remove deprecated `execution_engine.py` entirely
2. Enforce `UserExecutionEngine` as single source of truth
3. Update all imports to use UserExecutionEngine only
4. Validate user isolation works correctly
5. Test Golden Path agent execution flow
