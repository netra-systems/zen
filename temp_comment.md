## Issue Analysis - Health Endpoints 404 Staging Investigation

### Current Analysis Status ✅ COMPLETED

**Five Whys Root Cause Analysis:**

1. **Why are health endpoints returning 404?** The endpoints `/health` and `/api/health` are not responding in GCP staging
2. **Why are the endpoints not responding?** Need to verify if routes are properly registered in the FastAPI app
3. **Why might routes not be registered?** Could be deployment config issue or route import/registration failure
4. **Why would route registration fail?** Missing module imports or configuration drift during deployment
5. **Why would imports/config drift?** Environment-specific differences or incomplete deployment

### Code Audit Results 🔍

**Health Endpoint Implementation Status:**
- ✅ **`/health` endpoint exists** in `netra_backend/app/routes/health.py` (lines 56-200)
- ✅ **`/api/health` endpoint exists** in `netra_backend/app/routes/health_check.py` (lines 405-411)
- ✅ **Route configurations present** in `app_factory_route_configs.py`:
  - Line 26: `/api/health` mapped to health_check_router
  - Line 94: `/health` mapped to health.router
- ✅ **Route imports configured** in `app_factory_route_imports.py`:
  - Line 19: health module imported 
  - Line 86: health_check_router imported

### Route Registration Pattern ✅ VERIFIED

The app factory uses this pattern:
```python
# app_factory.py line 149
app.include_router(router, prefix=prefix, tags=tags)
```

**Expected Route Mappings:**
- `/health` → `health.router` (basic health checks)
- `/api/health` → `health_check_router` (comprehensive database health)

### Next Steps 📋

1. **Create staging test** to reproduce the 404 issue
2. **Verify route registration** in actual deployed app
3. **Check deployment logs** for route import failures
4. **Implement fix** if registration issue found

### Hypothesis 🔬

Most likely causes (in order of probability):
1. **Route import failure** during deployment (missing dependencies)
2. **Environment-specific config** preventing route registration
3. **Middleware interference** blocking health endpoint access
4. **Deployment artifact issue** (incomplete file deployment)

**Risk Level:** P2 - Affects monitoring but not core chat functionality
