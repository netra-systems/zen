# WebSocket Manager SSOT Remediation Master Plan

**Date:** 2025-09-16
**Issue:** #960 - SSOT WebSocket Manager Fragmentation Crisis
**Status:** Executive Master Plan for Complete Resolution

## Executive Summary

Issue #960 has become contaminated with infrastructure noise and scope creep, making it impossible to execute cleanly. The core problem remains valid: **11 duplicate WebSocket Manager implementations** violating SSOT principles and creating reliability risks for chat functionality (90% of platform value).

**Solution:** Close #960 and replace with focused, atomic issues that address the specific problems without confusion.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Real Problem
- **Architecture Violation:** 11 duplicate WebSocket Manager implementations
- **SSOT Violation:** No canonical source of truth for WebSocket management
- **Business Risk:** Chat functionality instability affects 90% of platform value
- **Maintenance Burden:** Changes require updates across multiple implementations

### Why Previous Attempts Failed
1. **Scope Creep:** Mixed architectural refactoring with infrastructure monitoring
2. **No Clear Ownership:** No decision on which implementation is canonical
3. **Contaminated Issue:** Infrastructure alerts and automated issues created noise
4. **Missing Success Criteria:** No clear definition of "done"
5. **Testing Gaps:** No validation strategy for SSOT compliance
