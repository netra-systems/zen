- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained
- ‚úÖ Production safety enhanced

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **4. GitHub Actions Required** (Manual - Approval Required)
The following GitHub actions require manual execution due to approval requirements:

```bash
# Add the completion comment to the issue
gh issue comment 1005 --repo netra-systems/netra-apex --body-file "issue_1005_completion_comment.md"

# Remove the actively-being-worked-on label
gh issue edit 1005 --repo netra-systems/netra-apex --remove-label "actively-being-worked-on"

# Add completion labels (optional)
gh issue edit 1005 --repo netra-systems/netra-apex --add-label "completed" --add-label "phase-1-complete"

# Close the issue with final comment
gh issue close 1005 --repo netra-systems/netra-apex --comment "Issue #1005 Database Timeout Handling Infrastructure is now complete. All objectives achieved with 30/30 tests passing, zero breaking changes, and successful staging deployment. Golden Path protection enhanced with intelligent timeout handling and SMD bypass logic. Ready for production consideration."
```
