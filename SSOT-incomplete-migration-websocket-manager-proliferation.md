# SSOT-incomplete-migration-websocket-manager-proliferation

**Issue:** #1023 - https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/1023
**Priority:** P0 - Golden Path Critical
**Status:** Created - Discovery Phase
**Created:** 2025-01-14

## Problem Summary

**CRITICAL SSOT VIOLATION**: WebSocket Manager Proliferation blocking Golden Path (users login → get AI responses)

### Key Findings
- **15+ WebSocket Manager Files** with competing implementations
- **$500K+ ARR Dependency** on reliable WebSocket events for AI chat
- **Race Conditions** in WebSocket initialization preventing reliable connections
- **Import Confusion** causing developer productivity issues

### Business Impact
- **Golden Path BLOCKED**: Users cannot reliably complete login → AI response flow
- **Revenue Risk**: $500K+ ARR depends on chat functionality working
- **Customer Experience**: Silent failures in AI interactions
- **Development Velocity**: Team slowed by inconsistent patterns

## Technical Analysis

### Current State
- Multiple manager files claiming SSOT authority:
  - `unified_manager.py`
  - `websocket_manager.py`
  - `manager.py`
- 20+ test files with inconsistent manager imports
- Race conditions during WebSocket connection establishment
- Silent failures masking critical business logic failures

### Root Cause
Incomplete migration to SSOT patterns left multiple WebSocket managers in production codebase, creating:
1. **Import Ambiguity**: Developers unsure which manager to use
2. **Initialization Races**: Multiple managers competing for resources
3. **Test Instability**: Inconsistent mocking and setup patterns
4. **Silent Failures**: No clear error reporting when wrong manager used

## Remediation Strategy

### Phase 1: Discovery and Planning ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Audit WebSocket manager proliferation
- [x] Create GitHub issue #1023
- [x] Establish tracking documentation

### Phase 2: Test Discovery and Planning
- [ ] Find existing tests protecting WebSocket functionality
- [ ] Plan new SSOT validation tests
- [ ] Design failing tests to reproduce SSOT violations

### Phase 3: SSOT Remediation Planning
- [ ] Design canonical WebSocket manager architecture
- [ ] Plan migration strategy with backward compatibility
- [ ] Define success criteria and rollback procedures

### Phase 4: Implementation and Validation
- [ ] Implement SSOT WebSocket manager consolidation
- [ ] Migrate all imports to canonical source
- [ ] Validate Golden Path functionality restored

## Success Criteria

### Business Success
- [ ] Golden Path works: Users login → get AI responses
- [ ] WebSocket events reliably delivered for AI chat
- [ ] Zero regression in $500K+ ARR functionality

### Technical Success
- [ ] Single canonical WebSocket manager (SSOT)
- [ ] All imports reference single authoritative source
- [ ] Test suite uses consistent manager patterns
- [ ] Race conditions eliminated

## Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK AREAS**:
- WebSocket connection stability during migration
- Backward compatibility for existing integrations
- Test suite stability during manager consolidation

**MITIGATION STRATEGIES**:
- Incremental migration with feature flags
- Comprehensive test coverage before changes
- Rollback procedures for each phase

## Progress Log

### 2025-01-14 - Issue Creation
- ✅ Discovered 15+ competing WebSocket managers
- ✅ Created GitHub issue #1023
- ✅ Established P0 priority for Golden Path blocking
- ✅ Documented $500K+ ARR business impact

### Next Actions
1. **STEP 1**: Discover existing tests (spawn subagent)
2. **STEP 2**: Plan new SSOT validation tests (spawn subagent)
3. **STEP 3**: Design SSOT remediation strategy (spawn subagent)
