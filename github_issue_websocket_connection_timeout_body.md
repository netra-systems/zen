## Impact
**Business Impact:** Complete failure of real-time chat functionality affecting $500K+ ARR. WebSocket infrastructure down with 0% connection success rate.

**Revenue Risk:** HIGH - Core chat and real-time collaboration features completely broken.

## Current Behavior
- WebSocket connection timeouts during handshake phase
- TimeoutError during opening handshake at wss://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/ws
- 1011 Internal Errors preventing protocol establishment
- 0% connection success rate across all WebSocket tests

## Expected Behavior
- WebSocket connections should establish successfully during handshake
- Real-time chat functionality should be operational
- Agent communication pipeline should handle message delivery
- Event broadcasting system should be functional

## Reproduction Steps
1. Deploy backend service to staging environment
2. Attempt WebSocket connection to wss://api.staging.netrasystems.ai/ws
3. Observe timeout during opening handshake
4. Check for 1011 Internal Errors in connection logs
