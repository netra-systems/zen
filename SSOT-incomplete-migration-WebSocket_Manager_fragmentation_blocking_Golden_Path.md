# SSOT-incomplete-migration-WebSocket Manager fragmentation blocking Golden Path

**Issue:** #1055
**GitHub Link:** https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/1055
**Status:** üîç DISCOVERY PHASE
**Priority:** P0 - Critical Golden Path Blocker

## Executive Summary
WebSocket Manager fragmentation creating race conditions and inconsistent behavior blocking the Golden Path user flow (login ‚Üí AI responses). Multiple competing implementations violate SSOT principles and threaten $500K+ ARR business value.

## SSOT Violations Discovered
1. **WebSocket Manager Duplication**: Multiple initialization patterns across websocket_core/
2. **Inconsistent Event Handling**: Competing implementations for agent events
3. **Factory Pattern Violations**: Mixed singleton/factory patterns causing state conflicts

## Files Requiring SSOT Consolidation
- `netra_backend/app/websocket_core/websocket_manager.py`
- Related WebSocket initialization files
- WebSocket event handlers and factories

## Work Progress

### ‚úÖ STEP 0: DISCOVER NEXT SSOT ISSUE (SSOT AUDIT)
- [x] SSOT audit completed via specialized agent
- [x] Top 3 critical violations identified
- [x] GitHub issue #1055 created
- [x] Local progress tracker (IND) created

### ‚úÖ STEP 1: DISCOVER AND PLAN TEST (COMPLETED)
- [x] 1.1) DISCOVER EXISTING: Find collection of existing tests
- [x] 1.2) PLAN ONLY: Plan for test updates and new test creation

#### 1.1) EXISTING TESTS DISCOVERED
**COMPREHENSIVE TEST COVERAGE:** 2888+ files contain websocket/WebSocket references!

**KEY EXISTING SSOT TESTS (ALREADY DESIGNED TO FAIL/PASS):**
- `tests/unit/websocket_core/test_ssot_websocket_manager_single_instance.py` - Tests single manager instance
- `tests/unit/websocket_core/test_ssot_import_pattern_compliance.py` - Tests import standardization
- `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py` - Protects $500K+ ARR Golden Path

**CRITICAL MISSION TESTS TO PROTECT:**
- WebSocket agent event delivery (Golden Path core)
- WebSocket authentication flows
- Multi-user WebSocket isolation
- WebSocket manager lifecycle tests

#### 1.2) TEST PLAN
**EXISTING TEST UPDATES (60% - HIGH VALUE):**
- Mission critical tests MUST continue passing during SSOT refactor
- SSOT validation tests should PASS after consolidation (currently failing as designed)
- WebSocket authentication tests need SSOT import updates

**NEW SSOT TESTS (20% - TARGETED):**
- Import path consistency validation tests
- Factory pattern consolidation validation
- Race condition reproduction tests (currently failing)

**VALIDATION TESTS (20% - SAFETY):**
- Golden Path functionality preserved during SSOT changes
- No new breaking changes introduced
- Performance impact assessment

### ‚è≥ REMAINING STEPS
- [ ] STEP 2: EXECUTE THE TEST PLAN
- [ ] STEP 3: PLAN REMEDIATION OF SSOT
- [ ] STEP 4: EXECUTE THE REMEDIATION SSOT PLAN
- [ ] STEP 5: ENTER TEST FIX LOOP
- [ ] STEP 6: PR AND CLOSURE

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Single WebSocket manager implementation (SSOT)
- [ ] Consistent initialization patterns
- [ ] All Golden Path tests passing
- [ ] WebSocket events working reliably

## Business Impact
**PROTECTED:** $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality
**RISK:** WebSocket communication failures blocking core chat functionality
