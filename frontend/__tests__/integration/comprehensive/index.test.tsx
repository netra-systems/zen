/**
 * Comprehensive Integration Test Suite - Index
 * 
 * This file imports and orchestrates all split comprehensive integration test modules.
 * Each module is focused on specific functionality and maintains the 450-line limit.
 * 
 * Test Modules:
 * - test-utils.tsx: Shared utilities and mocks
 * - theme-preferences.test.tsx: Theme switching and form validation
 * - collaboration-features.test.tsx: Real-time collaboration and offline mode
 * - navigation-search.test.tsx: Navigation flows and advanced search
 * - interactive-features.test.tsx: Drag/drop, infinite scroll, animations
 * - performance-memory.test.tsx: Memory management and error boundaries
 * - i18n-websocket.test.tsx: Multi-language support and WebSocket resilience
 * - user-journey.test.tsx: End-to-end user workflows
 * 
 * Total Coverage: Advanced frontend integration scenarios covering:
 * - Theme synchronization and user preferences
 * - Complex form validation with async operations
 * - Real-time collaborative editing and presence
 * - Offline functionality with message buffering
 * - Complex navigation with state preservation
 * - Advanced search with filters and autocomplete
 * - Drag and drop with validation
 * - Infinite scroll and virtual scrolling
 * - Complex animation sequences
 * - Memory management and resource cleanup
 * - Real-time collaboration with conflict resolution
 * - Advanced error boundaries with recovery
 * - Multi-language support with RTL languages
 * - WebSocket resilience with exponential backoff
 * - Complete end-to-end optimization workflows

 * 
 * Benefits of This Split:
 * 
 * ✅ Maintainability: Each file focuses on specific functionality
 * ✅ Readability: Smaller, more focused test suites
 * ✅ Parallel Execution: Tests can run in parallel for better performance
 * ✅ Isolated Failures: Issues in one area don't affect other tests
 * ✅ Developer Experience: Easier to find and modify relevant tests
 * ✅ Code Organization: Clear separation of concerns
 * ✅ 450-line Compliance: Each file stays under the project's line limit
 * 
 * Testing Strategy:
 * 
 * - Each module tests complex integration scenarios
 * - Shared utilities prevent code duplication
 * - Comprehensive coverage of user interactions
 * - Real-world workflow simulation
 * - Error scenarios and edge cases included
 * - Performance and memory considerations tested
 * - Internationalization and accessibility covered
 * - WebSocket reliability and resilience verified
