# React act() Warning Fixes

## Problem
The frontend integration tests were showing React act() warnings:
```
An update to TestComponent inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).
```

This occurred specifically when WebSocket event handlers (`onopen`, `onmessage`, `onclose`, `onerror`) were triggering React state updates outside of the testing library's act() wrapper.

## Solution
Created a helper utility `createActWrapper` in `__tests__/integration/helpers/websocket-helpers.ts` that properly wraps WebSocket event handlers with React's `act()` function.

### Files Fixed
- `__tests__/integration/basic-integration-data.test.tsx` - Updated all WebSocket handlers to use the new wrapper
- `__tests__/integration/helpers/websocket-helpers.ts` - Added `createActWrapper` utility

### Usage Pattern
**Before (causing act warnings):**
```typescript
ws.onopen = () => setConnected(true);
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  setMessage(data.content);
};
```

**After (no warnings):**
```typescript
ws.onopen = createActWrapper(() => setConnected(true));
ws.onmessage = createActWrapper((event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  setMessage(data.content);
});
```

## Result
- ✅ React act() warnings eliminated
- ✅ Tests run cleanly without state update warnings  
- ✅ Reusable helper available for future WebSocket tests
- ✅ Proper documentation added for other developers

## Next Steps
Use the `createActWrapper` utility whenever creating new tests with:
- WebSocket event handlers that update React state
- Timer callbacks that update state
- Promise resolutions that update state
- Any async operations that trigger React state changes in tests
