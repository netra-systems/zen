# ThreadService.getThread Mock Fix Summary

## Problem
The MessageInput component tests were failing with the error:
```
TypeError: _threadService.ThreadService.getThread is not a function
at frontend/components/chat/MessageInput.tsx:146
```

## Root Cause
The MessageInput component calls `ThreadService.getThread(threadId)` on line 107, but the test mock in `thread-management.test.tsx` only used:
```javascript
jest.mock('@/services/threadService');
```

This creates an empty mock object without any methods, causing `getThread` to be undefined.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed thread-management.test.tsx
- Added complete ThreadService mock with all required methods including `getThread`
- Added ThreadRenameService mock since MessageInput uses it
- Fixed store mocks to use `useUnifiedChatStore` instead of `useChatStore`
- Updated WebSocket payload structure to use `content` instead of `text`

### 2. Fixed ui-improvements.test.tsx
- Added missing `getThread` method to ThreadService mock
- Added complete ThreadService interface with all methods
- Added ThreadRenameService mock

### 3. Created shared-mocks.ts
- Centralized mock setup for MessageInput component tests
- Provides consistent mocking across all MessageInput test files
- Includes helper functions for overriding specific mock values

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/__tests__/components/chat/MessageInput/thread-management.test.tsx`
2. `frontend/__tests__/chat/ui-improvements.test.tsx`
3. `frontend/__tests__/components/chat/MessageInput/shared-mocks.ts` (new)
4. `frontend/__tests__/components/chat/MessageInput/threadservice-fix-test.tsx` (new test)

## ThreadService Mock Structure
The complete mock now includes:
- `listThreads()` - Returns empty array
- `createThread()` - Returns mock thread object
- `getThread()` - **CRITICAL FIX** - Returns mock thread object
- `deleteThread()` - Returns void
- `updateThread()` - Returns updated thread object
- `getThreadMessages()` - Returns mock messages response

## Verification
- Created a simple test to verify `ThreadService.getThread` is properly mocked
- Updated all existing tests to use consistent mock structure
- Fixed store mocking to match actual MessageInput dependencies

## Prevention
- Use the shared-mocks.ts file for future MessageInput tests
- Always include complete interface when mocking services
- Check that all methods used by the component are included in mocks
