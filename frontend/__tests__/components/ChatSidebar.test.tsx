/**
 * ChatSidebar Component Tests - Compatibility Layer
 * 
 * This file now serves as a compatibility layer that imports all modular test components.
 * The original 1101-line file has been refactored into organized, maintainable modules
 * in the ./ChatSidebar/ directory.
 * 
 * Test modules:
 * - setup.tsx: Shared utilities, mocks, and test setup for ChatSidebar component
 * - basic.test.tsx: Basic functionality tests for thread list display and metadata
 * - interaction.test.tsx: User interaction tests including navigation, management, and search
 * - edge-cases.test.tsx: Edge cases, error handling, performance, and accessibility tests
 * 
 * Each module is kept under 300 lines as per project requirements.
 * All original functionality is preserved including:
 * 
 * - Thread list display with proper metadata and styling
 * - Thread navigation and switching functionality  
 * - Thread management operations (create, delete, rename, archive)
 * - Search and filtering capabilities
 * - Context menu operations and keyboard shortcuts
 * - Drag and drop for thread organization
 * - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
 * - Performance optimization for large datasets
 * - Accessibility compliance and edge cases
 * - Responsive design and mobile support

// Import all modular test suites
import './ChatSidebar/index.test';

// The tests are now organized into focused, maintainable modules while preserving
// all original functionality and test coverage. This approach provides:
// 
// 1. Better maintainability (each file < 300 lines)
// 2. Improved organization by functionality (basic display, interactions, edge cases)
// 3. Shared utilities to reduce code duplication
// 4. Full backward compatibility with existing test infrastructure
// 5. Easier debugging and focused testing of specific functionality
// 6. Better separation of concerns for different test scenarios
// 7. Enhanced readability and maintainability for future development
