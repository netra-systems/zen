/**
 * ThreadState Namespace Collision Reproduction Test
 * 
 * Purpose: Demonstrate the namespace collision between:
 * 1. ThreadState interface (thread data) from store/slices/types.ts
 * 2. ThreadOperationState type (operation states) from lib/thread-state-machine.ts
 * 
 * This test should FAIL initially, demonstrating the SSOT violation.
 * After remediation, it should PASS with clear semantic distinction.
 * 
 * Issue: #879 - SSOT ThreadState migration
