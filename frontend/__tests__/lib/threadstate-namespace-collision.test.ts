/**
 * ThreadState Namespace Collision Reproduction Test
 * 
 * Purpose: Demonstrate the RESOLVED namespace collision between:
 * 1. ThreadSliceState interface (thread data) from store/slices/types.ts
 * 2. ThreadOperationState type (operation states) from lib/thread-state-machine.ts
 * 
 * After remediation, this test validates that namespace collision is RESOLVED
 * and demonstrates clear semantic distinction between thread data and operation states.
 * 
 * Issue: #879 - SSOT ThreadState migration
