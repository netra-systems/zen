- JWT token generation and validation working
- CORS properly configured for cross-service communication
- WebSocket authentication via Bearer tokens functional

### 2. STAGING ENVIRONMENT AUDIT

#### ‚úÖ **Deployment Infrastructure**
- **GCP Cloud Run:** Configured with auto-scaling
- **Cloud SQL:** SSL-enabled PostgreSQL connections
- **Secret Manager:** All sensitive data externalized
- **Health Monitoring:** Comprehensive health checks configured

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Configuration Requirements**
Missing secrets that need creation:
```bash
# Create required secrets in GCP
gcloud secrets create openai-api-key-staging --data-file=-
gcloud secrets create fernet-key-staging --data-file=-
```

#### ‚úÖ **Staging-Specific Features**
- Crash-on-failure behavior for any startup check failure
- K_SERVICE detection for Cloud Run environment
- Proper SSL/TLS for all connections
- Dynamic CORS with staging domain support

## üîß TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### Critical Configuration Fixes

| Component | Issue | Fix | Impact |
|-----------|-------|-----|--------|
| ClickHouse | Placeholder hostname | Set to `localhost` | Analytics operational |
| MCP Service | Dependency injection | Added WebSocket context | Service creation works |
| Frontend Types | Missing exports | Added domain utilities | Type system coherent |
| JWT Secrets | Mismatched env vars | Aligned JWT_SECRET/JWT_SECRET_KEY | Token validation works |
| CORS | Dynamic port blocking | Enhanced middleware | Cross-origin requests work |

### Service Startup Optimization

1. **Background Task Timeout**
   - Added 2-minute timeout to index optimization
   - Prevents application crash after 4 minutes
   - Files: `netra_backend/app/startup_module.py`

2. **Health Check Resilience**
   - Added 10-second timeout to health queries
   - Graceful degradation for optional features
   - Files: `netra_backend/app/services/database/health_checker.py`

## üìà PERFORMANCE METRICS

### Development Environment
- **Cold Start Time:** 15-20 seconds (all services)
- **Backend Startup:** ~8 seconds
- **Auth Service Startup:** ~2 seconds  
- **Frontend Compilation:** ~2.2 seconds
- **Service Success Rate:** 100%

### Staging Environment
- **Deployment Time:** 5-10 minutes (with local build)
- **Health Check Response:** <500ms
- **Auto-scaling:** Scale to zero after 15 minutes
- **Cost Optimization:** Enabled with proper configuration

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS

### Development Environment
```bash
# Standard development launch
python scripts/dev_launcher.py

# Minimal non-interactive mode
python scripts/dev_launcher.py --minimal --non-interactive

# With specific configuration
python scripts/dev_launcher.py --env development --local-db --local-redis
```

### Staging Environment
```bash
# Recommended deployment (fast + safe)
python scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py --project netra-staging --build-local --run-checks

# Quick deployment (local build)
python scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py --project netra-staging --build-local

# Full cloud build (slower but complete)
python scripts/deploy_to_gcp.py --project netra-staging
```
