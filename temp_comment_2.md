## Issue #598 CONFIRMED ✅ - Health Endpoints 404 in Staging

### Test Results 🧪 ISSUE REPRODUCED

**Test Status:** ✅ **ISSUE CONFIRMED** - All health endpoints returning 404 in GCP staging

**Test Execution:**
```bash
python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_issue_598_health_endpoints_simple.py -v -s
```

**Results:**
- ❌ `/health` → 404 Page not found
- ❌ `/api/health` → 404 Page not found  
- ❌ `/health/ready` → 404 Page not found
- ❌ `/health/live` → 404 Page not found
- ❌ `/health/startup` → 404 Page not found

**Evidence:**
- All endpoints return HTML 404 page: `<title>404 Page not found</title>`
- Response times: ~65-160ms (service is responsive, routes missing)
- Testing URL: `https://netra-backend-staging-service-672236085899.us-central1.run.app`

### Root Cause Analysis 🔍

**Confirmed Issue:** Health endpoint routes are **NOT REGISTERED** in the deployed GCP staging service.

**Analysis:**
1. ✅ **Health endpoint code exists** - Both `/health` and `/api/health` implementations found
2. ✅ **Route configurations exist** - Proper routing setup in app factory 
3. ✅ **Route imports configured** - Import statements present
4. ❌ **Routes not registered in deployment** - All health endpoints return 404

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- **Route import failure** during GCP deployment
- **Module dependency missing** preventing health module loading
- **Environment-specific import error** not caught locally

### Next Steps - Remediation Plan 🛠️

**Priority 1: Investigate Route Registration**
1. Check GCP deployment logs for import errors
2. Verify all health module dependencies are available in staging
3. Test route registration locally vs staging

**Priority 2: Implement Fix**
1. Fix any missing dependencies or import issues
2. Ensure health routes are properly registered in app factory
3. Add deployment validation to prevent regression

**Priority 3: Deploy & Validate**
1. Deploy fix to GCP staging
2. Re-run health endpoint test to confirm resolution
3. Add monitoring to prevent future occurrences

### Business Impact 📊

- **Monitoring Systems:** External health checks failing
- **Auto-scaling:** GCP health checks may affect container decisions
- **Operational Visibility:** No health endpoint availability for debugging
- **Customer Impact:** None (health endpoints are infrastructure-only)

**Risk Level:** P2 - Infrastructure monitoring impacted, no customer-facing issues

### Test Files Created 📁

- `tests/e2e/test_issue_598_health_endpoints_simple.py` - Reproduces issue
- Test confirms exact pattern from issue: `User-Agent: curl/7.81.0` → 404

**Next Action:** Investigate deployment logs and fix route registration issues
