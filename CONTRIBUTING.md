## Business Value Justification

### Required BVJ Template

**EVERY PR must include this in the description:**

```markdown
## Business Value Justification (BVJ)

**Customer Segment**: [Free/Early/Mid/Enterprise]
**Business Goal**: [Increase savings/conversion/retention]
**Value Impact**: [Estimated % improvement]
**Revenue Impact**: [Estimated MRR increase]
**Implementation Cost**: [Dev hours]
**ROI**: [Revenue Impact / Implementation Cost]

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Metric 1: [e.g., 10% reduction in API costs]
- [ ] Metric 2: [e.g., 5% increase in Free‚ÜíEarly conversion]
- [ ] Metric 3: [e.g., 15ms latency improvement]
```

### Example BVJ

```markdown
## Business Value Justification

**Customer Segment**: Mid-tier ($10K-100K monthly AI spend)
**Business Goal**: Increase savings through intelligent model routing
**Value Impact**: 15% additional cost reduction
**Revenue Impact**: +$45K MRR (15 customers √ó $3K savings √ó 20% fee)
**Implementation Cost**: 40 dev hours
**ROI**: 27:1 (first month)

### Success Metrics
- [ ] 15% cost reduction for text generation workloads
- [ ] <100ms routing decision latency
- [ ] 95% routing accuracy
```

## Code Standards

### üî¥ MANDATORY: 300/8 Rule

```python
# BEFORE EVERY COMMIT - NO EXCEPTIONS
python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py

# Must show:
# ‚úì All files ‚â§ 300 lines
# ‚úì All functions ‚â§ 8 lines
# ‚úì No violations found
```

### Module Design Requirements

1. **File Size**: Maximum 300 lines per file
2. **Function Size**: Maximum 8 lines per function
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each module does ONE thing
4. **Type Safety**: All parameters must have type hints
5. **No Duplicates**: Reuse existing code, extend don't duplicate

### Code Style

```python
# GOOD: 8-line function with clear purpose
def calculate_optimization_savings(
    original_cost: float,
    optimized_cost: float
) -> OptimizationResult:
    """Calculate customer savings and Netra revenue."""
    savings = original_cost - optimized_cost
    percentage = (savings / original_cost * 100) if original_cost else 0
    netra_fee = savings * 0.20  # 20% performance fee
    return OptimizationResult(
        savings=savings,
        percentage=percentage,
        fee=netra_fee
    )

# BAD: Function exceeds 8 lines
def process_optimization_request(request):
    # 15 lines of code...
    # VIOLATION: Split into smaller functions
```

## Development Process

### 1. Pre-Development Checklist

- [ ] Read `CLAUDE.md` for business requirements
- [ ] Check `SPEC/learnings/` for related issues
- [ ] Verify feature aligns with customer segment strategy
- [ ] Calculate expected ROI
- [ ] Plan module boundaries (300-line limit)

### 2. Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/revenue-optimization-routing

# 2. Check current compliance
python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py

# 3. Develop with continuous testing
python test_runner.py --level unit  # Run frequently

# 4. Verify compliance before commit
python scripts/check_architecture_compliance.py

# 5. Run comprehensive tests
python test_runner.py --level integration

# 6. Create PR with BVJ
```

### 3. Commit Message Format

```
