# Issue #973 - Complete Resolution Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ FINAL STATUS: RESOLVED âœ…

### Executive Summary
**Issue #973: WebSocket Event Structure Validation Failures** has been successfully resolved through comprehensive SSOT consolidation and import path corrections.

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Primary Issue:** Import errors from SSOT consolidation
- **Specific Cause:** Removal of `DataAnalysisResponse` class during consolidation
- **Impact:** Breaking changes across multiple modules
- **Detection:** Comprehensive codebase analysis using grep/search patterns

### Resolution Implementation

   - Fixed import paths in `/netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/execution_engine.py`
   - Updated import structure in `/netra_backend/app/tools/enhanced_dispatcher.py`
   - Resolved dependency issues across affected modules

2. **d9a4eb49e** - `docs(issue-1019): add comprehensive stability verification and wrap-up documentation`
   - Cross-issue documentation improvements

3. **7680a8a7c** - `docs(issue-973): add final validation report and deployment script`
   - Added `ISSUE_973_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
   - Created `deploy_issue_973_fix.sh` for staging verification

#### Files Created/Modified
- **Documentation:**
  - `/ISSUE_973_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` - Complete validation report
  - `/deploy_issue_973_fix.sh` - Staging deployment script
  - `/ISSUE_973_RESOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document
