# Issue #1117 - Agent Session Start Tracking

## ü§ñ Agent Session Initiated

**Issue**: #1117 - JWT Validation Scattered Across Services
**Session Start**: 2025-09-16
**Agent**: Claude Code SSOT Gardener
**Priority**: P0 - Critical Golden Path Blocker
**Estimated Duration**: 3-5 days

## üìã Session Objectives

### Primary Goal
Consolidate scattered JWT validation logic across services into Single Source of Truth (SSOT) to enable reliable user authentication in Golden Path flow.

### Business Impact
- **Golden Path**: Unblock user login step - critical for "users login ‚Üí AI responses" flow
- **Revenue Protection**: $500K+ ARR depends on authentication functionality
- **Customer Experience**: Enable users to access the platform and AI chat features

## üéØ Scope & Files

### Files in Scope (4 total)
1. `/auth_service/auth_core/core/jwt_handler.py:29` - **JWTHandler (SSOT)** ‚úÖ
2. `/auth_service/services/jwt_service.py:16` - **JWTService wrapper** ‚ö†Ô∏è
3. `/netra_backend/app/auth_integration/auth.py:117` - **validate_token_jwt() call** ‚ùå
4. `/netra_backend/app/websocket_core/unified_websocket_auth.py:1` - **WebSocket auth wrapper** ‚ùå

### Current Assessment
- **SSOT Established**: JWTHandler in auth_service is the canonical implementation
- **Violations**: Multiple services implementing JWT validation independently
- **Pattern**: Need to eliminate wrapper services and direct validation calls

## üìà Progress Tracker

### Step 0: Discovery ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] SSOT audit completed
- [x] GitHub issue #1117 created
- [x] Local tracking file created
- [x] Agent session initiated

### Step 1: Discover and Plan Tests üîÑ STARTING
- [ ] 1.1 Discover existing JWT validation tests
- [ ] 1.2 Plan SSOT validation tests for consolidation
- [ ] 1.3 Identify test coverage gaps

### Step 2: Execute Test Plan (NEXT)
- [ ] Create new SSOT tests for JWT validation
- [ ] Ensure test coverage for all JWT validation scenarios
- [ ] Validate tests pass with current scattered implementation

### Step 3: Plan Remediation
- [ ] Plan SSOT consolidation strategy
- [ ] Design elimination of wrapper classes
- [ ] Plan service communication updates

### Step 4: Execute Remediation
- [ ] Implement SSOT consolidation
- [ ] Remove duplicate validation pathways
- [ ] Update service integration points

### Step 5: Test Fix Loop
- [ ] Validate all tests pass
- [ ] Fix any breaking changes
- [ ] Ensure Golden Path functionality intact

### Step 6: PR and Closure
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Link to close issue
- [ ] Verify user authentication works end-to-end

## üîç Technical Strategy

### SSOT Consolidation Approach
1. **Preserve SSOT**: Keep JWTHandler as canonical implementation
2. **Eliminate Wrappers**: Remove JWTService and other wrapper classes
3. **Direct Integration**: Update services to call auth service directly
4. **Unified Interface**: Ensure consistent JWT validation across all services

### Risk Mitigation
- **Surgical Changes**: Focus on specific 4 files to minimize impact
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain existing interfaces where possible
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Validate all JWT scenarios still work
- **Rollback Plan**: Limited scope enables quick reversion if needed

## üìä Success Criteria

### Technical Objectives
- [ ] All JWT validation flows through single auth service endpoint
- [ ] Zero duplicate JWT validation implementations
- [ ] All wrapper classes eliminated or properly justified
- [ ] Service boundaries clearly maintained

### Business Objectives
- [ ] User login functionality fully operational
- [ ] Golden Path user flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Authentication latency acceptable (< 500ms)
- [ ] Zero customer-facing authentication failures

### Quality Objectives
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] New SSOT validation tests added
- [ ] Code complexity reduced through consolidation
- [ ] Architecture compliance improved

## üö® Golden Path Validation

**Critical**: This issue directly enables the Golden Path user flow:
1. **User Login** ‚Üê THIS ISSUE FIXES THIS STEP
2. AI Agent Processing
3. Response Delivery
4. Real-time Updates

**Business Justification**: Without working JWT validation, users cannot authenticate and access ANY platform functionality. This makes JWT consolidation the highest priority SSOT issue.

## üìù Session Notes

### Previous Work Context
- Issue #670: Previous JWT SSOT work may have missed violations found in 2025-09-14 audit
- Auth SSOT compliance per `reports/auth/BACKEND_AUTH_SSOT_AUDIT_20250107.md`
- Auth service MUST be the ONLY source for JWT operations

### Implementation Guidelines
- Follow surgical approach similar to successful Issue #596 remediation
- Maintain zero breaking changes philosophy
- Preserve all security and validation logic
- Focus on architectural consolidation without functional changes

**Agent Session Active**: Ready to begin Step 1 - Discover and Plan Tests
**Next Action**: Spawn sub-agent for JWT test discovery and SSOT validation planning
