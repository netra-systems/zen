# JWT Configuration Health Monitoring

## Problem
No proactive monitoring exists to detect JWT configuration inconsistencies across services, leading to silent failures that only surface during authentication attempts.

## Current Monitoring Gaps
Based on analysis of issue #930, several monitoring blind spots exist:

### Missing Monitoring:
- [ ] **Runtime JWT secret consistency validation**
- [ ] **Cross-service JWT configuration alignment**
- [ ] **Environment-specific secret availability**
- [ ] **JWT token generation/validation success rates**
- [ ] **Authentication failure root cause tracking**

### Silent Failure Scenarios:
- Environment variable loading failures
- JWT secret caching inconsistencies
- Multi-service race conditions during startup
- Configuration precedence conflicts
- Secret rotation coordination issues

## Solution: Comprehensive JWT Health Monitoring

### Phase 1: Configuration Health Checks
Implement runtime validation for:

1. **Secret Consistency Validation**
   ```python
   def validate_jwt_configuration_health():
       """Verify all services use consistent JWT secrets."""
       # Check JWT_SECRET_STAGING availability
       # Validate secret length and format
       # Verify cross-service secret alignment
       # Report configuration drift
   ```

2. **Startup Validation**
   - Verify JWT secrets loaded properly during service startup
   - Check environment variable precedence is correct
   - Validate GCP Secret Manager connectivity
   - Ensure all services can generate/validate tokens

3. **Runtime Health Monitoring**
   - Continuous validation of JWT configuration consistency
   - Detection of secret rotation events
   - Monitoring of authentication success/failure rates
   - Alert on JWT-related errors

### Phase 2: Proactive Alerting
- [ ] **Critical**: JWT secret unavailable or too short
- [ ] **Warning**: JWT configuration drift between services
- [ ] **Info**: JWT secret rotation detected
- [ ] **Error**: Authentication failure rate above threshold

### Phase 3: Monitoring Dashboard
Create monitoring dashboard showing:
- JWT configuration health status across all services
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Recent JWT-related errors and resolutions
- Secret rotation timeline and status

## Implementation Strategy

### Health Check Endpoints
Add JWT-specific health checks to existing `/health` endpoints:

```python
GET /health/jwt
{
    "status": "healthy|degraded|unhealthy",
    "details": {
        "jwt_secret_available": true,
        "secret_length_valid": true,
        "cross_service_consistency": true,
        "last_validated": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z"
    }
}
```

### Monitoring Integration
- Integrate with existing GCP monitoring infrastructure
- Add JWT health metrics to Prometheus/Grafana
- Configure alerting through existing notification channels
- Include JWT status in overall system health reporting

### Validation Scripts
Create automated validation scripts:
- `scripts/validate_jwt_health.py` - Comprehensive JWT configuration check
- `scripts/monitor_jwt_consistency.py` - Continuous monitoring daemon
- `scripts/jwt_secret_rotation_helper.py` - Secret rotation coordination

## Business Impact
- **Segment:** Platform/Reliability
- **Business Goal:** Prevent authentication-related downtime
- **Value Impact:** Proactive detection of JWT issues before customer impact
- **Strategic Impact:** Establishes monitoring patterns for other critical components

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Proactive detection of JWT configuration issues
- [ ] Zero authentication failures due to undetected JWT problems
- [ ] Clear visibility into JWT health across all environments
- [ ] Automated alerting for JWT-related issues
- [ ] Reduced time-to-resolution for authentication problems

## Monitoring Metrics
1. **Configuration Health Score** (0-100%)
   - JWT secret availability: 40 points
   - Cross-service consistency: 30 points
   - Secret format compliance: 20 points
   - Environment alignment: 10 points

2. **Authentication Performance**
   - JWT validation success rate
   - Token generation latency
   - Authentication failure categorization
   - Secret loading performance

3. **Operational Metrics**
   - Time since last secret rotation
   - Configuration drift detection count
   - Alert resolution time
   - Manual intervention frequency

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Health check endpoints (1 week)
- **Phase 2**: Alerting integration (1 week)
- **Phase 3**: Dashboard and automation (2 weeks)

## Related Issues
- **Parent Issue:** #930 (JWT configuration failures)
- **Prerequisites**: [JWT SSOT Consolidation] (architecture cleanup)
- **Infrastructure**: [JWT Staging Configuration] (immediate fix)

## Dependencies
- SSOT JWT architecture implementation
- Monitoring infrastructure availability
- Alert notification system setup
- Dashboard tooling (Grafana/equivalent)

## Priority and Timeline
- **Priority:** P3 (Important for long-term reliability)
- **Timeline:** Implement after SSOT consolidation
- **Dependencies:** Architecture consolidation completed

## Notes
- Focus on **preventing** issues like #930 from recurring
- Build on existing monitoring infrastructure rather than creating new systems
- Ensure monitoring doesn't impact performance of authentication flows
- Design for easy extension to other critical configuration monitoring
