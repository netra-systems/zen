## üîß INFRASTRUCTURE TEAM ACTION ITEMS

**CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES REQUIRING RESOLUTION:**

### P0 - VPC Connector Issues
- **Component**: `staging-connector`
- **Issue**: VPC connectivity failures preventing database and Redis access
- **Evidence**: Redis VPC connectivity "error -3" with IP 10.166.204.83, Database timeout errors

### P0 - Cloud SQL Connectivity
- **Component**: `netra-staging:us-central1:staging-shared-postgres`
- **Issue**: Database connectivity timeouts and connection pool exhaustion
- **Evidence**: Timeout patterns during SMD Phase 3, connection failures to socket endpoints

### P0 - Load Balancer Configuration
- **Component**: GCP Load Balancer for staging domains
- **Issue**: SSL certificate and health check configuration problems
- **Evidence**: SSL failures with deprecated domain patterns, health check timeout misalignment

### P0 - Cloud Run Service Configuration
- **Component**: Backend and Auth Cloud Run services
- **Issue**: Service deployment and resource allocation problems
- **Evidence**: Service startup failures, resource constraint issues, permission problems
