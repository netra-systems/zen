For each open P0 issue:

1) carefully search for related issues.
If found, if reasonable to do so: merge comments and work into the "main" issue and link old issue.
If not reasonable to do that then just link the related issue.

2) note blocking issues or dependency trees
e.g. link other issues that likely need to be solved first to solve this issue (and prevent wheel spinning)
