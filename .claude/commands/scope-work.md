create 5 dedicated prompts for the P0 work that can run in parallel. make it super detailed plan, all the context,
the scope limits, etc. carefully read and link all items in claude.md, e.g. not adding things, covering every single
update to prevent breaks, etc.  CONTEXT: COMPREHENSIVE_SSOT_VIOLATIONS_REPORT.md  ,  early simple plan (lacking
details: PARALLEL_SSOT_REFACTORING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md). save the prompts in .md file. use the other prompt .md files
like chat is king as reference. goal is an "atomic" refactor meaning once all 5 agents complete truly 100% of the
work is done, triple cross checked and tested, legacy files deleted, audited, etc. etc.
