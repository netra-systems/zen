# üî¨ Five Whys Root Cause Analysis with Dynamic Agent Allocation

Deep error analysis using the Five Whys methodology and dynamically allocated specialist agents based on error patterns.

## Configuration
- **Error Description:** $1
- **Initial Agent Count:** ${2:-3}
- **Dynamic Allocation:** Agents spawned based on error type
- **Consensus Threshold:** 80% agreement required
- **Mode:** Five Whys iterative analysis with cascade prevention

## Phase 1: Initial Error Assessment & Five Whys

### 1. Capture Current Error State
!echo "üî¥ CURRENT ERROR STATE:"
!echo "‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ"
!echo "Error: $1"
!echo "Timestamp: $(date)"
!echo ""

### 2. Collect Error Evidence
!echo "üìÑ Collecting error evidence..."

# Check Docker logs for errors
!docker compose logs --tail 200 2>&1 | grep -iE "error|exception|failed|traceback" | tail -30 > /tmp/error_context.log

# Check recent changes
!git log --oneline -10 > /tmp/recent_commits.log

# Save initial state
!git status --short > /tmp/debug_initial_state.txt
!echo "Initial state saved to /tmp/debug_initial_state.txt"

### 3. Five Whys Analysis with Dynamic Agent Spawning

**Root Cause Analyzer - Five Whys Methodology**
@Task: Perform Five Whys analysis on error: $1
Five Whys Analyst:
CRITICAL: Apply the Five Whys methodology systematically:

1. **WHY #1**: Why did the error occur?
   - Analyze the immediate error message
   - Identify the direct trigger
   - Document: "The error occurred because..."

2. **WHY #2**: Why did [answer from Why #1] happen?
   - Dig deeper into the underlying cause
   - Look for system/code issues
   - Document: "This happened because..."

3. **WHY #3**: Why did [answer from Why #2] happen?
   - Examine design/architecture decisions
   - Check for process failures
   - Document: "This was caused by..."

4. **WHY #4**: Why did [answer from Why #3] happen?
   - Investigate organizational/structural issues
   - Review development practices
   - Document: "This resulted from..."

5. **WHY #5**: Why did [answer from Why #4] happen?
   - Identify the root systemic cause
   - Find the fundamental issue
   - Document: "The root cause is..."

After Five Whys, determine which specialist agents are needed:
- If database-related: Request DatabaseSpecialist agent
- If async/context manager: Request AsyncPythonExpert agent
- If WebSocket-related: Request WebSocketSpecialist agent
- If Docker/deployment: Request DevOpsSpecialist agent
- If dependency/import: Request DependencyAnalyst agent
- If performance: Request PerformanceEngineer agent

3. List of required specialist agents
4. Initial remediation hypothesis
