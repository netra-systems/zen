**Title:** GCP-regression | P0 | Missing Monitoring Module Exports Regression

**Labels:** claude-code-generated-issue, P0, regression, monitoring, critical

**Body:**

## Summary
Critical regression: Missing monitoring module error continues to occur despite fix in commit 2f130c108.

## Problem Description
The `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'netra_backend.app.services.monitoring'` error is still causing service startup failures even after the monitoring module exports were fixed.

## Evidence
- **Original Fix:** Commit 2f130c108 (Sep 15, 3:53 PM PDT) added missing exports
- **Current Logs:** 75 incidents between 4:37-5:37 PM PDT (1+ hours after fix)
- **Impact:** Complete service unavailability, container exit(3) failures

## Possible Causes
1. Fix not deployed to staging environment
2. Additional missing exports not covered by original fix
3. Deployment pipeline issue
4. Environment-specific configuration problem

## Business Impact
- $500K+ ARR at risk due to 100% chat unavailability
- Continuous container restart cycles preventing service recovery
- Critical Golden Path functionality completely broken

## Next Steps
1. Verify fix deployment status in staging
2. Check for additional missing monitoring module exports
3. Validate container startup sequence
4. Ensure complete module initialization
