# Test Suite 1: Cold Start Zero to Response - Implementation Plan

## Test Overview
**File**: `tests/unified/test_cold_start_zero_to_response.py`
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Implement First
**Business Impact**: $100K+ MRR
**Performance Target**: < 5 seconds total

## Test Requirements

### Core Functionality to Test
1. Fresh system initialization (no existing state)
2. User signup through Auth service
3. JWT token generation and propagation
4. Backend service initialization with user context
5. WebSocket connection establishment
6. First AI agent message and meaningful response
7. Total time < 5 seconds

### Test Cases (minimum 5 required)

#### Test 1: Complete Cold Start Flow
- Start all services from scratch
- Create new user account
- Establish WebSocket connection
- Send first message
- Receive AI response
- Measure total time < 5s

#### Test 2: Service Health Checks During Cold Start
- Verify Auth service health endpoint
- Verify Backend service health endpoint
- Verify WebSocket readiness
- Check health status codes and response times

#### Test 3: JWT Token Flow in Cold Start
- Create user and get JWT from Auth
- Validate JWT accepted by Backend
- Validate JWT accepted by WebSocket
- Verify token contains correct claims

#### Test 4: Error Handling During Cold Start
- Test with invalid credentials
- Test with malformed requests
- Test with service temporarily unavailable
- Verify appropriate error messages

#### Test 5: Concurrent Cold Starts
- Start multiple users simultaneously
- Verify no race conditions
- Verify proper isolation
- Measure performance under load

#### Test 6: Cold Start State Persistence
- Complete cold start
- Verify user data persisted in Auth DB
- Verify user context in Backend DB
- Verify session state maintained

#### Test 7: Cold Start Performance Breakdown
- Measure Auth service startup time
- Measure Backend service startup time
- Measure JWT generation time
- Measure WebSocket handshake time
- Measure first AI response time

## Implementation Guidelines

### Test Structure
```python
import pytest
import asyncio
import time
from tests.unified.harness import UnifiedTestHarness

class TestColdStartZeroToResponse:
    """
    Business Value: $100K+ MRR protection
    Coverage: Complete system initialization and first user interaction
    Performance: < 5 seconds total
    """
    
    async def test_complete_cold_start_flow(self):
        # Implementation here
        pass
    
    async def test_service_health_during_cold_start(self):
        # Implementation here
        pass
    
    # Additional tests...
```

### Key Utilities to Use
- `UnifiedTestHarness` for service orchestration
- `asyncio` for async operations
- `time.perf_counter()` for performance measurement
- Real services (no mocks)

### Success Criteria
- All tests pass consistently
- Total cold start < 5 seconds
- Clear error messages on failure
- No flaky tests
- Clean resource cleanup

## Agent Responsibilities

### Agent 1: Test Suite Writer
