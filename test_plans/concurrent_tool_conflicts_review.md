## Technical Implementation Strengths

### 1. Async/Await Concurrency Model
The implementation properly leverages Python's asyncio for true concurrent execution:
```python
tasks = [long_running_query(f"agent_{i}") for i in range(concurrent_agents)]
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

### 2. Comprehensive Error Handling
Exception handling covers database-specific scenarios:
```python
except asyncpg.exceptions.DeadlockDetectedError:
    retry_count += 1
    if retry_count <= max_retries:
        await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(0.001, 0.01))
        continue
```

### 3. Statistical Analysis Integration
Real-time metrics calculation with percentile analysis:
```python
self.p95_response_time_ms = statistics.quantiles(sorted_times, n=20)[18]
self.p99_response_time_ms = statistics.quantiles(sorted_times, n=100)[98]
```

### 4. Production-Like Test Data
Realistic test scenarios with proper data volumes and relationship patterns.
