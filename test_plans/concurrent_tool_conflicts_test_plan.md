# Test Suite 7: Concurrent Tool Execution Conflicts Test Plan

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)
- **Segment**: Enterprise, Mid-tier customers
- **Business Goal**: Platform Reliability, Data Integrity, Multi-agent System Stability
- **Value Impact**: Prevents data corruption in high-concurrency scenarios, ensures reliable multi-agent operations for enterprise customers
- **Strategic/Revenue Impact**: Critical for enterprise sales ($100K+ deals), prevents customer data loss incidents, enables confident scaling

## Overview
This test suite validates the Netra Apex platform's ability to handle concurrent agent tools attempting to modify the same database resources while maintaining data consistency, transaction isolation, and deadlock resolution.

## Test Architecture Focus
- **Database Transaction Isolation Levels**: READ_COMMITTED, REPEATABLE_READ, SERIALIZABLE
- **Deadlock Detection and Resolution**: Automated detection, timeout handling, recovery strategies  
- **Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking**: Version-based optimistic control, SELECT FOR UPDATE pessimistic locking
- **Conflict Resolution Strategies**: Last-writer-wins, timestamp-based ordering, priority-based resolution
- **Data Consistency Guarantees**: ACID compliance, eventual consistency validation

## Performance Requirements
- **Concurrent Agent Scale**: 50+ concurrent agents executing tools simultaneously
- **Deadlock Resolution Time**: < 500ms for automatic resolution
- **Transaction Conflict Rate**: < 5% under normal load, < 20% under stress
- **Data Consistency**: 100% accuracy after all concurrent operations complete
- **Recovery Time**: < 2 seconds for system recovery after deadlock cascade

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Database Record Modification Conflicts
**Objective**: Validate transaction isolation when multiple agents modify the same database record

**Scenario**: 
- 10 concurrent agents attempt to update the same user record's `optimization_credits` field
- Each agent tries to deduct credits for different operations
- System must maintain accurate credit balance without race conditions

**Expected Behavior**:
- All transactions complete successfully or fail gracefully
- Final credit balance reflects exact sum of all valid deductions
- No lost updates or phantom credit values
- Deadlock detection triggers within 500ms if conflicts occur

**Test Implementation**:
- Use PostgreSQL transaction isolation levels (READ_COMMITTED, REPEATABLE_READ, SERIALIZABLE)
- Implement optimistic locking with version fields
- Monitor transaction retry counts and deadlock occurrences
- Validate final state consistency across all test runs

### Test Case 2: Agent Tool Resource Pool Exhaustion
**Objective**: Test behavior when concurrent tool executions exhaust shared resource pools

**Scenario**:
- 25 agents simultaneously request connections from database pool (max 20 connections)
- Each agent performs long-running analytical queries
- System must handle pool exhaustion gracefully without deadlocks

**Expected Behavior**:
- Pool exhaustion triggers proper queuing mechanism
- No connection leaks or hanging transactions
- Graceful degradation with appropriate error messages
- Automatic pool recovery after resource release

**Test Implementation**:
- Configure limited connection pool size
- Use connection pool monitoring metrics
- Implement timeout-based resource acquisition
- Validate proper connection cleanup and recycling

### Test Case 3: Optimistic Locking Version Conflicts
**Objective**: Validate optimistic concurrency control using version-based locking

**Scenario**:
- 15 agents attempt to update different fields of the same agent configuration record
- Each agent reads current version, modifies data, and attempts optimistic update
- System must detect version conflicts and handle retries appropriately

**Expected Behavior**:
- Version conflicts detected immediately on commit
- Failed transactions retry with latest version
- Maximum retry limit prevents infinite loops
- Final state contains all valid modifications from successful transactions

**Test Implementation**:
- Use version fields or timestamps for optimistic locking
- Implement exponential backoff for retry logic
- Track conflict rates and retry success patterns
- Validate data integrity after all conflicts resolved

### Test Case 4: Cross-Service Transaction Coordination
**Objective**: Test distributed transaction coordination across microservices

**Scenario**:
- Agent tool execution requires coordinated updates across:
  - Main backend database (user data)
  - Auth service database (permission updates)
  - ClickHouse analytics database (usage metrics)
- Multiple agents trigger these multi-service transactions simultaneously

**Expected Behavior**:
- Two-phase commit protocol ensures atomicity across services
- Service failures trigger proper rollback mechanisms
- No partial updates leave system in inconsistent state
- Compensation actions restore system state on distributed transaction failures

**Test Implementation**:
- Implement distributed transaction coordinator
- Use saga pattern for long-running transactions
- Simulate individual service failures during transactions
- Validate eventual consistency and compensation logic

### Test Case 5: Deadlock Detection and Recovery Cascade
**Objective**: Test system behavior during complex deadlock scenarios involving multiple resources

**Scenario**:
- Create intentional deadlock conditions:
  - Agent A locks Resource 1, waits for Resource 2
  - Agent B locks Resource 2, waits for Resource 3  
  - Agent C locks Resource 3, waits for Resource 1
- System must detect deadlock and resolve automatically

**Expected Behavior**:
- Deadlock detection occurs within 500ms
- Victim selection algorithm chooses appropriate transaction to abort
- Aborted transactions retry with exponential backoff
- System maintains forward progress without manual intervention

**Test Implementation**:
- Create intentional circular wait conditions
- Monitor deadlock detection timing and accuracy
- Implement transaction priority-based victim selection
- Validate system recovery and continued operation

### Test Case 6: Agent Tool State Synchronization
**Objective**: Validate agent state consistency during concurrent tool execution

**Scenario**:
- Multiple agents execute tools that modify shared agent workspace state
- Tools include: file uploads, configuration changes, permission updates
- Concurrent modifications must maintain consistent agent state

**Expected Behavior**:
- Agent state changes are atomic and isolated
- No lost updates to agent configuration or workspace data
- Consistent ordering of state changes across all observers
- Event sourcing provides complete audit trail of modifications

**Test Implementation**:
- Use event sourcing for agent state management
- Implement CQRS pattern for read/write separation
- Monitor state synchronization timing and accuracy
- Validate eventual consistency across distributed agent state

### Test Case 7: Tool Execution Queue Management Under Load
**Objective**: Test tool execution queue behavior under high concurrent load

**Scenario**:
- 100+ tool execution requests submitted simultaneously
- Queue has limited capacity (50 slots) and processing rate limits
- System must manage queue overflow and priority-based processing

**Expected Behavior**:
- Queue overflow triggers appropriate backpressure mechanisms
- Priority-based tool scheduling ensures critical operations complete first
- No tool executions lost or duplicated during overflow conditions
- Metrics provide visibility into queue performance and bottlenecks

**Test Implementation**:
- Configure limited queue capacity and processing rates
- Implement priority-based scheduling algorithms
- Monitor queue depth, processing latency, and overflow events
- Validate tool execution ordering and completion guarantees
