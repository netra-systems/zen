# WebSocket Manager SSOT Phase 2 Migration - Risk Assessment & Execution Plan

**Created:** 2025-09-14
**Issue:** #1182 WebSocket Manager SSOT Migration Phase 2
**Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality protection
**Risk Level:** HIGH - Critical infrastructure migration

## Executive Risk Summary

The WebSocket Manager SSOT Phase 2 migration involves consolidating 341+ fragmented import paths to a single canonical source. This migration is **HIGH RISK** due to WebSocket infrastructure being critical to 90% of platform value delivery through chat functionality.

### Critical Business Dependencies
- **Golden Path User Flow:** Login → Send Message → Receive AI Response
- **Real-time WebSocket Events:** agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, tool_completed, agent_completed
- **Multi-User Isolation:** Enterprise-grade security for HIPAA, SOC2, SEC compliance
- **Chat Value Delivery:** Substantive AI-powered interactions driving revenue

## Migration Execution Plan

### Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] **Mission Critical Tests Passing:** All Golden Path tests operational
- [ ] **Staging Environment Validated:** Full staging functionality confirmed
- [ ] **Baseline Documentation Complete:** Current import patterns documented
- [ ] **Rollback Plan Tested:** Proven ability to restore current state
- [ ] **Team Notification:** Development team aware of migration timing

### Phase 1: Baseline Validation & Risk Assessment (MANDATORY)
**Duration:** 1-2 hours | **Risk Gate:** MANDATORY PASS

```bash
# Execute baseline validation tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/websocket_ssot/test_websocket_manager_import_baseline.py -v
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_websocket_manager_user_isolation_baseline.py -v --real-services
python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_golden_path_websocket_baseline.py -v

# Mission critical validation
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All baseline tests pass (100% success rate)
- Golden Path validated in staging environment
- Performance baseline documented
- Mission critical tests operational

**STOP CONDITION:** Any baseline test failure blocks migration

### Phase 2: Gradual Migration with Continuous Validation
**Duration:** 4-6 hours | **Approach:** Incremental with validation gates

#### Batch 1: Core Infrastructure Files (Low Risk)
- Files: Test framework and utility modules (20-30 files)
- Validation: Factory pattern tests after batch
- Rollback: Immediate if any test failure

#### Batch 2: Agent System Files (Medium Risk)
- Files: Agent execution and orchestration (50-70 files)
- Validation: Full agent workflow tests
- Rollback: Agent-specific rollback plan

#### Batch 3: WebSocket Core Files (HIGH RISK)
- Files: Direct WebSocket functionality (30-40 files)
- Validation: Complete WebSocket event delivery tests
- Rollback: Critical path restoration priority

#### Batch 4: Integration and E2E Files (Medium Risk)
- Files: Remaining test and integration files (200+ files)
- Validation: Full system integration tests
- Rollback: Service-by-service restoration

**Between Each Batch:**
```bash
# Validate Golden Path still functional
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py

# Test migration impact in staging
python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_websocket_migration_impact_staging.py -v

# Performance monitoring
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_websocket_manager_factory_migration.py -v --real-services
```

### Phase 3: Post-Migration Validation & Enhancement Verification
**Duration:** 2-3 hours | **Risk Gate:** MANDATORY PASS

```bash
# SSOT compliance validation
python -m pytest tests/unit/websocket_ssot/test_websocket_manager_ssot_compliance.py -v

# Enterprise security validation
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_websocket_manager_enterprise_security.py -v --real-services

# Complete Golden Path validation
python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_golden_path_ssot_validation_staging.py -v

# Mission critical final validation
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py
```

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% SSOT compliance achieved
- Performance maintained or improved
- Enterprise security validated
- Golden Path enhanced functionality

## Rollback Strategy

### Immediate Rollback Triggers
- Any mission critical test failure
- Golden Path functionality disruption
- WebSocket event delivery failure
- User isolation security breach
- Performance degradation >20%

### Rollback Execution Plan
1. **Immediate:** Stop migration process
2. **Alert:** Notify development team
3. **Restore:** Revert to last known good state
4. **Validate:** Run baseline tests to confirm restoration
5. **Investigate:** Analyze failure and update migration plan

### Rollback Testing (Required Before Migration)
```bash
# Test rollback capability
python -m pytest tests/e2e/staging/test_migration_rollback_capability.py -v
```
