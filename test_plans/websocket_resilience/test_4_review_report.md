        # Block IPs after 5 attempts in 10 minutes
        pass
```

#### 2. Geolocation-Based Security
**Current State:** Basic IP logging  
**Recommendation:** Add geolocation anomaly detection
```python
# Suggested enhancement
class GeolocationSecurity:
    def detect_anomalous_location(self, user_id: str, ip: str) -> bool:
        # Flag attempts from unusual geographic locations
        pass
```

#### 3. Advanced Token Forensics
**Current State:** Basic token fingerprinting  
**Recommendation:** Enhanced token analysis for attack attribution
```python
# Suggested enhancement
class TokenForensics:
    def analyze_token_patterns(self, failed_tokens: List[str]) -> Dict:
        # Analyze token patterns for coordinated attacks
        pass
```
