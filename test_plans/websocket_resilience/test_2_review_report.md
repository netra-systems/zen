   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"Error during streaming: {e}")
       raise
   ```

async def test_high_concurrency_stream_interruption():
    # Test with 100+ concurrent streams
    pass
```

### 3. **Metrics Collection Enhancement** (Low Priority)
Add more detailed metrics collection for production monitoring alignment:
```python
