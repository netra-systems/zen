## Single Agent Context Scope Definition

### Core User Journey Focus:
```
User Authentication → WebSocket Connection → Message Send →
Agent Processing (with Tool Usage) → Real-time Events →
Substantive AI Response → Business Value Delivery
```

### In Scope:
✅ **User Message Processing**: Text messages requesting AI assistance
✅ **Agent Response Generation**: LLM-powered responses with business value
✅ **WebSocket Event Stream**: Real-time progress updates (5 critical events)
✅ **Tool Integration**: Agents using tools to enhance responses
✅ **Business Value Validation**: Responses contain actionable insights
✅ **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication in staging
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user feedback

### Out of Scope:
❌ Multi-user concurrent isolation (separate issue #870)
❌ Infrastructure performance testing (separate issue)
❌ Agent development/training workflows
❌ Admin/management interfaces
❌ Docker-based testing (staging GCP only)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Test Infrastructure Requirements:
- **Environment**: GCP Staging only (no Docker dependencies)
- **Authentication**: Real JWT tokens via staging auth service
- **WebSocket**: wss:// connections to staging backend
- **LLM**: Actual LLM API calls (no mocking)
- **Database**: Real staging database persistence
- **Monitoring**: Test execution metrics and timing

### Test Execution Strategy:
```bash
# Primary test execution command
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category golden_path_staging --pattern "*agent*message*" --staging-e2e --no-docker

# Individual file execution for development
pytest tests/e2e/agent_goldenpath/test_agent_message_pipeline_e2e.py -v --tb=long
```

### Quality Gates:
1. **All tests must pass in GCP staging environment**
2. **No mocking of critical business logic**
3. **Response times under 30s for complex requests**
4. **Business value validation in every test**
5. **Proper error handling and user feedback**

### Success Metrics:
- **Coverage**: 15% → 75% (5x improvement)
- **Business Value**: All tests validate actual business value delivery
- **Reliability**: 95%+ test pass rate in staging environment
- **Performance**: Response times under acceptable thresholds
- **User Experience**: Tests validate positive user experience

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Technical Risks:
1. **Staging Environment Instability**
   - Mitigation: Implement retry logic and graceful degradation
   - Fallback: Local development environment for test development

2. **LLM API Rate Limits/Costs**
   - Mitigation: Implement test throttling and budget monitoring
   - Fallback: Use staging-specific LLM endpoints with limits

3. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - Mitigation: Connection resilience testing and retry mechanisms
   - Fallback: HTTP polling fallback for critical path validation

### Business Risks:
1. **Test Development Timeline**
   - Mitigation: Phased approach with incremental deliverables
   - Fallback: Prioritize highest business value tests first

2. **Resource Allocation**
   - Mitigation: Clear phase gates and success metrics
   - Fallback: Focus on Phase 1 core improvements only
