# SSOT-incomplete-migration-WorkflowOrchestrator-multiple-execution-engines

**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/208  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Priority:** P0 - Critical (Blocks Golden Path)

## Problem Summary
Multiple execution engine implementations violating SSOT principles block Golden Path ($500K+ ARR at risk).

## Discovered Issues
1. **4+ Different Execution Engine Implementations:**
   - SupervisorExecutionEngine
   - ConsolidatedExecutionEngine  
   - CoreExecutionEngine
   - ToolRegistryExecutionEngine

2. **Factory Pattern Inconsistencies:**
   - Multiple factory implementations
   - Confusion about which engine to use
   - Risk of user isolation failures

3. **Mission Critical Test Status:**
   - Test file updated to use `create_test_factory()` 
   - Still need to verify SSOT compliance

## Work Progress

### Step 0: SSOT AUDIT ✅
- [x] Discovered multiple execution engine violations
- [x] Created GitHub issue #208
- [x] Created progress tracker file

### Step 1: DISCOVER AND PLAN TEST ✅
- [x] Found existing tests protecting execution engines (comprehensive coverage)
- [x] Planned test updates for SSOT compliance (60% existing, 20% new validation, 20% regression)
- [x] Identified gaps in test coverage (multi-user concurrent execution, factory enforcement)

**Key Findings:**
- Mission critical test already updated with factory pattern
- 60% focus on updating existing unit/integration tests  
- 20% new SSOT validation tests (designed to fail before fix, pass after)
- 20% new regression prevention tests
- Test execution strategy: unit (no Docker) → integration (real services) → e2e staging

### Step 2: EXECUTE TEST PLAN ✅
- [x] Created new SSOT validation tests (2 test files)
- [x] Tests designed to FAIL before fix, PASS after remediation
- [x] Unit test: `/tests/unit/ssot_validation/test_consolidated_execution_engine_ssot_enforcement.py`
- [x] Integration test: `/tests/integration/ssot_validation/test_execution_engine_factory_consolidation.py`

**Created Tests:**
- Multiple execution engine implementation detection
- Deprecated import pattern validation
- Factory pattern enforcement checks  
- User isolation with real services
- WebSocket event delivery validation
- Performance baseline measurement

### Step 3: PLAN REMEDIATION
- [ ] Plan SSOT consolidation approach
- [ ] Identify primary execution engine

### Step 4: EXECUTE REMEDIATION
- [ ] Implement SSOT consolidation
- [ ] Remove duplicate implementations

### Step 5: TEST FIX LOOP
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Fix any breaking changes

### Step 6: PR AND CLOSURE
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Close GitHub issue

## Files Identified for Review
- `/netra_backend/app/agents/execution_engine_consolidated.py`
- `/netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/execution_engine.py`
- `/netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/request_scoped_execution_engine.py`
- `/tests/mission_critical/test_execution_engine_ssot_consolidation_issues.py`

## Notes
- Test file already updated to use factory pattern
- Need to verify which execution engine should be the SSOT
- Safety first - ensure all tests pass after changes
