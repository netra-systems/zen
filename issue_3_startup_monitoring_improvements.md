# Implement Advanced Startup Monitoring and Circular Dependency Detection

## Problem Statement

Issue #1029 revealed critical gaps in our startup monitoring and error detection capabilities. The system failed to detect circular dependencies during startup, instead manifesting as misleading timeout errors that pointed to infrastructure issues rather than application architecture problems.

## Background

The analysis of issue #1029 identified several monitoring gaps:
- No detection of repeated startup failure patterns
- No circular dependency detection in validation chains
- Poor correlation between symptoms (Redis timeout) and root cause (circular dependency)
- No proactive alerting for startup architecture issues

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Circular Dependency Detection
- [ ] Implement real-time circular dependency detection during startup validation
- [ ] Add dependency graph analysis that can identify potential cycles before they occur
- [ ] Create fast-fail mechanisms that immediately report circular dependencies with clear error messages
- [ ] Add validation that prevents new circular dependencies from being introduced

### Phase 2: Enhanced Startup Monitoring
- [ ] Implement startup phase timing and dependency tracking
- [ ] Add detailed logging for each validation step with clear success/failure indicators
- [ ] Create startup health metrics that distinguish between infrastructure and application issues
- [ ] Add monitoring for startup failure patterns and repetition detection

### Phase 3: Proactive Alerting
- [ ] Configure alerts for circular dependency detection
- [ ] Set up monitoring for abnormal startup patterns (repeated failures, long delays)
- [ ] Create escalation procedures for different types of startup failures
- [ ] Add automated correlation between error symptoms and likely root causes

### Phase 4: Error Message Enhancement
- [ ] Replace misleading timeout messages with specific architectural error descriptions
- [ ] Add contextual information to error messages (what was being validated, why it failed)
- [ ] Implement error message categorization (Infrastructure, Application, Configuration)
- [ ] Create automated suggestions for common startup issues

## Technical Requirements

1. **Real-time Detection**: Circular dependencies must be detected immediately, not after timeouts
2. **Clear Attribution**: Error messages must clearly indicate whether issue is infrastructure or application-level
3. **Actionable Information**: Errors must include specific steps for resolution
4. **Performance Impact**: Monitoring overhead must be minimal (< 5% startup time increase)
5. **Integration**: Must integrate with existing logging and monitoring infrastructure

## Deliverables

1. **Circular Dependency Detector** (`/shared/monitoring/circular_dependency_detector.py`)
   - Real-time analysis of validation dependency chains
   - Fast-fail detection with clear error messages
   - Prevention of new circular dependencies

2. **Enhanced Startup Monitor** (`/shared/monitoring/startup_monitor.py`)
   - Phase-by-phase startup tracking
   - Detailed logging with clear success/failure indicators
   - Integration with existing health check systems

3. **Alert Configuration** (`/monitoring/alerts/startup_alerts.yaml`)
   - Circular dependency detection alerts
   - Abnormal startup pattern detection
   - Escalation procedures for different failure types

4. **Error Message Enhancement** (across relevant validation files)
   - Replace generic timeout messages with specific architectural errors
   - Add contextual information and resolution suggestions
   - Categorize errors by type (Infrastructure, Application, Configuration)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Detection Infrastructure
```python
# Example circular dependency detector interface
class CircularDependencyDetector:
    def add_dependency(self, service: str, depends_on: str) -> None
    def validate_no_cycles(self) -> ValidationResult
    def get_dependency_path(self, start: str, end: str) -> List[str]
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Monitoring
```python
# Example startup phase monitor
class StartupPhaseMonitor:
    def begin_phase(self, phase: StartupPhase) -> None
    def complete_phase(self, phase: StartupPhase, success: bool) -> None
    def get_phase_timing(self) -> Dict[StartupPhase, float]
```

## Success Metrics

- **Circular Dependencies**: 100% detection rate with < 100ms detection time
- **Error Clarity**: 90% reduction in infrastructure investigation for application issues
- **Alert Accuracy**: < 5% false positive rate for startup alerts
- **Resolution Time**: 75% reduction in time to identify startup issue root cause
- **Developer Experience**: Clear, actionable error messages for all startup failures

## Integration Points

- Existing health check endpoints (`/health`)
- Current logging infrastructure (structured logging)
- Monitoring dashboards (GCP monitoring)
- Alert notification systems
