# P1 Import Issue: Missing 'validate_token' import from user_auth_service

## Problem Description
Tests are failing due to missing `validate_token` function import from `netra_backend.app.services.user_auth_service`. The function was removed during SSOT consolidation but tests still reference it.

## Affected Files
- `netra_backend/tests/unit/test_user_auth_service_compatibility.py:31`
- `netra_backend/tests/unit/test_user_auth_service_comprehensive.py:34`

## Error Details
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'validate_token' from 'netra_backend.app.services.user_auth_service'
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The `validate_token` function was removed from `user_auth_service.py` during SSOT consolidation (line 40-41 comments indicate removal). However, unit tests still attempt to import this function directly.

## Current State
- `UserAuthService.validate_token()` method exists and works
- Standalone `validate_token()` function was removed for SSOT compliance
- Tests need to be updated to use class method or auth_client directly

## Business Impact
- 2 auth-related unit tests cannot execute
- Test coverage gaps in authentication validation
- Potential deployment blocking if these tests are required

## Recommended Solution
1. Add back standalone `validate_token` function as alias for backward compatibility
2. OR update tests to use `UserAuthService.validate_token()` method
3. OR update tests to use auth_client directly (preferred SSOT approach)

## Investigation Priority
P1 - Critical test infrastructure blocking test execution
