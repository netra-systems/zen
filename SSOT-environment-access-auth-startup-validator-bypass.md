## SSOT Violation: Direct Environment Access in AuthStartupValidator

### Priority: P0 (CRITICAL - GOLDEN PATH BLOCKER)

**Impact:** This SSOT violation can block user login → AI response flow, affecting $500K+ ARR.

### Problem Description
The AuthStartupValidator directly accesses `os.environ.get()` instead of using the established SSOT `IsolatedEnvironment` pattern, causing authentication validation failures that block the Golden Path.

### Specific Violations
- **File:** `netra_backend/app/core/auth_startup_validator.py`
- **Line 518:** `direct_value = os.environ.get(var_name)`
- **Line 533:** `"os_environ_direct": bool(os.environ.get(var_name))`

### Business Impact
- **Revenue Risk:** $500K+ ARR at risk from authentication failures
- **Golden Path Blocked:** Users cannot login → cannot get AI responses  
- **Customer Experience:** Authentication failures create support tickets and churn risk
- **Environment Detection Issues:** Can cause failures in staging/production environments

### Technical Impact
- **SSOT Violation:** Bypasses established IsolatedEnvironment pattern
- **Security Risk:** Authentication configuration may be incorrectly validated
- **Debugging Complexity:** Creates inconsistent environment access patterns across platform

### Proposed Solution
Replace direct `os.environ.get()` calls with `self.env.get()` since the class already has `self.env = get_env()` initialized.

**Code Change:**
```python
# BEFORE (SSOT Violation)
direct_value = os.environ.get(var_name)
"os_environ_direct": bool(os.environ.get(var_name))

# AFTER (SSOT Compliant)  
direct_value = self.env.get(var_name)
"os_environ_direct": bool(self.env.get(var_name))
```

### Validation Criteria
- [ ] All direct os.environ access removed from auth startup validator
- [ ] Authentication flow tests continue to pass
- [ ] Environment detection works across all environments (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Golden Path user login → AI response flow verified

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code changes implemented and tested
- [ ] All authentication tests passing
- [ ] Golden Path validation successful
- [ ] No regression in authentication functionality

### Related Work
- Builds on completed Issue #667 Configuration Manager SSOT Phase 1
- Part of overall SSOT compliance initiative (currently 89% system health)

**Timeline:** Fix within 1-2 days to unblock Golden Path
