# PR Merge Worklog: PR #329
**Date**: 2025-09-11 16:00:15
**Target**: develop-long-lived (working branch)
**Focus**: SSOT improvements

## Step 0: Branch Status Check - COMPLETED ✅

### Current Branch Verification
- **Current branch**: `develop-long-lived` ✅ CORRECT
- **Branch policy compliance**: PASSED - Working on correct branch

### Working Directory Status
- **Working directory**: Clean (no staged changes)
- **Untracked files**: `PROCESS_CYCLE_5_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` (1 file)
- **Commit status**: Nothing to commit (clean working tree except untracked)

### Remote Sync Status
- **Local commits ahead**: 19 commits
- **Remote commits ahead**: 1 commit  
- **Sync status**: DIVERGED - branches have diverged
- **Action needed**: Integration required (git pull or merge)

### Safety Baseline Established
- **Branch safety**: ✅ On develop-long-lived (correct working branch)
- **Working tree**: ✅ Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- **Untracked files**: Documented and safe to proceed
- **Remote state**: Documented - divergence noted for integration planning

## Branch Divergence Analysis
```
Your branch and 'origin/develop-long-lived' have diverged,
and have 19 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
```

**Interpretation**: 
- Local branch has 19 commits not on remote
- Remote branch has 1 commit not in local
- This is normal for active development branch
- Integration strategy needed for PR #329 merge

## Next Steps Required
1. Analyze divergence commits for merge strategy
2. Plan integration approach (merge vs rebase)
3. Execute PR #329 merge process
4. Maintain develop-long-lived as working branch throughout

## Safety Record
- **Timestamp**: 2025-09-11 16:00:15
- **Working branch confirmed**: develop-long-lived
- **Process integrity**: Maintained
- **Rollback baseline**: Established
