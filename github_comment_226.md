## 🚨 CRITICAL: Correlation Tracking Failure - Enterprise Customer Impact

**URGENT DISCOVERY**: Issue #226 Redis SSOT remediation work **uncovered a critical logging SSOT gap** affecting enterprise customer support capabilities.

### 📊 Test Failure Evidence
- **Test**: `test_customer_support_correlation_tracking_works`
- **Result**: **0.00% correlation tracking rate** (requires 80%+ for enterprise debugging)
- **Business Impact**: **$500,000 ARR customer** cannot receive effective support debugging

### 🔍 Five Whys Root Cause Analysis

**WHY #1**: Correlation tracking rate 0.00%?
→ Mock logging infrastructure doesn't intercept actual logging calls

**WHY #2**: Correlation mechanisms not working?
→ **Code-test mismatch**: Test expects `logger` objects but code uses `central_logger` pattern

**WHY #3**: Logging infrastructure failing to correlate?
→ **Incomplete SSOT migration**: Critical modules still use legacy `central_logger`

**WHY #4**: SSOT logging patterns not implemented?
→ **Partial migration**: SSOT exists but not applied to execution modules

**WHY #5**: Architecture preventing correlation?
→ **Missing link**: Redis SSOT addressed but **logging SSOT gap** remains

### 🔗 Connection to Redis SSOT Work

**Key Finding**: Issue #226 successfully reduced Redis violations (43→34) but **missed the logging layer** that enables correlation tracking.

**Current State**:
- ✅ Redis operations: SSOT compliant
- ❌ Logging operations: Legacy fragmented patterns
- ❌ Correlation tracking: **Completely broken (0%)**

### 💼 Enterprise Impact

**Customer Scenario**: "Agent started but never completed" - Support **cannot correlate logs** across execution chain

**Files Requiring SSOT Migration**:
```
❌ netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/agent_execution_core.py
❌ netra_backend/app/core/agent_execution_tracker.py
```

### 🎯 Immediate Action Plan

**Phase 1** (P0):
1. Migrate execution modules to SSOT logging (`shared.logging.unified_logging_ssot`)
2. Fix correlation context propagation
3. Update test infrastructure

**Phase 2** (P0):
1. Validate 80%+ correlation tracking rate
2. Verify enterprise debugging scenarios

### 📈 Success Metrics
- [ ] Test passes with 80%+ correlation rate
- [ ] Enterprise customer debugging restored
- [ ] Zero regression in Redis SSOT improvements

**Escalating to P0** - This represents the **final missing piece** of Redis SSOT remediation work, directly affecting our ability to support enterprise customers and maintain Golden Path functionality.
