# SSOT-incomplete-migration-logging-config-chaos

**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/192  
**Status:** Step 0 - SSOT Audit Complete  
**Focus:** Logging and Tracing SSOT Violations  

## Problem Discovery

### Critical SSOT Violations Found:
- **5 competing logging configuration systems** preventing consistent log correlation
- **4 incompatible tracing implementations** breaking end-to-end request tracing  
- **27+ fragmented observability patterns** creating debugging chaos
- **121 files with direct logging imports** bypassing unified patterns

### Business Impact:
- **Golden Path Risk:** Cannot debug core user flow (login → AI responses)
- **Revenue Risk:** $500K+ ARR at risk during critical incidents
- **Engineering Impact:** Infinite debugging loops prevent rapid issue resolution
- **Customer Impact:** Chat functionality debugging failures

### Root Cause:
Incomplete migration to unified logging SSOT - multiple systems coexist causing correlation failures.

## Next Steps:
1. DISCOVER AND PLAN TEST (Step 1)
2. Execute test plan (Step 2) 
3. Plan remediation (Step 3)
4. Execute remediation (Step 4)
5. Test fix loop (Step 5)
6. PR and closure (Step 6)

## Files to Track:
- TBD - Will be populated during discovery phase

## Test Plan:
- TBD - Will be defined in Step 1

## Progress Log:
- ✅ Step 0: SSOT Audit complete - Critical logging/tracing violations identified
- ⏳ Step 1: Test discovery and planning (next)
