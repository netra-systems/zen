## 4. Integration Analysis with Current System

### Current Integration Status: NOT INTEGRATED

**Critical Gap**: NACIS exists as isolated code but is not connected to the production system.

### Integration Gaps Identified

#### 4.1 Agent Registration Issues
- **Status**: ❌ NOT REGISTERED
- **Problem**: ChatOrchestrator not registered in AgentRegistry
- **Impact**: Cannot be invoked through supervisor workflow
- **Location**: `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/agent_registry.py`

#### 4.2 Configuration Misalignment
- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Problem**: Uses raw `os.getenv()` instead of unified config system
- **Impact**: Inconsistent configuration management
- **Required**: Integration with `AppConfig` schema

#### 4.3 WebSocket Integration
- **Status**: ⚠️ OUTDATED
- **Problem**: Uses old WebSocket patterns, not UnifiedWebSocketManager
- **Impact**: Incompatible with new `/ws` endpoint security
- **Required**: Update to dependency-injected WebSocketManager

#### 4.4 Triage Routing
- **Status**: ❌ MISSING
- **Problem**: TriageSubAgent doesn't route to NACIS
- **Impact**: No queries reach NACIS even if registered
- **Required**: Update triage intent classification

#### 4.5 Route Configuration
- **Status**: ❌ MISSING
- **Problem**: No routes in `app_factory_route_configs.py`
- **Impact**: No API endpoints for NACIS
- **Required**: Add route configuration if needed

#### 4.6 Helper Module Isolation
- **Status**: ⚠️ ISOLATED
- **Problem**: NACIS modules don't use shared base classes
- **Impact**: Code duplication, inconsistent behavior
- **Required**: Refactor to use unified patterns

### Required Integration Points

#### 1. Agent Registry Integration
```python
# In agent_registry.py - CURRENTLY MISSING
def _register_nacis_agent(self) -> None:
    """Register NACIS agent if enabled."""
    if get_config().nacis.enabled:  # Use unified config
        from netra_backend.app.agents.chat_orchestrator_main import ChatOrchestrator
        self.register("nacis", ChatOrchestrator(
            self.db_session,
            self.llm_manager,
            self.websocket_manager,  # Unified manager
            self.tool_dispatcher
        ))
```

#### 2. Triage Routing Update
```python
# In triage_sub_agent - CURRENTLY MISSING
async def _route_to_nacis(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> bool:
    """Determine if query should route to NACIS."""
    intent_types = ["research", "consultation", "analysis", "veracity_required"]
    return context.intent_type in intent_types and context.confidence >= 0.8
```

#### 3. Configuration Integration
```python
# In AppConfig schema - CURRENTLY MISSING
class NACISConfig(BaseSettings):
    enabled: bool = False
    tier1_model: str = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    tier2_model: str = "gpt-4"

## 8. Conclusion

NACIS represents a **strategically valuable** addition to Netra's platform with strong technical foundations and clear business value. However, it currently exists as an **isolated component** that requires full integration with the unified system before deployment.

**Key Strengths:**
- Modular, extensible architecture
- Strong business case ($500K+ ARR)
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Solid foundation for veracity-first AI

**Critical Integration Gaps:**
- **NOT registered in AgentRegistry**
- **NOT integrated with unified config**
- **NOT connected to triage routing**
- **NOT aligned with WebSocket patterns**
- Incomplete cache implementation
- External API dependencies

**Revised Recommendation:** 
**INTEGRATION REQUIRED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT**. While architecturally sound, NACIS cannot function in production without completing the integration gaps identified. Focus on system integration before feature completion.

### Revised Deployment Strategy
1. **Phase 0** (Week 1): **CRITICAL - Complete system integration**
   - Register in AgentRegistry
   - Integrate with unified config
   - Update triage routing
   - Align WebSocket patterns
2. **Phase 1** (Week 2-3): Complete implementations, internal testing
3. **Phase 2** (Week 4): Limited beta with 10% users
4. **Phase 3** (Month 2): Gradual rollout after integration validation

### Success Metrics
- 95%+ accuracy on benchmark queries
- <2s response time for 60% of queries
- 40% conversion rate improvement
- Zero critical security incidents
