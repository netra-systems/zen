WEBSOCKET MANAGER SSOT CONSOLIDATION TEST REPORT - ISSUE #885
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
- SSOT Compliance: 0.0%
- Total Tests Executed: 5
- Tests Passed: 0
- Tests Failed: 5
- Violations Found: 5

DETAILED TEST RESULTS:
----------------------------------------
❌ FAIL Factory Pattern Violations Detection
     Details: Found 13 factory implementations (expected: 1 SSOT factory)
❌ FAIL Import Path Consolidation
     Details: Found 10 different import patterns across 10217 files
❌ FAIL User Isolation Security Validation
     Details: Found 189 potential isolation violations
❌ FAIL Connection Management SSOT
     Details: Found 1048 files managing connections (expected: 1 SSOT manager)
❌ FAIL WebSocket Module Structure Analysis
     Details: Found WebSocket code in 154 directories and 1530 files

SSOT VIOLATIONS DETECTED:
----------------------------------------
[HIGH] FACTORY_PATTERN_VIOLATION: Found 13 different factory patterns, violates SSOT principle
[HIGH] IMPORT_PATH_FRAGMENTATION: Found 10 different import patterns, violates SSOT import consolidation
[HIGH] USER_ISOLATION_RISK: Found 189 potential user isolation risks
[HIGH] CONNECTION_MANAGEMENT_FRAGMENTATION: Found 1048 files with connection management - violates SSOT
[HIGH] MODULE_STRUCTURE_FRAGMENTATION: WebSocket code scattered across 154 directories - violates SSOT organization

REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------------------------------
• CRITICAL: Consolidate multiple WebSocket factory implementations into single SSOT factory pattern
• HIGH: Standardize WebSocket import paths to single canonical import location
• HIGH: Consolidate connection management into single SSOT WebSocket manager
• MEDIUM: Reorganize WebSocket modules into cohesive SSOT structure
• CRITICAL: Address user isolation risks to prevent cross-user data contamination
• Implement phased SSOT migration plan starting with highest severity violations
• Establish SSOT validation gates in CI/CD pipeline to prevent regression

================================================================================

INTEGRATION TEST RESULTS:
----------------------------------------
Module Import Success Rate: 100.0% (3/3)
WebSocket Instantiation Test: ✅ PASS

STAGING TEST RESULTS:
----------------------------------------
connection_test: MOCK_PASS
authentication_test: MOCK_PASS
chat_functionality_test: MOCK_PASS
stability_test: MOCK_PASS
Note: Actual staging tests require GCP environment access
