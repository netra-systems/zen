# PR-WORKLOG-195: SSOT Logging/WebSocket Consolidation - 20250910

## PR Overview
**PR #195:** SSOT-PR-195: Eliminate Critical Logging/WebSocket SSOT Violations - $500K+ ARR Golden Path Protection  
**Branch:** `critical-remediation-20250823` ‚Üí `main`  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFLICTING - Cannot merge due to conflicts

## Business Impact
- **$500K+ ARR Protection:** Restores Golden Path chat debugging capabilities
- **SSOT Consolidation:** 4+ logging configs ‚Üí 1 unified, 9 WebSocket managers ‚Üí 1 canonical
- **Incident Response:** 75% faster troubleshooting, 60% logging maintenance reduction

## Current Blockers
1. **Merge Conflicts:** Branch conflicts with main, preventing merge
2. **No Status Checks:** CI/CD not running due to conflicts
3. **No Reviews:** Large PR (100+ files) requires review assignment

## Files Changed: 100+ (High Risk)
- **Key Files:**
  - `shared/logging/unified_logging_ssot.py` (877 lines) - New canonical logging
  - `netra_backend/app/websocket_core/unified_manager.py` - Enhanced WebSocket manager
  - 4,205+ test lines across 4 tiers

## Work Log

### 2025-09-10 Initial Analysis
- ‚úÖ Read PR #195 via gh command
- ‚úÖ Identified merge conflicts blocking merge
- ‚úÖ Documented business impact and risk assessment
- üîÑ **ATTEMPTED:** Merge conflict resolution

### 2025-09-10 CRITICAL SAFETY STOP
- üö® **OPERATION TERMINATED FOR SAFETY**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Branch divergence:** 28/42 commits difference (potential data loss)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Uncommitted changes:** Risk of losing local work
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential duplicate merge:** Evidence PR #195 may already be merged via develop-long-lived
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unstable working directory:** File modifications detected during checkout

## üõë HUMAN INTERVENTION REQUIRED

**STATUS:** Operation halted - too risky for automated resolution

### Recommended Manual Steps:
1. Preserve current work: `git stash push -m "Work in progress before PR 195 merge resolution"`
2. Get senior developer review of branch divergence
3. Determine if PR #195 already merged through develop-long-lived branch
4. Clean state recovery: `git checkout develop-long-lived && git pull origin develop-long-lived`
5. Manual conflict analysis with isolated test branch

### Related Context:
- WebSocket test failure in staging (STAGING_TEST_REPORT_PYTEST.md shows 0.0% pass rate)
- PR #195 addresses WebSocket SSOT consolidation - may be related to current failures

## Risk Assessment: HIGH
- **100+ file changes** in core infrastructure
- **Business critical** functionality affected
- **Comprehensive test coverage** provides mitigation
- **Backward compatibility** maintained via wrappers

## Safety Protocol
- FIRST DO NO HARM: Stop if any action might damage repo health
- Atomic changes only
- Full test validation required before merge
- Rollback plan: Previous main branch state preserved
