## ðŸš¨ Container Exit Pattern Update - Sep 15, 2025, 5:40 PM PDT

### Latest Evidence from GCP Logs (4:37-5:37 PM PDT)
- **Container Exit(3) Frequency:** 15 incidents in the last hour
- **Pattern:** Recurring every ~7 minutes as containers attempt restart
- **Root Cause Correlation:** Exit(3) calls triggered by both:
  1. Missing monitoring module errors (75 incidents)
  2. Database connectivity timeouts (continuing from original issue)

### Sample Log Entry
```json
{
  "textPayload": "Container called exit(3) due to startup failure",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-15T23:50:43.125002+00:00"
}
```

### Analysis Update
- Container exit(3) behavior is **working as designed** - proper response to startup failures
- The 7-minute restart cycle indicates Cloud Run is correctly attempting recovery
- **Root causes remain the same:** Database connectivity + Missing monitoring exports

### Business Impact Escalation
- Service unavailability cycles continue affecting $500K+ ARR
- 100% chat functionality still blocked due to continuous restart loops
- Infrastructure crisis requires **immediate P0 resolution**

### Coordination with Related Issues
- Missing monitoring module regression issue created today
- Both issues contributing to exit(3) pattern
- Fixing either root cause should reduce container restart frequency
