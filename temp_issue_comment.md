## Five Whys Root Cause Analysis

**BREAKTHROUGH:** The issue is NOT missing pytest - pytest is installed correctly. The problem is in the Python command detection logic.

### Five Whys Analysis:

1. **Why did unit tests fail?** - Because of "No module named pytest" error
2. **Why was there a "No module named pytest" error?** - Because the test runner was trying to use `python3` command which doesn't exist on Windows
3. **Why was it trying to use `python3` command?** - Because the `_detect_python_command()` method in unified_test_runner.py tries 'python3' first, then 'python', then 'py'
4. **Why didn't it fallback to 'python' or 'py'?** - Because there's a bug in the detection logic - when detection fails, it defaults to 'python3' instead of a working command
5. **Why does the detection fail on Windows?** - Because Windows Python installations don't provide `python3` as a command (they use `python` and `py`)

### Technical Evidence:

**Pytest IS installed correctly:**
```bash
$ pip list | grep pytest
pytest                             8.4.2
pytest-asyncio                     1.1.0
pytest-cov                         7.0.0
pytest-mock                        3.15.0
pytest-timeout                     2.4.0
pytest-xdist                       3.8.0
pytest-xvfb                        3.1.1
```

**Command detection issue on Windows:**
```bash
$ python3 --version
Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store
$ python --version
Python 3.13.7
$ py --version
Python 3.13.7
```

### Root Cause Location:
File: `tests/unified_test_runner.py`
Method: `_detect_python_command()` (lines 336-360)
Issue: Fallback defaults to 'python3' which doesn't exist on Windows

### Business Impact Update:
- **Severity:** Still P0 but different solution needed
- **Root Cause:** Platform-specific command detection bug, not dependency issue
- **Solution:** Fix the Python command detection logic for Windows compatibility

**Status:** Ready for remediation planning
