## ðŸš¨ MISSION CRITICAL TEST FAILURE RELATED TO ISSUE #1186

**Test Failure:** test_execution_engine_websocket_initialization
**Error:** UserExecutionEngine missing websocket_notifier attribute
**Impact:** $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality affected

### Failure Details
```
tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_mission_critical_fixed.py::TestMissionCriticalWebSocketEvents::test_execution_engine_websocket_initialization FAILED
AssertionError: CRITICAL: Missing websocket_notifier
assert False
 +  where False = hasattr(UserExecutionEngine(engine_id=user_engine_test-user_test-run_1757928660378, user_id=test-user, active_runs=0, is_active=True), 'websocket_notifier')
```

### Five Whys Analysis
**Why #1:** Why is UserExecutionEngine missing websocket_notifier?
**Finding:** Recent constructor changes require dependency injection but websocket_notifier not properly injected

**Why #2:** Why wasn't websocket_notifier included in dependency injection changes?
**Finding:** Constructor update to UserExecutionEngine(context, agent_factory, websocket_emitter) may not include websocket_notifier setup

**Why #3:** Why does mission critical test expect websocket_notifier attribute?
**Finding:** WebSocket events are critical for chat functionality - test validates integration is working

**Why #4:** Why wasn't this caught in previous SSOT consolidation testing?
**Finding:** Previous testing focused on import patterns, not attribute availability after dependency injection

**Why #5:** Why is this blocking Golden Path?
**Root Cause:** WebSocket integration broke during UserExecutionEngine dependency injection refactoring

### Business Impact
- **Critical:** Mission critical WebSocket tests failing
- **Revenue Risk:** $500K+ ARR Golden Path chat functionality potentially affected
- **User Experience:** Real-time WebSocket events may not work properly

### Immediate Action Required
This test failure appears directly related to the UserExecutionEngine constructor changes mentioned in the Phase 4 validation. Need to ensure websocket_notifier attribute is properly set during UserExecutionEngine initialization.

**Status:** Actively investigating and will provide remediation plan.
