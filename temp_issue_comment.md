## Test Run Update - SSOT WebSocket Manager Warning Confirmed

**Test Execution Date:** 2025-09-13 22:13

During integration test run with `python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category integration --fast-fail --execution-mode commit --no-docker`, the SSOT WebSocket Manager fragmentation warning was confirmed:

### SSOT Warning Detected
```
SSOT WARNING: Found other WebSocket Manager classes: ['netra_backend.app.websocket_core.websocket_manager']
```

### Test Impact Analysis
- **Unit Tests:** FAILED (return code: 1)
- **Integration Tests:** SKIPPED due to fast-fail triggered by unit test failures
- **Database Tests:** PASSED (39.68s)

### Current System State
- **SSOT Compliance:** Still showing WebSocket Manager fragmentation warnings in test output
- **Business Impact:** Unit test failures prevent full integration test validation
- **Priority Escalation:** Unit test failures blocking progression to integration tests

### Five Whys Analysis
1. **Why are integration tests being skipped?** Unit tests are failing triggering fast-fail mode
2. **Why are unit tests failing?** Multiple issues including SSOT violations in WebSocket managers
3. **Why do SSOT violations persist?** Previous consolidation efforts did not fully eliminate duplicate definitions
4. **Why weren't all duplicates eliminated?** Incomplete migration of WebSocketManagerMode and protocol interfaces
5. **Why is this blocking the golden path?** Chat functionality depends on reliable WebSocket infrastructure

### Recommendation
- **Priority:** Escalate to P1 - blocking integration test validation
- **Action Required:** Complete SSOT consolidation before integration testing can proceed
- **Business Risk:** Chat functionality instability affects 90% of platform value
