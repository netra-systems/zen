# SSOT-regression-missing-execute-agent-blocks-golden-path

## Issue Details
- **GitHub Issue:** #346
- **Priority:** P0 Critical 
- **Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR at risk
- **Status:** Created
- **Created:** 2025-01-11

## Problem Statement
During SSOT consolidation, the `execute_agent` function was removed from `agent_execution_core.py` but imports still reference it, causing ImportError and blocking golden path user flow.

## Business Impact
- **Revenue Risk:** $500K+ ARR blocked
- **User Impact:** 100% of users affected - cannot get AI responses
- **Platform Value:** 90% of business value (chat functionality) broken

## Files Affected
- `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/agent_execution_core.py` - Missing execute_agent function
- Golden path user flow tests failing with import errors

## SSOT Gardener Progress Tracking

### Step 0: DISCOVER SSOT Issue ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] SSOT audit completed by subagent
- [x] Critical violation identified: missing execute_agent function
- [x] GitHub issue created: #346
- [x] Local progress tracker created
- [x] Initial commit and push: PENDING

### Step 1: DISCOVER AND PLAN TEST (PENDING)
- [ ] Discover existing tests protecting agent execution
- [ ] Plan unit/integration tests for execute_agent function
- [ ] Plan SSOT compliance tests

### Step 2: EXECUTE TEST PLAN (PENDING)
- [ ] Create new SSOT tests (20% of work)
- [ ] Validate test failures reproduce the issue

### Step 3: PLAN REMEDIATION (PENDING)
- [ ] Plan SSOT-compliant execute_agent implementation
- [ ] Design function signature and integration points

### Step 4: EXECUTE REMEDIATION (PENDING)
- [ ] Implement missing execute_agent function
- [ ] Ensure SSOT compliance

### Step 5: TEST FIX LOOP (PENDING)
- [ ] Run existing tests (60% of work)
- [ ] Fix any test failures
- [ ] Validate golden path works end-to-end

### Step 6: PR AND CLOSURE (PENDING)
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Link to issue #346 for auto-closure
- [ ] Verify tests pass in CI

## Notes
- Function was removed during SSOT consolidation but imports remained
- Critical for golden path: users login → get AI responses
- Must maintain SSOT compliance while restoring functionality
