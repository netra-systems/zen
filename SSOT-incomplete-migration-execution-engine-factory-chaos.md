- [ ] **Test Fix Loop**: Ensure all tests pass after remediation
- [ ] **PR Creation**: Create pull request to close issue

## üöÄ MAJOR TEST DISCOVERY: 417 Relevant Test Files Found!

### ‚úÖ EXISTING COMPREHENSIVE TEST COVERAGE

**Mission Critical Tests Already Exist:**
1. **`tests/mission_critical/test_agent_factory_ssot_validation.py`**
   - Tests designed to FAIL with current violations, PASS after SSOT
   - Validates agent factory SSOT compliance
   - Protects $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality
   - Tests user isolation and WebSocket manager factory patterns

2. **`tests/unit/ssot_validation/test_issue_686_execution_engine_consolidation.py`**
   - Tests ExecutionEngine SSOT consolidation (Issue #686)
   - Designed to FAIL with violations, PASS after consolidation
   - Validates single ExecutionEngine SSOT implementation
   - Tests deprecated execution_engine.py redirects

3. **`tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py`**
   - MISSION CRITICAL: Business value $500K+ ARR
   - Uses UserExecutionEngine as SSOT (target state!)
   - Real WebSocket connections to actual backend services
   - Tests all critical WebSocket event flows

4. **`tests/e2e/execution_engine_ssot/test_golden_path_execution.py`**
   - Complete Golden Path: login ‚Üí agent execution ‚Üí AI response
   - Uses UserExecutionEngine SSOT
   - Expected to FAIL before consolidation, PASS after
   - Protects core business value flow

### üìä Test Coverage Analysis
- **417 total relevant test files** covering execution engine, agent factory, WebSocket patterns
- **Mission Critical Tests**: Comprehensive coverage of business-critical functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Extensive real service testing without mocks
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user journey validation
- **Unit Tests**: SSOT validation and factory pattern compliance

## CRITICAL SSOT Violations Found

### üö® Execution Engine Factory Chaos
**Files with duplicate factory implementations:**
1. `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/execution_engine_unified_factory.py`
2. `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/execution_engine_factory.py` (MODIFIED)
3. `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/execution_factory.py`
4. `netra_backend/app/agents/supervisor/agent_instance_factory.py` (MODIFIED)
5. Additional factory patterns throughout agent system

### Business Impact
- **BLOCKS GOLDEN PATH**: Users login ‚Üí get AI responses flow failing
- **$500K+ ARR AT RISK**: Chat functionality unreliable
- **WebSocket Race Conditions**: Event loss causing customer failures
- **Active Development Conflict**: Git modifications to affected files

### Golden Path Failure Mode
1. User logs in successfully ‚úÖ
2. User sends chat message ‚úÖ
3. **FAILURE**: Agent execution engine creation inconsistent ‚ùå
4. **FAILURE**: WebSocket events lost due to factory race conditions ‚ùå
5. **FAILURE**: User receives no AI response ‚ùå

## üéØ SSOT TARGET STATE DISCOVERED

**From existing tests, the target SSOT architecture is clear:**
- **UserExecutionEngine**: Single Source of Truth for execution engine
- **Deprecated**: `execution_engine.py` should redirect to UserExecutionEngine
- **AgentRegistry**: Should use SSOT factory patterns
- **WebSocket Integration**: Already working correctly with UserExecutionEngine

## Test Plan (MINIMAL NEW TESTS NEEDED)

### ‚úÖ EXISTING TESTS TO LEVERAGE (95% of coverage)
**417 test files provide comprehensive coverage:**
- Mission critical validation of agent factory SSOT
- ExecutionEngine consolidation validation
- WebSocket agent events with real services
- Golden Path end-to-end testing
- User isolation and concurrency testing

### üîç NEW TESTS NEEDED (~5% effort - minimal additions)
**Gap Analysis suggests only small additions needed:**
1. **Factory Instance Count Validation**: Test that only ONE factory instance exists
2. **Import Path Validation**: Test that all imports resolve to SSOT implementations
3. **Migration State Validation**: Test that no mixed factory states exist during transition

## Remediation Strategy (To Be Planned)

### SSOT Consolidation Goals
1. **Single Authority**: Choose ONE execution engine factory as SSOT
2. **Migration Plan**: Move all consumers to SSOT factory
3. **Cleanup**: Remove all duplicate implementations
4. **Validation**: Ensure Golden Path reliability

## Testing Status
- **Docker Dependency**: Will use non-docker tests (unit, integration without docker, e2e on staging GCP)
- **Real Services**: Prefer real services over mocks for integration testing
- **Mission Critical**: Must pass WebSocket agent events suite

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Only ONE execution engine factory exists
- [ ] All agent creation uses SSOT factory
- [ ] WebSocket events reliably delivered
- [ ] Golden Path test passes: users login ‚Üí get AI responses
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
