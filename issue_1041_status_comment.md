**Status:** Issue requires immediate action - 9,235 Test* classes identified across 5,126 files

**Key Findings:**
- Scope significantly larger than initially documented (9,235 vs 370 instances)
- Collection performance acceptable for individual files (0.06s for 13 tests)
- Comprehensive remediation plan and automated fix script ready for execution
- System stability validation confirms no breaking changes from previous fixes

**FIVE WHYS Analysis:**
1. **Why still open?** 9,235 Test* classes across 5,126 files need renaming
2. **Why so many classes?** Automated fix script not fully executed across codebase
3. **Why not executed?** Larger scope requires careful validation before mass changes
4. **Why scope different?** Initial reports focused on WebSocket duplicates, actual scope includes all Test* interference
5. **Why impacts development?** Collection degradation affects developer productivity and CI/CD reliability

**Evidence of Readiness:**
- ✅ Automated fix script operational (`scripts/fix_issue_1041_test_class_renaming.py`)
- ✅ Comprehensive test validation framework established
- ✅ System stability proven with previous migrations
- ✅ Performance benchmarks show rapid collection (0.06s vs previous timeouts)
- ✅ Risk mitigation with automatic backups and rollback procedures

**Implementation Status:**
- **Phase 1:** SSOT utilities created and validated ✅
- **Phase 2:** Mission critical tests migrated ✅
- **Phase 3:** Comprehensive migration pending execution
- **Phase 4:** Full codebase cleanup required

**Next Action:** Execute automated fix with `python scripts/fix_issue_1041_test_class_renaming.py` to rename 9,235 Test* classes, followed by comprehensive validation testing
