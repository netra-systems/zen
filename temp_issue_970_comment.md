## ✅ FIXED: Test Logic Error in WebSocket Event Emission Compliance

**Issue Status:** RESOLVED
**Fix Type:** Test Logic Bug (Not a System Bug)
**Test Status:** ✅ PASSING

### Root Cause Analysis
The test `test_websocket_event_emission_compliance` was failing due to an **invalid state transition sequence**. The test was attempting to transition directly from `THINKING` → `TOOL_EXECUTING`, which violates the agent state machine's transition rules.

### What Was Wrong
According to the state transition matrix, the correct flow is:
```
THINKING → TOOL_PLANNING → TOOL_EXECUTING → TOOL_PROCESSING → TOOL_COMPLETED
```

The test was missing the `TOOL_PLANNING` state, causing it to never reach the `TOOL_EXECUTING` and `TOOL_COMPLETED` states needed for WebSocket event validation.

### Fix Implemented
**File:** `netra_backend/tests/unit/agents/test_agent_execution_state_machine_comprehensive_unit.py`

**Change:** Added missing `TOOL_PLANNING` state to the lifecycle sequence:

```python
# BEFORE (Invalid)
full_lifecycle = [
    (AgentExecutionState.READY, AgentExecutionEvent.INITIALIZE),
    (AgentExecutionState.STARTING, AgentExecutionEvent.START_EXECUTION),
    (AgentExecutionState.THINKING, AgentExecutionEvent.BEGIN_THINKING),
    (AgentExecutionState.TOOL_EXECUTING, AgentExecutionEvent.EXECUTE_TOOL),  # ❌ Invalid transition
    # ... rest
]

# AFTER (Fixed)
full_lifecycle = [
    (AgentExecutionState.READY, AgentExecutionEvent.INITIALIZE),
    (AgentExecutionState.STARTING, AgentExecutionEvent.START_EXECUTION),
    (AgentExecutionState.THINKING, AgentExecutionEvent.BEGIN_THINKING),
    (AgentExecutionState.TOOL_PLANNING, AgentExecutionEvent.PLAN_TOOLS),    # ✅ Added this
    (AgentExecutionState.TOOL_EXECUTING, AgentExecutionEvent.EXECUTE_TOOL),
    # ... rest
]
```

### Validation
✅ **Test Now Passing:**
```bash
netra_backend/tests/unit/agents/test_agent_execution_state_machine_comprehensive_unit.py::TestAgentExecutionStateMachineUnit::test_websocket_event_emission_compliance PASSED
```

✅ **All 5 Critical WebSocket Events Validated:**
- `agent_started`
- `agent_thinking`
- `tool_executing`
- `tool_completed`
- `agent_completed`

### Business Value Protected
- ✅ **Golden Path Compliance:** Test now correctly validates all 5 business-critical WebSocket events
- ✅ **$500K+ ARR Protection:** WebSocket event delivery validation working as designed
- ✅ **No System Changes Required:** Production system was already working correctly

### Key Insight
This was a **test logic bug**, not a system bug. The production WebSocket event system was already working correctly - the test just had an invalid transition sequence that prevented proper validation.
