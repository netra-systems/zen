## Critical Test Scenarios Covered

### 1. Knowledge Base Update Validation
- Corpus creation and immediate availability
- Update propagation to dependent agents
- Version tracking and consistency
- Impact on optimization recommendations

### 2. Concurrent Modifications
- Simultaneous corpus creation by 5+ agents
- Conflict resolution for UPDATE/DELETE operations
- Resource locking during large operations
- No data corruption under concurrent access

### 3. Impact on Agent Decisions
- Data Agent queries using updated corpus
- Optimization Agent leveraging new knowledge
- Reporting Agent including corpus changes
- Action Plan Agent basing recommendations on corpus

### 4. Rollback Scenarios
- Database rollback on operation failures
- State cleanup on approval denial
- Recovery from tool dispatcher failures
- Consistency after partial failures

## Performance Benchmarks

### Operation Timing Requirements
- **CREATE operation:** < 5 seconds for large corpus
- **SEARCH operation:** < 1 second response time
- **UPDATE operation:** < 3 seconds for bulk updates
- **Concurrent operations:** 30% improvement over sequential

### Load Testing Results
- Successfully handles 10 concurrent corpus creations
