# Frontend Auth Service Alignment Audit Report

## Executive Summary
The frontend has been audited for alignment with the dedicated auth service. Several **critical misalignments** have been identified that need immediate correction.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Port Inconsistency ❌
**Issue**: Multiple conflicting port configurations for the auth service
- `.env`: `AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8083`
- `frontend/.env.local`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8083`
- `frontend/lib/auth-service-config.ts`: Defaults to `8081`
- `dev_launcher`: Uses `8081` as default
- `network_constants.py`: Defines `AUTH_SERVICE_DEFAULT: 8081`

**Impact**: Auth service may fail to connect depending on which configuration is loaded

### 2. Environment Variable Naming Inconsistency ❌
**Issue**: Multiple environment variable names for the same purpose
- `AUTH_SERVICE_URL` (backend .env)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_SERVICE_URL` (frontend)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_API_URL` (fallback in auth-service-config.ts)
- `AUTH_SERVICE_PORT` (dev_launcher)

**Impact**: Configuration confusion and potential connection failures

### 3. Test Environment Misalignment ⚠️
**Issue**: Tests hardcoded to port 8081 while dev environment uses 8083
- `jest.setup.js`: Hardcoded to `http://localhost:8081`
- Tests in `__tests__/unified_system/oauth-flow.test.tsx`: Hardcoded to 8081

**Impact**: Tests may pass but production fails due to different ports

## Current State Analysis

### Frontend Auth Integration ✅
**Working Correctly**:
1. `auth-service-config.ts` properly centralizes auth endpoint configuration
2. `auth/service.ts` correctly uses the auth service client
3. Token handling is properly implemented with localStorage
4. Auth context correctly manages user state and token refresh

### Auth Service Independence ✅
**Working Correctly**:
1. Auth service runs as independent microservice
2. Has its own main.py entry point at `auth_service/main.py`
3. Proper CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
4. Health endpoints available at `/health` and `/health/ready`

### API Calls Routing ✅
**Working Correctly**:
1. Frontend auth calls go to auth service endpoints
2. Backend API calls use separate port (8000)
3. WebSocket connections properly authenticated with tokens

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Standardize Auth Service Port**
   - Choose ONE port: Recommend `8081` (as defined in `network_constants.py`)
   - Update ALL configurations to use this port consistently

2. **Fix Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # .env (root)
   AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8081
   AUTH_SERVICE_PORT=8081
   
   # frontend/.env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8081
   ```

3. **Update Dev Launcher**
   - Ensure dev_launcher consistently uses port from `network_constants.py`
   - Remove hardcoded port values

4. **Fix Test Configuration**
   - Update `jest.setup.js` to use environment variables
   - Ensure tests can run with different port configurations

### Code Changes Needed

1. **frontend/lib/auth-service-config.ts:48**
   ```typescript
   // Change from:
   baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8081';
   // To:
   baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_SERVICE_URL || 'http://localhost:8081';
   ```

2. **Root .env file**
   - Change `AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8083` to `AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8081`

3. **frontend/.env.local**
   - Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8083` to `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8081`

## Validation Steps

After fixes are applied:
1. Run `python scripts/dev_launcher.py` and verify auth service starts on port 8081
2. Test login flow in development mode
3. Run frontend tests: `cd frontend && npm test`
4. Verify OAuth callback URLs are correctly configured
5. Test token refresh mechanism

## Conclusion

The frontend is **mostly aligned** with the dedicated auth service architecture, but **critical port configuration issues** must be resolved immediately. The auth service separation is properly implemented, but inconsistent configuration across different parts of the system creates deployment and testing risks.

**Priority**: HIGH - Fix port inconsistencies before next deployment
