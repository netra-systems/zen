# Issue #930 Manual Execution Checklist

## Overview
Since GitHub CLI commands require approval, this checklist provides the manual steps to complete the issue #930 resolution plan.

## Step 1: Create Focused GitHub Issues

### ðŸ”´ P0 - Critical: JWT Staging Environment Configuration Fix
**Issue Content**: Use file `issue_jwt_staging_fix.md`
**Labels**: `priority-p0`, `infrastructure`, `staging`
**Assignee**: Platform/DevOps team member
**Milestone**: Current sprint (immediate)

### ðŸŸ¡ P2 - Important: JWT Authentication SSOT Architecture Consolidation
**Issue Content**: Use file `issue_jwt_ssot_consolidation.md`
**Labels**: `priority-p2`, `architecture`, `technical-debt`
**Assignee**: Backend architecture team
**Milestone**: Next sprint

### ðŸŸ¢ P3 - Documentation: JWT Authentication Flow Documentation
**Issue Content**: Use file `issue_jwt_documentation.md`
**Labels**: `priority-p3`, `documentation`
**Assignee**: Technical writer or backend team
**Milestone**: Future sprint

### ðŸŸ¢ P3 - Monitoring: JWT Configuration Health Monitoring
**Issue Content**: Use file `issue_jwt_monitoring.md`
**Labels**: `priority-p3`, `monitoring`, `reliability`
**Assignee**: Platform/SRE team
**Milestone**: Future sprint

## Step 2: Update Original Issue #930

### Add Resolution Comment
1. Go to issue #930 in GitHub
2. Add comment using content from `issue_930_resolution_comment.md`
3. Include links to the newly created focused issues
4. Explain the decomposition strategy and next steps

### Close Original Issue
1. Change issue status to "Closed"
2. Add closing comment referencing the focused issues
3. Use label "resolved-by-decomposition" if available

## Step 3: Execute Immediate Fix (P0)

### Validate Current JWT Configuration
1. Check GCP Cloud Run staging environment
2. Look for `JWT_SECRET_STAGING` environment variable
3. Document current configuration status

### Configure Missing Variable (if needed)
1. Access GCP Console for staging project
2. Navigate to Cloud Run service configuration
3. Add `JWT_SECRET_STAGING` environment variable
4. Use appropriate staging-specific secret value
5. Deploy configuration update

### Validation
1. Run staging deployment health checks
2. Verify JWT authentication functionality
3. Test Golden Path end-to-end functionality
4. Monitor logs for JWT-related errors

## Step 4: Project Management Updates

### Update Sprint Planning
1. Add P0 issue to current sprint backlog
2. Schedule P2 issue for next sprint
3. Add P3 issues to product backlog
4. Update sprint capacity planning

### Communication
1. Notify team of issue decomposition
2. Explain simplified approach and priorities
3. Update relevant stakeholders on timeline
4. Schedule follow-up for architecture work

## Step 5: Documentation Updates

### Update Project Status
1. Update `MASTER_WIP_STATUS.md` to reflect issue resolution
2. Add entry to lessons learned documentation
3. Update architecture compliance tracking
4. Record process improvement insights

### Archive Analysis
1. Move analysis files to appropriate archive folder
2. Keep master plan and execution summary accessible
3. Update issue tracking spreadsheet/system
4. Create reference for future similar issues

## Step 6: Monitoring and Follow-up

### Track Immediate Fix
1. Monitor staging environment post-fix
2. Watch for any JWT-related issues
3. Confirm Golden Path stability
4. Document fix effectiveness

### Plan Architecture Work
1. Schedule architecture consolidation work
2. Allocate appropriate resources
3. Define success criteria and timeline
4. Plan SSOT integration approach

## Success Validation Checklist

### âœ… Immediate Success (P0)
- [ ] JWT authentication works in staging environment
- [ ] Golden Path functionality restored
- [ ] No JWT-related errors in staging logs
- [ ] Original issue #930 properly closed

### âœ… Process Success
- [ ] Four focused issues created with clear scope
- [ ] Appropriate priorities and assignments set
- [ ] Team understands new approach
- [ ] Documentation updated

### âœ… Long-term Setup
- [ ] Architecture work scheduled

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If immediate fix causes issues:
1. **Stop**: Halt any ongoing deployments
2. **Revert**: Restore previous GCP configuration
3. **Validate**: Confirm system returns to previous state
4. **Analyze**: Document what went wrong
5. **Adjust**: Update approach based on learnings
