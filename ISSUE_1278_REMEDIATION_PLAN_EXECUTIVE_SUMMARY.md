## Remediation Strategy Overview

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Emergency Response (0-60 minutes)
**OWNER:** Infrastructure Team  
**PRIORITY:** P0 CRITICAL  
**BUSINESS IMPACT:** Service restoration foundation  

**Key Actions:**
1. **VPC Connector Crisis Resolution** (0-15 min)
   - Scale connector: 30 max instances, e2-standard-4 machine type
   - Ensure READY state with proper networking
   - Validate Redis/Cloud SQL connectivity

2. **Cloud SQL Resource Expansion** (15-30 min)  
   - Increase max connections to 300
   - Scale to db-g1-standard-2 tier temporarily
   - Optimize connection pooling parameters

3. **Service Deployment Cleanup** (30-45 min)
   - Route 100% traffic to single latest revision
   - Remove old revisions causing resource contention
   - Eliminate 503 errors from deployment conflicts

4. **Enhanced Configuration** (45-60 min)
   - Deploy Issue #1278 specific environment variables
   - Extended timeouts for VPC connector latency
   - Restart services with optimized settings

**Success Criteria:**
- VPC connector: READY state, <70% utilization
- Database: <75% connection utilization, <2s response time
- Cloud Run: Single revision, zero 503 errors
- Health endpoints: Responding in <5 seconds

### Phase 2: Application Configuration Fixes (60-120 minutes)
**OWNER:** Development Team  
**PRIORITY:** P1 HIGH  
**BUSINESS IMPACT:** Service reliability and performance  

**Key Actions:**
1. **Database Configuration Enhancement**
   - VPC-aware connection management
   - Retry logic for infrastructure latency
   - Extended timeout handling

2. **WebSocket Infrastructure Hardening**
   - Progressive delays for Cloud Run environment
   - Infrastructure health monitoring
   - Enhanced async exception handling

3. **Import Path Standardization**
   - Convert relative to absolute imports
   - Prevent Cloud Run module resolution errors
   - Improve startup reliability

**Success Criteria:**
- Configuration validation: All environment variables set correctly
- WebSocket connections: Successful with authentication
- Service startup: No import or configuration errors

### Phase 3: Integration and Monitoring (120-180 minutes)
**OWNER:** Platform Team  
**PRIORITY:** P2 MEDIUM  
**BUSINESS IMPACT:** Long-term stability and observability  

**Key Actions:**
1. **Service Dependency Coordination**
   - Infrastructure-aware agent execution
   - Graceful degradation patterns
   - Health assessment scoring

2. **Enhanced Monitoring Setup**
   - Infrastructure health metrics
   - Error rate alerting (>10% triggers alert)
   - Capacity utilization tracking

3. **Agent Execution Resilience**
   - Pre-execution infrastructure checks
   - Degraded mode for low infrastructure health
   - Fallback execution patterns

**Success Criteria:**
- Monitoring: Metrics flowing, alerts configured
- Agent execution: Infrastructure-aware with fallbacks
- Service dependencies: Health checks operational

### Phase 4: Golden Path Validation (180-240 minutes)
**OWNER:** QA Team  
**PRIORITY:** P1 HIGH  
**BUSINESS IMPACT:** End-to-end user flow verification  

**Validation Tests:**
1. Infrastructure health: Database + Redis + VPC connectivity
2. WebSocket authentication: Token validation and connection success
3. Database performance: Query response time <2 seconds
4. Agent execution: End-to-end workflow completion

**Success Criteria:**
- All health endpoints responding
- WebSocket connections successful with authentication
- Zero 503 errors for 15 minutes continuous
- Golden Path validation passes all tests

## Execution Coordination

### Team Responsibilities

**Infrastructure Team Lead:**
- Execute Phase 1 scripts: VPC connector, Cloud SQL, deployment cleanup
- Monitor infrastructure metrics during remediation
- Execute rollback procedures if Phase 1 fails

**Development Team Lead:**
- Deploy enhanced configuration in Phase 2
- Validate application-level fixes
- Monitor service logs for configuration issues

**Platform Team Lead:**
- Set up enhanced monitoring in Phase 3
- Validate service integration patterns
- Coordinate cross-team communication

**QA Team Lead:**
- Execute golden path validation in Phase 4
- Validate end-to-end user workflows
- Confirm business impact resolution

### Risk Mitigation

**High Risk Items:**
1. **VPC Connector Recreation:** 15-30 minute outage possible
   - **Mitigation:** Use Terraform for consistency, only if scaling fails
2. **Database Configuration:** Could impact all operations
   - **Mitigation:** Test on secondary instance, immediate rollback ready
3. **Service Deployment:** New code could introduce issues
   - **Mitigation:** Separate configuration from code deployments

**Emergency Rollback:**
```bash
# Available at: infrastructure-remediation-scripts/emergency-rollback-issue-1278.sh
# Restores: VPC connector, database settings, service configuration
# Time: <15 minutes complete restoration
```

### Business Impact Timeline

| Time | Milestone | Business Impact |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 0 min | Remediation start | $500K+ ARR services offline |
| 15 min | VPC connector operational | Network connectivity restored |
| 30 min | Database scaled | Authentication systems operational |
| 45 min | Deployment cleanup | 503 errors eliminated |
| 60 min | Phase 1 complete | Infrastructure foundation restored |
| 120 min | Phase 2 complete | Service reliability enhanced |
| 180 min | Phase 3 complete | Monitoring and stability assured |
| 240 min | Golden Path validated | **$500K+ ARR services fully operational** |
