1. `admin_tool_execution.py` - Main execution module [✅ COMPLETED]
2. `dispatcher_core.py` - Core dispatcher logic [✅ COMPLETED]  
3. `tool_handlers.py` - Tool handler implementations [✅ COMPLETED]
4. `execution_helpers.py` - Execution helper functions [✅ COMPLETED]
5. `corpus_tool_handlers.py` - Corpus-specific handlers [✅ COMPLETED]
6. `validation.py` - Validation logic [✅ COMPLETED]
7. `dispatcher_helpers.py` - Dispatcher utilities [✅ COMPLETED]
8. `tool_handler_helpers.py` - Handler utilities [✅ COMPLETED]

### Modernization Requirements ACHIEVED
