# Frontend ChatSidebar Data Fix - August 18, 2025

## MISSION
Configure ChatSidebarHooks mocks to provide thread data so tests can find thread items.

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
- AuthGate mock is working and rendering children
- ChatSidebarHooks are mocked but returning empty arrays
- Tests can't find 'thread-item-thread-2' because no threads are rendered  
- Component shows "Loading conversations..." instead of thread list

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
1. Duplicate mocks: ChatSidebarHooks were mocked both in interaction.test.tsx (static) and setup.tsx (dynamic)
2. Static mocks with empty arrays were taking precedence over dynamic configuration
3. `isLoadingThreads` was not properly set to `false` in mock configuration
4. Thread items not rendered because hooks returned empty arrays

## FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Removed Duplicate Static Mocks ✅
- Removed static mock of ChatSidebarHooks from interaction.test.tsx
- Left dynamic configuration in setup.tsx as single source of truth

### 2. Enhanced Mock Configuration ✅
- Improved `configureChatSidebarHooks` method in setup.tsx
- Made threads configuration more explicit and reliable
- Ensured `isLoadingThreads: false` is set correctly

### 3. Test Verification
- Running test to verify thread-item-thread-2 can be found
- Checking that loading state is replaced with actual thread list

## STATUS: DEBUGGING DEEPER ISSUE
- [x] Remove duplicate mocks
- [x] Fix setup.tsx configuration  
- [x] Add debugging output
- [x] Fixed default mock isLoadingThreads: false
- [ ] Verify test passes - STILL FAILING

## DEBUGGING FINDINGS
1. ✅ configureChatSidebarHooks IS called with correct threads
2. ✅ Mock configurations show isLoadingThreads: false and 3 threads
3. ❌ Component STILL shows "Loading conversations..." 
4. ❌ No individual hook call logs visible
5. ❌ Component shows "0 conversations" in footer

## ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS
The configured mocks aren't being used by the component. Possible causes:
- `jest.clearAllMocks()` in beforeEach is clearing our configurations
- Timing issue: configuration happens after component render
- Mock implementations not properly applied to the actual hook calls

## NEXT FIX ATTEMPT
Try moving mock configuration BEFORE clearAllMocks() or using different mock strategy
