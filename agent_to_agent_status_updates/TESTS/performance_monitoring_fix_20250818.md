# Performance Monitoring Test Fix - NameError Resolution

## Task: Fix NameError in app/tests/performance/test_performance_monitoring.py

### Analysis
- **File**: `app/tests/performance/test_performance_monitoring.py`
- **Error**: NameError: name 'List' is not defined
- **Current State**: File contains 252 lines (under 300-line limit ✓)

### Investigation Results
1. **Existing Imports (Line 10)**: `from typing import List, Dict, Any` - List IS imported
2. **Import Analysis**: All imports appear correct:
   - `asyncio` ✓
   - `pytest` ✓ 
   - `time` ✓
   - `typing.List, Dict, Any` ✓
   - `unittest.mock` components ✓

### Issue Root Cause
Despite List being imported on line 10, the NameError suggests the import may not be recognized properly. This could be due to:
- Python version compatibility
- Import order issues
- Module loading timing

### Solution Strategy
- Ensure explicit and clear typing imports
- Verify import format follows best practices
- Confirm all typing annotations are properly accessible

### Status: COMPLETED
- [x] File analysis completed
- [x] Import investigation completed
- [x] Apply fix
- [x] Verify resolution

### ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED
**Real Issue**: NameError was in `app/monitoring/performance_monitor.py`, NOT the test file
- **Error Location**: Line 129 in performance_monitor.py
- **Missing Import**: `List` was missing from typing imports but used in function signature

### Applied Fix
**Primary Fix**: Added missing `List` import in performance_monitor.py
- **Before**: `from typing import Dict, Any, Optional`
- **After**: `from typing import Dict, Any, Optional, List`

**Secondary Fix**: Also cleaned up test file imports (though this wasn't the cause)
- **Test File**: `from typing import Dict, Any, List`

### Fix Details
1. **Root Cause**: performance_monitor.py line 129 used `List` in type hints without import
2. **Primary Resolution**: Added `List` to typing imports in performance_monitor.py
3. **Verification**: Import test successful - all typing imports now working
4. **Secondary**: Improved test file import order for consistency

### Verification
- All typing imports are present and properly formatted
- Import order follows Python best practices
- File remains under 300-line limit (252 lines)
- Functions remain under 8-line limit

### Resolution ✅
The NameError for 'List' has been successfully resolved:

**Files Fixed:**
1. `app/monitoring/performance_monitor.py` - Added missing `List` import (PRIMARY FIX)
2. `app/tests/performance/test_performance_monitoring.py` - Import order cleanup (SECONDARY)

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ Both files compile successfully
- ✅ Import test passes without errors
- ✅ All typing annotations now properly recognized
- ✅ No additional missing imports identified

**Compliance Check:**
- ✅ performance_monitor.py: Under 300 lines
- ✅ test_performance_monitoring.py: 252 lines (under 300-line limit)
- ✅ All functions remain under 8-line limit
