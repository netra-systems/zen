# Circuit Breaker Metrics Fix - 2025-08-18 13:14

## Problem Identified
AttributeError: 'AdaptiveCircuitBreaker' object has no attribute 'total_requests'

## Root Cause Analysis
The test `test_circuit_breaker_metrics_initialization` was trying to access attributes with incorrect names:
- `total_requests` (should be `total_calls`)
- `successful_requests` (should be `successful_calls`)
- `failed_requests` (should be `failed_calls`)

## Investigation Summary
1. **CircuitBreakerMetrics from reliability_types.py**: Has correct `total_calls` attribute
2. **AdaptiveCircuitBreaker from adaptive_circuit_breaker_core.py**: Has correct attributes:
   - `total_calls`, `successful_calls`, `failed_calls`, `slow_requests`
3. **Test file**: Using outdated attribute names

## Fix Applied
Updated test to use correct attribute names that match the actual implementation.

## Business Value
- **Segment**: All segments 
- **Business Goal**: System reliability and stability
- **Value Impact**: Ensures circuit breaker tests validate actual implementation
- **Revenue Impact**: Prevents reliability failures that could affect customer experience

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Single atomic fix applied to align test with actual implementation

## Fix Details
Updated test file: `app/tests/unit/test_circuit_breaker_core.py`

### Changes Made
1. `total_requests` → `total_calls` (6 occurrences)
2. `successful_requests` → `successful_calls` (2 occurrences)  
3. `failed_requests` → `failed_calls` (3 occurrences)

### Test Results
✅ All 30 tests in test_circuit_breaker_core.py now pass
✅ Specific failing test `test_circuit_breaker_metrics_initialization` now passes
✅ Attribute names now match AdaptiveCircuitBreaker implementation

## Technical Summary
The AdaptiveCircuitBreaker class correctly implements:
- `total_calls`, `successful_calls`, `failed_calls`, `slow_requests` attributes
- `_record_success()` and `_record_failure()` methods for metrics tracking

Tests were using outdated attribute names from an older interface design.
