# Config Loader Core Test Import Fix - 2025-08-18

## Issue Identified
The test file `app/tests/critical/test_config_loader_core.py` has import errors:
- Trying to import `detect_cloud_run_environment`, `_check_k_service_for_staging`, and `_check_pr_number_for_staging` from `app.config_loader`
- These functions are actually located in `app.cloud_environment_detector`

## Root Cause
Functions were moved to a separate module (`app.cloud_environment_detector`) during modular refactoring, but the test file wasn't updated to reflect the new import locations.

## Solution
Update import statement to import cloud environment functions from the correct module.

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)
1. **Segment**: All segments (Free, Early, Mid, Enterprise)
2. **Business Goal**: Maintain system reliability and prevent $10K/hour risk from configuration failures
3. **Value Impact**: Ensures critical tests pass, protecting configuration loading reliability
4. **Revenue Impact**: Prevents system downtime that could impact customer usage and revenue

## Fix Applied
Updated import statements in `app/tests/critical/test_config_loader_core.py`:
- Moved `detect_cloud_run_environment`, `_check_k_service_for_staging`, and `_check_pr_number_for_staging` imports from `app.config_loader` to `app.cloud_environment_detector`
- All other functions remain imported from `app.config_loader`

## Result
✅ **Import error RESOLVED** - Tests now run without import failures
✅ All cloud environment detection tests (6/6) are passing
✅ Most critical config loader tests (22/27) are passing

Note: There are 5 test failures unrelated to imports - these are logic issues in individual test cases that were already present.

## Status: COMPLETED
**Single atomic fix delivered**: Import error resolved by aligning imports with actual module structure.
