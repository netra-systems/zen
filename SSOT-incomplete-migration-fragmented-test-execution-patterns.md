**GitHub Issue:** #1145  
**GitHub Link:** https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/1145  
**Progress Tracker:** SSOT-incomplete-migration-fragmented-test-execution-patterns.md  

## Critical SSOT Violation: Fragmented Test Execution Patterns

### Problem Summary
Multiple test files are bypassing the unified test runner (SSOT), potentially missing critical validation steps and breaking SSOT compliance.

### Critical Files Identified
- `test_plans/rollback/test_emergency_rollback_validation.py:651`
- `test_plans/phase5/test_golden_path_protection_validation.py:563` 
- `test_plans/phase3/test_critical_configuration_drift_detection.py:524`
- Legacy BaseTestCase usage in `test_framework/base.py`

### Business Impact
- $500K+ ARR Golden Path functionality at risk
- Test execution inconsistency could miss critical failures
- SSOT compliance degradation (currently 94.5%)

## Work Progress

### ‚úÖ Phase 0: Discovery and Issue Creation
- [x] SSOT audit completed by sub-agent
- [x] GitHub issue #1145 created
- [x] Local progress tracker created

### üîÑ Phase 1: Discover and Plan Tests
- [ ] Find existing tests protecting against breaking changes
- [ ] Plan required unit/integration/e2e tests for SSOT refactor
- [ ] Document test coverage gaps

### ‚è≥ Phase 2: Execute Test Plan
- [ ] Create new SSOT validation tests (20% of work)
- [ ] Run and validate new tests

### ‚è≥ Phase 3: Plan SSOT Remediation
- [ ] Plan migration from legacy patterns to SSOT
- [ ] Identify safe migration path

### ‚è≥ Phase 4: Execute Remediation
- [ ] Implement SSOT migration
- [ ] Update test files to use unified test runner

### ‚è≥ Phase 5: Test Fix Loop
- [ ] Run all tests and fix any failures
- [ ] Ensure system stability maintained
- [ ] Validate no new breaking changes

### ‚è≥ Phase 6: PR and Closure
- [ ] Create PR when all tests pass
- [ ] Cross-link to close issue

## Notes
- Focus on non-docker tests only (unit, integration, e2e on staging GCP)
- Must maintain system stability throughout
- Prioritize Golden Path protection
