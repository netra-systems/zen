## 🔧 INFRASTRUCTURE TEAM CRITICAL ACTIONS

### Immediate Infrastructure Issues
1. **VPC Connector**: `staging-connector` connectivity failures
2. **Cloud SQL**: Database timeout and connection issues  
3. **SSL Certificates**: Load balancer configuration for *.netrasystems.ai
4. **Cloud Run**: Service deployment and resource allocation problems

### Infrastructure Team Tools Ready
- **Monitoring**: Real-time health monitoring during fixes
- **Validation**: Comprehensive post-fix validation with sign-off criteria
- **Documentation**: Complete technical requirements and action items
- **Communication**: Clear status protocols and escalation paths

## 📊 VALIDATION WORKFLOW (POST-INFRASTRUCTURE FIX)

### Infrastructure Team Confirmation
```bash
# Basic connectivity validation
curl -f https://staging.netrasystems.ai/health
curl -f https://staging.netrasystems.ai/health/infrastructure
curl -f https://api-staging.netrasystems.ai/health
```

### Development Team Comprehensive Validation
```bash
# Monitoring script execution
python scripts/monitor_infrastructure_health.py

# Full validation suite
python scripts/validate_infrastructure_fix.py

# Issue-specific testing
python -m pytest tests/e2e/ -k "issue_1278" -v -m staging
```

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All health endpoints return HTTP 200
- ✅ No VPC connectivity errors ("error -3" patterns eliminated)
- ✅ Database connections complete within timeout
- ✅ WebSocket services operational (no 500/503 errors)
- ✅ Validation script achieves 80%+ pass rate
