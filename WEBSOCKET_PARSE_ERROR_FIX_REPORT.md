# WebSocket Parse Error Fix Report

## Issue Summary
The WebSocket service was encountering parse errors (code 1003) when receiving messages that didn't strictly conform to the expected structure. The validation logic was too restrictive, requiring all messages to have both `type` and `payload` fields, which caused legitimate messages to be rejected.

## Root Cause
The `isBasicWebSocketMessage` validation function required:
1. Object to have a `type` field (string)
2. Object to have a `payload` field (object)

This was too restrictive because:
- System messages (ping/pong) may not have payloads
- Large messages have different structure
- Some message types have optional payloads

## Changes Made

### 1. Relaxed Basic Message Validation
**File:** `frontend/services/webSocketService.ts`

- Modified `isBasicWebSocketMessage` to only require `type` field
- Payload is now optional for basic validation

### 2. Improved Message Categorization
- Added better handling for different message types:
  - Agent messages: Require payload
  - Thread messages: Require payload  
  - System messages: Payload optional
  - Report messages: Payload optional
  - Large messages: Special structure handling

### 3. Enhanced Error Reporting
- Added `getInvalidMessageDetails` method to provide specific validation failure reasons
- Error messages now include detailed information about what validation failed
- Better logging of validation failures with metadata

### 4. Comprehensive Validation Flow
```typescript
validateWebSocketMessage(obj):
1. Check if object is valid
2. Check for large message types first (different structure)
3. Verify type field exists and is string
4. Categorize and validate based on message type
5. Handle unknown types gracefully with default payload
```

## Test Coverage
Created comprehensive tests in `frontend/__tests__/websocket-parse-error.test.tsx`:
- Parse error with code 1003 for invalid structure
- Missing required type/payload fields
- Malformed JSON handling

## Benefits
1. **More Resilient**: Handles various message formats without breaking
2. **Better Debugging**: Detailed error messages help identify issues
3. **Backward Compatible**: Still validates critical fields while being more permissive
4. **Production Ready**: Handles edge cases and unexpected message formats

## Validation Rules Summary

| Message Category | Type Field | Payload Field | Notes |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|-------|
| Agent Messages | Required | Required | Must have payload object |
| Thread Messages | Required | Required | Must have payload object |
| System Messages | Required | Optional | Ping/pong/auth don't need payload |
| Report Messages | Required | Optional | May or may not have payload |
| Large Messages | Special | Special | Different structure entirely |
| Unknown Types | Required | Auto-added | Empty payload added if missing |

## Next Steps
1. Monitor production for any new message types that need handling
2. Consider adding message schema versioning for future compatibility
3. Add metrics to track validation failures by type

## Testing Verification
The WebSocket service now properly:
- ✅ Accepts valid messages with required fields
- ✅ Rejects truly invalid messages with clear errors
- ✅ Handles edge cases gracefully
- ✅ Provides detailed error information for debugging
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing message flows
