=====================================

Validates both Issue #1278 resolution AND SSOT remediation deployment.
Tests staging deployment for:
1. Resolution of container startup failures (Issue #1278)
2. SSOT WebSocket Manager Factory legacy removal working correctly
3. No breaking changes from SSOT consolidation
