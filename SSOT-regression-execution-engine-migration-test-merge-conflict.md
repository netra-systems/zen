# SSOT Regression - Execution Engine Migration Test Merge Conflict

**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/netra-systems/netra-apex/issues/1057
**Priority:** P0 - IMMEDIATE
**Type:** Regression blocking Golden Path
**Created:** 2025-09-14

## Issue Summary
Unresolved merge conflict in `tests/unit/agents/test_execution_engine_migration_validation.py` from commit 7af8f5475. File violates SSOT testing patterns and blocks core agent execution engine validation.

## Business Impact
- **Revenue Impact:** $500K+ ARR - Core agent execution validation
- **Golden Path:** BLOCKS WebSocket agent events, user isolation, agent execution flow
- **Critical Function:** UserExecutionContext pattern validation affects core chat functionality

## SSOT Violations Identified
- [ ] Direct `unittest.mock` imports instead of `SSotMockFactory`
- [ ] No inheritance from `SSotBaseTestCase`
- [ ] Bypasses `tests/unified_test_runner.py`
- [ ] Direct imports without `IsolatedEnvironment`

## Files Involved
- `tests/unit/agents/test_execution_engine_migration_validation.py` - PRIMARY (merge conflict state)

## Process Tracking

### Step 0: Discovery âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] SSOT audit completed - identified critical regression
- [x] GitHub issue created: #1057
- [x] Progress tracker initialized

### Step 1: Discover and Plan Test ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] DISCOVER EXISTING: Find tests protecting against breaking changes
- [ ] PLAN ONLY: Plan required unit/integration/e2e tests

### Step 2: Execute Test Plan
- [ ] Create new SSOT tests (20% of effort)
- [ ] Validate existing tests (60% of effort)
- [ ] Run non-docker tests only

### Step 3: Plan Remediation
- [ ] Plan SSOT remediation approach

### Step 4: Execute Remediation
- [ ] Implement SSOT fixes

### Step 5: Test Fix Loop
- [ ] Prove changes maintain system stability
- [ ] Fix all test cases
- [ ] Run startup tests (non-docker)

### Step 6: PR and Closure
- [ ] Create Pull Request
- [ ] Cross-link issue for auto-closure

## Technical Notes
- File shows merge conflict markers from recent commit
- Core UserExecutionContext pattern validation at risk
- Agent execution engine migration incomplete
- SSOT testing infrastructure bypassed

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Merge conflict resolved
- [ ] Migrated to `SSotBaseTestCase`
- [ ] Uses `SSotMockFactory` for all mocks
- [ ] Tests pass via `tests/unified_test_runner.py`
- [ ] Golden Path agent execution flows validated
