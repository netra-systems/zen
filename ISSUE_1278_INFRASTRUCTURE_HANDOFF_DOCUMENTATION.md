   ```bash
   # Run this command to check VPC connector status
   gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors describe staging-connector \
     --region=us-central1 --project=netra-staging

   # Expected: State = "READY", Network = "staging-vpc", Instances = 2-10
   ```

2. **Cloud SQL Connectivity Validation:**
   ```bash
   # Check Cloud SQL instance health
   gcloud sql instances describe netra-staging-db --project=netra-staging

   # Expected: State = "RUNNABLE", Private IP enabled on staging-vpc
   ```

3. **Secret Manager Validation:**
   ```bash
   # Run automated infrastructure health check
   python scripts/infrastructure_health_check_issue_1278.py

   # Expected: All 10 secrets validated successfully
   ```

**Phase 2: Infrastructure Remediation (2-4 hours)**
- Fix identified VPC connector capacity issues
