## Summary

This PR addresses test infrastructure SSOT compliance issues discovered while investigating Issue #1278 staging infrastructure failures.

## Related Issue
Partially addresses #1278

## Root Cause Analysis

Through Five Whys analysis and comprehensive testing, we identified that Issue #1278 is caused by:

1. **Staging Infrastructure Down**: Backend returning 503 Service Unavailable
2. **DNS Not Configured**: `api-staging.netrasystems.ai` domain not resolving
3. **Terraform Config Already Correct**: Load balancer already has proper domain patterns

## Changes Made

### Test Infrastructure SSOT Compliance
- ‚úÖ Updated test runners to use `IsolatedEnvironment` instead of direct `os.environ` access
- ‚úÖ Ensures consistent environment management across test infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Maintains SSOT principles for environment variable access

## Current Staging Status

### ‚ùå Critical Issues Blocking Golden Path
- **Backend Services**: Returning 503 errors, service not starting properly  
- **DNS Resolution**: `api-staging.netrasystems.ai` not resolving (DNS not configured)
- **Business Impact**: Cannot validate $500K+ ARR golden path functionality

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- Core system components functional (locally)
- WebSocket infrastructure ready
- Agent system operational  
- Test framework validated

## Required Infrastructure Actions

To fully resolve Issue #1278, the infrastructure team needs to:

1. **Deploy/Restart Staging**: Deploy latest configuration to staging environment
2. **Configure DNS Records**:
   ```
   api-staging.netrasystems.ai ‚Üí [LOAD_BALANCER_IP]
   auth-staging.netrasystems.ai ‚Üí [LOAD_BALANCER_IP]
   ```
3. **Verify SSL Certificates**: Ensure certificates cover `*.netrasystems.ai` domains
4. **Health Check Configuration**: Adjust for 600s startup timeouts

## Testing Performed

- ‚úÖ SSOT compliance validation
- ‚úÖ Import verification for modified modules
- ‚úÖ Unit test execution
- ‚ö†Ô∏è E2E tests blocked by staging unavailability

## Next Steps

1. Infrastructure team to deploy/fix staging environment
2. Configure DNS records for api-staging subdomain
3. Re-run golden path validation once staging is accessible
4. Close Issue #1278 once staging validated

## Business Context

This work is critical for protecting $500K+ ARR dependent on golden path functionality (login ‚Üí AI responses).
