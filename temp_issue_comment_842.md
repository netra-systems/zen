## Test Run Update - Unit Test Failures Confirmed

**Test Execution Date:** 2025-09-13 22:14

During integration test run, unit test failures were confirmed in both netra_backend and auth_service:

### Test Execution Results
- **netra_backend unit tests:** FAILED (return code: 1, duration: 16.23s)
- **auth_service unit tests:** FAILED (return code: 1)
- **Integration tests:** SKIPPED due to fast-fail mode triggered by unit test failures

### Five Whys Analysis
1. **Why are integration tests not running?** Fast-fail mode activated due to unit test failures
2. **Why are unit tests failing?** Multiple issues in both netra_backend and auth_service test suites
3. **Why are both service test suites failing?** Likely related to SSOT violations and configuration issues
4. **Why do SSOT violations affect unit tests?** Fragmented implementations cause import conflicts and validation failures
5. **Why is this critical?** Unit test failures prevent validation of the Golden Path user flow ($500K+ ARR dependency)

### Current Blocking Status
- **Priority:** P1 - blocking all integration testing
- **Business Impact:** Cannot validate chat functionality which represents 90% of platform value
- **System Health:** Unit test failures indicate fundamental infrastructure issues

### Related Issues
- Issue #885: SSOT WebSocket Manager fragmentation confirmed during same test run
- Multiple SSOT compliance warnings detected

### Immediate Action Required
1. Detailed investigation of specific unit test failure reasons
2. SSOT consolidation completion (addressing Issue #885)
3. Coordination of fixes to ensure both issues are resolved together

### Next Steps
- Spawn sub-agent to investigate specific test failures
- Plan coordinated remediation addressing both SSOT violations and unit test failures
- Execute fixes and validate complete test suite passes
