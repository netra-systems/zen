# Critical WebSocket Manager Fix - Production Bug Resolution

## Critical Issue Fixed

### 1. **CRITICAL BUG: Broadcast Method AttributeError**
- **Location**: `app/ws_manager.py:320`
- **Impact**: Application crash whenever broadcast is called
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect attribute access - `connection.send_json()` instead of `connection.websocket.send_json()`
- **Affected Services**: 
  - `generation_service.py` - Job status updates
  - `corpus_service.py` - Corpus operations
  - `synthetic_data_service.py` - Data generation status
- **Fix Applied**: Changed to `connection.websocket.send_json()`

## Additional Improvements Applied

### 2. Connection Limit Per User
- Added `MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_USER = 5` to prevent memory exhaustion attacks
- Automatically closes oldest connection when limit exceeded
- Prevents malicious users from opening unlimited connections

### 3. Enhanced Broadcast Reliability
- Added connection state validation before sending
- Proper handling of disconnected WebSockets
- Automatic cleanup of dead connections during broadcast
- Returns success/failure statistics for monitoring

### 4. Improved Shutdown Handling
- Fixed issue with attempting to cancel already-done tasks
- Proper cleanup of all connection tracking structures
- Graceful handling of connection closure errors

### 5. Error Recovery and Statistics
- Added comprehensive error counting per connection
- Tracks total messages sent and errors
- Better logging for debugging connection issues

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite in `app/tests/test_websocket_manager_fixes.py`:
- ✅ Broadcast uses correct WebSocket attribute
- ✅ Handles disconnected WebSockets properly
- ✅ Gracefully handles send errors
- ✅ Enforces connection limit per user
- ✅ Broadcasts to multiple users correctly
- ✅ Adds timestamps to messages
- ✅ Preserves existing timestamps

## Production Impact

This fix resolves a critical production bug that would cause the application to crash whenever:
- A generation job updates its status
- Corpus operations broadcast updates
- Synthetic data generation sends status updates

The bug was in production code and actively being triggered by multiple services.

## Deployment Notes

1. No database migrations required
2. No API changes - backward compatible
3. Existing WebSocket connections will continue to work
4. New connections will benefit from improved reliability

## Monitoring Recommendations

Monitor the following after deployment:
- WebSocket connection counts per user
- Broadcast success/failure rates
- Connection error rates
- Memory usage (should be more stable with connection limits)
