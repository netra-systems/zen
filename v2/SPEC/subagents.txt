subagents:1:0:0: Spec: PRIMARY GOAL: Dedicated SubAgent Specification: 

subagents:1:0:0:0 Intent: The point of SubAgents is to manage it’s own context and protect the primary context from getting cluttered.
subagents:1:0:0:1: Follow best practices for SubAgents including having clear entry and exit conditions.
subagents:1:0:0:2: The End to end flow from frontend to backend and back must work. Code must be PRODUCTION grade and include all concepts needed to the best of your ability.
subagents:1:0:0:3: SubAgents use prompt templates to communicate with an LLM. They are LLM based always. Always include the complete prompt template and LLM usage.

subagents:1:0:1: Agents:
subagents:1:0:1:0: Keep ALL existing Agents. Only Update Agents. Keep files where they are. Implement all updates as needed.
subagents:1:0:1:1: SupervisorAgent.
subagents:1:0:1:2: TriageSubAgent: The triage process is its own SubAgent.
subagents:1:0:1:3: DataSubAgent: Data tools, enrichment type tools, etc. process.
subagents:1:0:1:4: OptimizationsCoreSubAgent: Takes data from DataSubAgent and is the initial “Core” of everything between DataSubAgent and ActionsToMeetGoalsSubAgent.
subagents:1:0:1:5: ActionsToMeetGoalsSubAgent: Takes all concepts from OptimizationsCoreSubAgent and formulates everything to do with tangible actions and changes and supply configs etc. to make it happen.
subagents:1:0:1:6: ReportingAgent: Summarizes overall results and reports to users.

subagents:1:0:2: General:

subagents:1:0:2:0: Validate all existing tools and functions are KEPT. This is only about ADDING and organizing subagent concepts. SubAgents may share many tools if needed.  Modular concepts. Expect other subagents to be in the future.

subagents:1:0:2:2: WS Integrations: Validate all Agent WS and communication end to end.
subagents:1:0:2:4: Check Lifecycle and shut down concepts
subagents:1:0:2:5: Every SubAgent has all required fields to operate completed. E.g. its prompt definition etc. all completely filled out.
