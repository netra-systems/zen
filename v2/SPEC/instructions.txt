Instructions: 
0:1: Triage:
0:1:0:1: The name of the company is Netra.
0:1:0:1: Read: As BACKGROUND CONTEXT ONLY: other files in Spec/*
0:1:0:2: Read: As BACKGROUND CONTEXT ONLY: “/plans/{*}-plan.md” documents. 
0:1:0:3: CRITICAL: Consider coherence with all BACKGROUND CONTEXT including existing specs and plans.
0:1:0:4: Read and be prepared to discuss all existing relevant code and system concepts. 
0:1:0:5: Reflect on work in progress if relevant.
0:1:0:6: ACTION only the defined ACTION: spec. this is the {spec_name}

0:1:1: Project Conventions:
0:1:1:0: Types: 
0:1:1:0:0: frontend: types/index.ts. 
0:1:1:0:1: backend: schemas.py. 
0:1:1:0:2: ALWAYS use existing or add new types in (“0:1:1:0:0:”, “0:1:1:0:1”).
0:1:1:1: Use single sources of truth. Every unique concept is only defined once and then references the rest of the places. E.g. for each frontend concept, e.g. Context, Hooks, Store, etc. etc. MUST be only ONE
0:1:1:3: Frontend: Imports: Use tsconfig.json, named exports (export const ...)
All import paths must be absolute using the @/ alias from tsconfig.
All imports use { item } over defaults.
0:1:1:4: Always use classes (interfaces). All functions must be inside of classes.
0:1:1:5: Always import at class level.
0:1:1:6: Frontend: Always prefer typescript classes over react concepts. The core logic is always in typescript, react is just the view related concepts when it make sense.

0:1:1:4: Connection between services look at shared/schema.json for alignment.
0:1:1:5: Use lowercase for settings in python. e.g. settings.var_name
0:1:1:6: Check existing folders. e.g. check if services folder exists before making a services folder

0:1:1: Commercial context outside of code: The intention of the overall business is to offer the most intelligent optimization agents in the world. All actions are in support of this overarching goal.
0:2: Plan: Make a plan to execute the detailed instructions {spec_name}:1:0 ({spec_name}:“1:0”). Look at all items from 1:0 through 1:0:0 (if existing) 1:0:0:0 (if existing) through to the end. Plan to fix potential new bugs introduced from changes and related classes of issues at the same time. Zoom in and out and look at it from a spherical point of view.  Save the plan to “/plans/{*}-plan.md”.
0:3: Review: Review the plan and the required concepts, including very careful and thoughtful integration with all existing code. Update “/plans/{*}-plan.md”.
0:4: Background: Think deeply and carefully to architect and implement holistic, complete, and working components and concepts. The code must be scalable, clean, robust, reliable, and easy to ready for human engineers.  Update “/plans/{*}-plan.md”.
0:5: Go: After planning, execute all steps. Complete all items to consider your overall task complete. Keep rerunning tests until they pass. 
0:6: Validate work. CRITICAL:  
0:6:1 Validate and protect against regressions. 
0:6:2: Validate and protect against duplicate code. 
0:6:3:  Validate and protect against repetition, especially in newly introduced code. 
0:6:4: Use as strong type checking and types as possible. 
0:6:5: Validate up to five (5) steps in any direction in the system, especially with data marshalling and unmarshalling. E.g. double check concepts are only being cast as types an appropriate amount of times. 
0:7: SUPER CRITICAL: Code must be coherent and well integrated with the entire Netra system application context.
0:7:0: Limit coherence reflection to be at most 30 most relevant categories and 100 items total.
0:7:1: Scope: Keep scope of “{spec_name}:1:0” changes in mind. Focus on making changes strictly relevant to the scope described in “1:0” as the primary goal and limit side effects and focus on related changes to the scope of “1:0” only.
0:7:2: Every added line, function, file, class, etc: Use 0:1:1: Project Conventions.
0:7:3: Once completed “{spec_name}:1:0”: 
0:7:3:0: Update docs: Update “/docs/{spec_name}-doc.md”
0:7:3:1: Update shared/schema.json for alignment.
0:7:3:2: Limit scope creep. Focus on what's actually needed to get to the next step in the system only. Use existing dependencies as much as possible.
0:7:3:3: For areas with mature code limit total changes at any single time.
0:7:3:4: Keep the overall project structure as is.
0:7:3:5: Keep names the same unless expressly refactoring

Remember: 0:7.  Remember: 0:1 to 0:7 including all sub items. Limit to 20 subitems.
Remember: {spec_name}:1:0:* through {spec_name}:1:*:* Limit to 20 subitems.
All other specs are for background context and coherence. Scope to an implment {spec_name} only.
