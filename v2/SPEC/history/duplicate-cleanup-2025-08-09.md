# Duplicate Code Cleanup - 2025-08-09

## Summary

Cleaned up duplicate and conflicting implementations across the codebase, keeping only the best versions.

## Duplicates Removed

### 1. WebSocket Route Implementation
- **Removed**: `app/routes/ws.py`
- **Kept**: `app/routes/websockets.py`
- **Reason**: The websockets.py implementation is more complete, properly integrated with the app, and uses the correct authentication pattern with query parameters.

### 2. Database Migration Setup
- **Removed**: `app/migration/` folder and its contents
- **Kept**: `app/alembic/` folder
- **Reason**: The run_migrations.py script references app/alembic, making the migration folder redundant.

## Inconsistencies Found But Not Fixed

### Database Session Dependencies
Found three different implementations:
1. `app/db/postgres.py::get_async_db()` - Most widely used, has error handling
2. `app/db/session.py::get_db_session()` - Uses context manager pattern
3. `app/dependencies.py::get_db_session()` - Gets factory from request state

**Current Status**: Mixed usage across the codebase. Recommended to standardize on `get_async_db()` from postgres.py as it's the most robust implementation.

### WebSocket Test Files
Found multiple WebSocket test files:
- `app/tests/test_websocket.py`
- `integration_tests/test_websocket.py`
- `integration_tests/test_websocket_connection.py`

**Current Status**: Left as-is since they may test different aspects of WebSocket functionality.

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Removed unused imports**: The deleted ws.py file had imports from non-existent `app.auth.services`
2. **Eliminated path conflicts**: Removed WebSocket route that expected token in path (`/ws/{token}`)
3. **Reduced confusion**: Single source of truth for migrations and WebSocket handling

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Standardize database session dependency**: Use `get_async_db()` from `app/db/postgres.py` consistently
2. **Consider consolidating test files**: Review if all three WebSocket test files are necessary
3. **Update imports**: Any code importing from deleted files needs updating (though none were found in active use)

## Files Modified/Deleted

- Deleted: `app/routes/ws.py`
- Deleted: `app/migration/` (entire directory)
- No import updates were needed as the deleted files weren't actively imported
