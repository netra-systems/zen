Configuration Validation:
       * What: Implement a check to validate the application's configuration (app/config.py) on startup.
       * Why: This would ensure that all required settings are present and have valid values (e.g.,
         checking if URLs are well-formed, or that required API keys are not empty). This can prevent
         runtime errors caused by misconfiguration.

   2. External Service Connectivity:
       * What: Add checks to verify the connectivity to all external services the application depends on.
       * Why: Your application uses Redis, ClickHouse, and an external LLM provider. A startup check could
         attempt to connect to each of these services and report an error if any of them are unavailable.
         This would provide a clear and immediate signal that a dependency is down, rather than discovering
          it through a failed user request.

   3. API Key Validation:
       * What: For services that require API keys (like the LLM provider), you could add a check to make a
         simple, inexpensive API call to validate that the keys are correct and have the necessary
         permissions.
       * Why: This would catch issues with invalid or expired API keys at startup, which is much better
         than failing in the middle of a user's workflow.

   4. File System Permissions:
       * What: If your application needs to write to specific directories (e.g., for logs, file uploads,
         or temporary files), you could add a check to verify that these directories exist and that the
         application has the necessary write permissions.
       * Why: This would prevent runtime errors when the application tries to write a file to a location
         that doesn't exist or isn't writable.

   5. Tool and Agent Integrity Check:
       * What: You could implement a check to verify the integrity of your agent's tools. This could
         involve checking if the tool's dependencies are met and if the tool's configuration is valid.
       * Why: As you add more tools to your agents, this check would ensure that a misconfigured or broken
         tool doesn't bring down the entire agent system.
