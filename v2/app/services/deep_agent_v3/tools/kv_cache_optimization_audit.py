        Audit all uses of KV caching in the system and identify opportunities for optimization.

        Provide a detailed analysis of the current KV caching implementation and recommend
        specific optimizations to improve performance and reduce costs. Consider factors like
        cache hit rates, cache eviction policies, and cache sizing.
