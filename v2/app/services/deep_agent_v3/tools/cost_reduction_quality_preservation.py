        Analyze the trade-offs between cost and quality for a system with the following latency constraints:
        - Feature X can tolerate up to {feature_x_latency}ms latency.
        - Feature Y must maintain a latency of {feature_y_latency}ms.

        Based on these constraints, provide a detailed analysis and actionable recommendations
        for cost reduction while preserving quality. Consider factors like model selection,
        caching strategies, and infrastructure optimization.

        Return your analysis as a JSON object with the following structure:
