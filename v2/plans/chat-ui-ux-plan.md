# Chat UI/UX Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to implement the chat UI/UX as specified in `chat_ui_ux.txt`.

## 1. Component Scaffolding

Create the basic file structure for the new chat components. This will include:

-   `components/chat/ChatWindow.tsx`: The main container for the chat interface.
-   `components/chat/ChatHeader.tsx`: The header component, which will display the sub-agent name and status.
-   `components/chat/MessageList.tsx`: The component that will display the list of messages.
-   `components/chat/MessageItem.tsx`: The component for a single message in the list.
-   `components/chat/RawJsonView.tsx`: The component to display the raw JSON data.

## 2. State Management

Set up state management for the chat interface. This will involve:

-   Creating a new store slice for the chat.
-   Defining the state shape, including messages, sub-agent status, and errors.
-   Creating actions and reducers to update the state.

## 3. WebSocket Integration

Connect the UI to the backend via WebSockets to handle real-time communication. This will include:

-   Creating a WebSocket service to manage the connection.
-   Handling the different message types from the `WebSocketMessage` schema.
-   Dispatching actions to update the state based on the received messages.

## 4. UI Implementation

Build the UI for each component, adhering to the `chat_ui_ux.txt` spec. This will include:

-   Implementing the header with the sub-agent name, status, and tools.
-   Rendering the list of messages, including user messages, agent messages, and tool messages.
-   Displaying the message content, references, and a collapsible raw JSON view.
-   Styling the components to match the design specifications.

## 5. "Alive" UI

Add subtle animations and transitions to make the UI feel more alive and responsive. This will include:

-   Animating new messages as they appear.
-   Adding loading indicators to show when the agent is processing.
-   Using transitions to smoothly show and hide UI elements.

## 6. Error Handling

Display errors from the backend. This will include:

-   Displaying a notification or an inline message when an error occurs.
-   Providing a way for the user to dismiss the error.

## 7. Stop Functionality

Implement the "Stop" button to terminate the agent process. This will involve:

-   Adding a "Stop" button to the UI.
-   Sending a `stop_agent` message to the backend when the button is clicked.

## 8. Testing

Write unit and integration tests for the new components and functionality. This will include:

-   Writing unit tests for each component.
-   Writing integration tests for the chat feature as a whole.
