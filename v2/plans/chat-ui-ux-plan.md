# Chat UI/UX Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to implement the new UI/UX features for the chat interface, as described in `SPEC/chat_ui_ux.txt`.

## 1. Refactor `Chat.tsx`

*   **Create a new `Message` component:** This component will be responsible for rendering individual messages, including user messages, agent messages, and system messages. This will make the `Chat.tsx` component cleaner and easier to manage.
*   **Collapsible Raw JSON:** The `Message` component will handle the display of the message content, sender information (avatar, name), and timestamp. It will also include a collapsible section to display raw JSON data for agent messages, as requested in `chat_ui_ux:1:0:9`.

## 2. Update `types/chat.ts`

*   **Extend `WebSocketMessage`:** Add new fields to the `WebSocketMessage` interface to support the new UI features, such as `sub_agent_name` and `sub_agent_state`.
*   **Create `Message` Type:** Create a new `Message` type that can be used to represent all types of messages in the chat, including user, agent, and system messages.

## 3. Enhance `useWebSocket.ts`

*   **Handle New Message Types:** Update the `useWebSocket` hook to handle the new `WebSocketMessage` types and update the chat state accordingly.
*   **Parse Agent Information:** Add logic to parse the `sub_agent_name` and `sub_agent_state` from the WebSocket messages and store them in the chat state.

## 4. Implement Header and Status Display

*   **Create `Header` Component:** Create a new `Header` component to display the `sub_agent_name` as the primary header and the `sub_agent_state` as the secondary status, as requested in `chat_ui_ux:1:0:1` and `chat_ui_ux:1:0:1:0`.

## 5. Add "Stop" Button

*   **Implement "Stop" Functionality:** Add a "Stop" button to the UI that sends a "stop" message to the WebSocket server to terminate the current agent process, as requested in `chat_ui_ux:1:0:10`.

## 6. Improve UI/UX

*   **Subtle Animations:** Use subtle animations and transitions to make the UI feel more "alive," as requested in `chat_ui_ux:1:0:8`.
*   **Error Handling:** Add error handling and display error messages to the user in a clear and concise way, as requested in `chat_ui_ux:1:0:4`.

## 7. Add Tests

*   **Component and Feature Tests:** Create new tests for the new components and features to ensure they work as expected and to prevent regressions, as requested in `chat_ui_ux:1:0:12`.
