# WebSocket Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing WebSocket functionality in the application.

## 1. Analysis

The existing code provides a good foundation for the WebSocket implementation. It includes a `WebSocketManager` class that handles the connection and disconnection of clients, as well as the sending of messages to clients. The `websockets_router` defines a WebSocket endpoint that handles incoming WebSocket connections.

However, there are a few areas that need to be improved to meet the requirements of the specification.

-   **JSON double wrapping:** The `handle_message` function in `websockets.py` parses the incoming data as a `WebSocketMessage` object. The `send_to_client` and `broadcast` methods in `ws_manager.py` then convert the `WebSocketMessage` object back to a dictionary before sending it to the client. This double wrapping of the JSON object is unnecessary and can be avoided.
-   **Error handling:** The error handling in the `handle_message` function can be improved. The current implementation catches all exceptions and sends a generic error message to the client. It would be better to provide more specific error messages to the client.
-   **State management:** The `WebSocketManager` class stores the active connections in a dictionary. This is a good start, but it would be better to use a more robust state management solution, such as Redis, to store the active connections. This would make the application more scalable and resilient.
-   **Testing:** There are no tests for the WebSocket functionality. It is important to add tests to ensure that the WebSocket functionality is working correctly and to prevent regressions.

## 2. Planning

Based on the analysis, a detailed plan will be created that outlines the steps required to implement the WebSocket functionality. The plan will include the following:

-   **Refactor `handle_message` function:** Refactor the `handle_message` function to avoid the JSON double wrapping.
-   **Improve error handling:** Improve the error handling in the `handle_message` function to provide more specific error messages to the client.
-   **Refactor `WebSocketManager`:** Refactor the `WebSocketManager` to use a more robust state management solution, such as Redis, to store the active connections.
-   **Add tests:** Add tests for the WebSocket functionality to ensure that it is working correctly and to prevent regressions.
-   **Integrate with authentication and agent communication:** Integrate the WebSocket functionality with the existing authentication and agent communication mechanisms.

## 3. Implementation

The implementation of the WebSocket functionality will be carried out in the following phases:

-   **Phase 1: Refactor `handle_message` function:** In this phase, the `handle_message` function will be refactored to avoid the JSON double wrapping.
-   **Phase 2: Improve error handling:** In this phase, the error handling in the `handle_message` function will be improved to provide more specific error messages to the client.
-   **Phase 3: Refactor `WebSocketManager`:** In this phase, the `WebSocketManager` will be refactored to use a more robust state management solution, such as Redis, to store the active connections.
-   **Phase 4: Add tests:** In this phase, tests will be added for the WebSocket functionality.
-   **Phase 5: Integration with authentication and agent communication:** In this phase, the WebSocket functionality will be integrated with the existing authentication and agent communication mechanisms.

## 4. Validation

Once the implementation is complete, it will be validated to ensure that it meets all the requirements of the specification. This will involve the following:

-   **Unit Testing:** Unit tests will be created to test the individual components of the WebSocket functionality.
-   **Integration Testing:** Integration tests will be created to test the integration of the WebSocket functionality with the other components of the application.
-   **End-to-End Testing:** End-to-end tests will be created to test the complete WebSocket functionality from the frontend to the backend.

## 5. Documentation

The implementation of the WebSocket functionality will be documented in the project's documentation. This will include the following:

-   **API Documentation:** The WebSocket API will be documented, including the available endpoints and the format of the messages.
-   **User Guide:** A user guide will be created to explain how to use the WebSocket functionality.
-   **Developer Guide:** A developer guide will be created to explain how to extend the WebSocket functionality.
