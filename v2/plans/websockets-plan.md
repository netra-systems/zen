# Websockets Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the steps to implement a robust and scalable websocket system for Netra, following the specifications in `ws.txt`.

## 1. Backend Implementation

### 1.1. WebSocket Manager
- Create a `ws_manager.py` to handle all websocket connections. This will be a singleton class to ensure a single source of truth for all connections.
- The manager will handle incoming connections, disconnections, and message broadcasting.
- It will also handle authentication of connections, ensuring that only authenticated users can connect.

### 1.2. WebSocket Routes
- Create a new route in `app/routes/ws.py` to handle websocket connections.
- This route will be responsible for upgrading the HTTP connection to a websocket connection and passing it to the `ws_manager`.

### 1.3. Configuration
- The backend will provide a configuration endpoint for the frontend to discover the websocket URL. This will be done in `app/config.py`.

### 1.4. JSON Handling
- All messages sent and received will be in JSON format.
- Pydantic models will be used to validate the structure of the messages.

## 2. Frontend Implementation

### 2.1. WebSocket Service
- Create a `services/websocket.ts` to handle the websocket connection.
- This service will be responsible for establishing the connection, sending and receiving messages, and handling connection errors.
- The service will use the configuration from the backend to discover the websocket URL.

### 2.2. State Management
- The websocket connection will be managed in the application state.
- The connection will be established on application load and will be persistent.
- The connection will be resilient to component re-renders and lifecycle changes.

### 2.3. Message Handling
- All messages will be handled through the websocket service.
- The messages will be typed using the types defined in `types/index.ts`.

## 3. Testing

### 3.1. Backend
- Unit tests will be written for the `ws_manager` and the websocket routes.
- Integration tests will be written to test the end-to-end functionality of the websocket system.

### 3.2. Frontend
- Unit tests will be written for the websocket service.
- End-to-end tests will be written to test the websocket functionality in the browser.

## 4. Coherence and Integration

- The websocket implementation will be coherent with the existing user authentication system.
- The agent communications will be integrated with the websocket system.
- The `shared/schema.json` will be updated to reflect the new websocket message types.
