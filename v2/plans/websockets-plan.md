# WebSocket Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to implement a robust and reliable WebSocket communication system between the frontend and backend.

## 1. Analyze Existing Code

*   **Backend:** Review `app/websockets.py` and `app/ws_manager.py` to understand the current WebSocket implementation.
*   **Frontend:** Examine the `frontend/` directory to understand how WebSockets are currently being used.

## 2. Backend Implementation

*   **Single Source of Truth:** Ensure `app/ws_manager.py` is the single source of truth for managing WebSocket connections.
*   **JSON Messaging:** Modify `app/websockets.py` to handle JSON objects exclusively. This includes:
    *   Serializing outgoing messages to JSON.
    *   Deserializing incoming messages from JSON.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging, especially for connection rejections.
*   **Langchain Integration:** If Langchain streams are used, ensure they are correctly parsed into JSON before being sent over the WebSocket.

## 3. Frontend Implementation

*   **Stateful Connection:** Implement a stateful and persistent WebSocket connection that is established on application load.
*   **Resilient Connection:** Ensure the connection is resilient to component re-renders and other lifecycle changes.
*   **Type-Safe Messaging:** Use TypeScript types for all WebSocket messages to ensure type safety.

## 4. Testing

*   **Integration Tests:** Create a new integration test file, `integration_tests/test_websockets.py`, to test the end-to-end functionality.
*   **Test Coverage:** The tests will cover:
    *   Connection establishment and authentication.
    *   Sending and receiving JSON messages.
    *   Error handling and connection rejection.
    *   Connection persistence.
