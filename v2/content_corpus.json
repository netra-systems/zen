      "Explain the concept of a 'vector database'.",
      "A vector database is a specialized database designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors, which are mathematical representations of data like text or images. It's essential for tasks like semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)."

      "What's the difference between a 'tool' and a 'function' in the context of LLM agents?",
      "In the context of LLM agents, a 'tool' is a capability the agent can use to interact with the outside world, like a search engine or a calculator. A 'function' is a specific implementation of a tool, like a Python function that calls a weather API."
