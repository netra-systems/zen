      "Hey, what's a 'virtual machine' in simple terms?",
      "A virtual machine (VM) is like a computer within a computer. It's a software-based emulation of a physical computer system. This means you can run multiple 'virtual' operating systems, like Windows or Linux, all on one physical server, each isolated from the others."

      "Can you explain what a neural network is in a simple way?",
      "Sure! Imagine a neural network as a computer system inspired by the human brain. It's designed to recognize patterns and learn from data, much like how our brains learn. It consists of interconnected 'nodes' (like neurons) organized in layers, which process information to make decisions or predictions, for example, identifying objects in images or understanding speech."

      "Hey, what's a 'large language model'?",
      "A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence program designed to understand and generate human-like text. They are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to perform tasks like translation, summarization, answering questions, and even creative writing."

      "Given the following context, please answer the question: What is the main purpose of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Cheops mission?\n\nContext: The CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (Cheops) is a European Space Agency (ESA) mission launched in 2019. Its primary objective is not to discover new exoplanets, but rather to perform high-precision follow-up observations of known exoplanets. By precisely measuring the tiny dips in starlight as planets pass in front of their host stars (transits), Cheops aims to accurately determine the radii of these planets. This information, combined with mass measurements from other instruments, allows scientists to calculate the planets' densities, providing crucial insights into their composition and formation.",

      "Context: The Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is the closest large spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and is part of the Local Group. It is named after the constellation of Andromeda, where it appears in the night sky. The latest estimations place its distance from Earth at approximately 2.537 million light-years. Andromeda is the largest galaxy of the Local Group, which also includes the Triangulum Galaxy and about 30 other smaller galaxies. It is currently approaching the Milky Way at a speed of about 110 kilometers per second, and the two galaxies are expected to collide in approximately 4.5 billion years, eventually merging to form a single, larger galaxy.\n\nQuestion: How far is the Andromeda Galaxy from Earth according to the provided information?",
      "The Andromeda Galaxy is approximately 2.537 million light-years from Earth."
