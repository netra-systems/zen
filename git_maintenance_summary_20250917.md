# Git Repository Maintenance Summary - 2025-09-17

## Status: ✅ Analysis Complete - Ready for Manual Execution

### Work Completed
1. **✅ Git Status Analysis**
   - Branch: develop-long-lived (current)
   - Local commits: 49 ahead of remote
   - Remote commits: 3 behind local
   - Working tree: Clean (no uncommitted changes)

2. **✅ Remote Changes Analysis**
   - Identified 3 remote commits to integrate
   - All changes are low-risk: 2 documentation files + 1 duplicate import fix
   - No high-risk conflicts expected

3. **✅ Merge Preparation**
   - Created detailed merge resolution log: `git_merge_resolution_log_20250917.md`
   - Analyzed file differences and potential conflicts
   - Prepared conflict resolution strategies

4. **✅ GitHub Issues Check Preparation**
   - Unable to access GitHub API directly due to approval requirements
   - Prepared manual steps for checking stale "actively-being-worked-on" labels

## Remaining Manual Steps

### 1. GitHub Issues Cleanup
```bash
# Check for issues with "actively-being-worked-on" label
gh issue list --label "actively-being-worked-on" --json number,title,updatedAt

# For any issues not updated in 20+ minutes, remove the label:
gh issue edit [ISSUE_NUMBER] --remove-label "actively-being-worked-on"
```

### 2. Git Merge Execution
```bash
# Safe merge using merge strategy (not rebase)
git pull --no-rebase origin develop-long-lived

# If conflicts occur, follow resolution plan in git_merge_resolution_log_20250917.md
```

### 3. Post-Merge Validation
```bash
# Verify SSOT fix works correctly
python test_issue_942_fix.py

# Confirm clean git state
git status

# Check that no tests were broken by merge
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --fast-fail
```

## Key Findings

### Remote Changes to Integrate
1. **issue_984_resolution_comment.txt** - Documentation file (NEW)
2. **issue_1277_comment.txt** - Documentation file (NEW)  
3. **netra_backend/app/agents/data_sub_agent/__init__.py** - Remove duplicate import (lines 25 and 28)
4. **test_issue_942_fix.py** - Update SSOT validation test logic

### Safety Assessment
- **Risk Level: LOW** ✅
- All changes are documentation or minor bug fixes
- No breaking changes identified
- Working tree is clean, safe for merge
- Merge strategy chosen over rebase for safety

## Files Created
1. `git_merge_resolution_log_20250917.md` - Detailed merge plan and conflict resolution guide
2. `git_maintenance_summary_20250917.md` - This summary document

## Next Actions
The repository is ready for safe merge execution. All analysis and preparation work is complete. The manual steps above can be executed safely following the documented procedures.
