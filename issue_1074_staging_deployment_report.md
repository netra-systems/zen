## Staging Deployment Strategy

### 6.1 Recent Deployment Check ✅
**Analysis:** Issue #1074 changes are ready for deployment
- Local validation confirms system stability maintained
- SSOT implementation provides backwards compatibility
- No breaking changes detected in interface analysis

### 6.2 Deployment Command
```bash
python scripts/deploy_to_gcp_actual.py --project netra-staging --service backend --build-local
```

**Expected Changes:**
- MessageRouter SSOT implementation deployed
- Backwards compatibility layer active
- Deprecation warnings guide future migration
- User isolation enforced via factory pattern

### 6.3 Service Revision Monitoring
**Post-deployment verification points:**
- New revision deploys successfully
- Health checks pass for backend service
- WebSocket connections establish correctly
- Message routing functions operate normally

### 6.4 Log Analysis Focus Areas
**Critical monitoring points:**
```
# Monitor for SSOT-related messages
- MessageRouter initialization logs
- Deprecation warning appearances
- WebSocket message routing success
- User isolation enforcement logs
- No SSOT violation errors
```

**Expected Log Patterns:**
- ✅ `CanonicalMessageRouter initialized successfully`
- ✅ `Backwards compatibility layer active`
- ⚠️ `DeprecationWarning: Use CanonicalMessageRouter instead`
- ✅ `User-scoped factory pattern enforced`

### 6.5 Staging Test Execution Plan

#### Mission Critical Tests
```bash
# Test SSOT compliance
python tests/mission_critical/test_message_router_ssot_compliance.py

# Test WebSocket agent events
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py

# Test broadcast consolidation
python tests/unit/services/test_ssot_broadcast_consolidation_issue_982.py
```

#### Integration Tests Against Staging
```bash
# WebSocket connectivity to staging
python tests/e2e/staging/test_websocket_staging_connectivity.py

# Message routing end-to-end
python tests/integration/test_message_router_staging_integration.py

# User isolation validation
python tests/integration/test_user_isolation_staging.py
```

#### Golden Path Validation
- User login → Chat interface → Agent response flow
- Multi-user concurrent sessions
- Real-time WebSocket event delivery
- Message routing accuracy

### 6.6 Success Criteria

**Technical Validation:**
- [ ] Backend service deploys without errors
- [ ] Health endpoints return 200 OK
- [ ] WebSocket connections establish successfully
- [ ] Message routing operates correctly
- [ ] User isolation functions properly
- [ ] No SSOT compliance violations in logs

**Business Validation:**
- [ ] Chat functionality fully operational
- [ ] Agent events deliver in real-time
- [ ] Multi-user sessions work concurrently
- [ ] No cross-user event leakage
- [ ] Response times within acceptable limits

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Deployment ✅
**Risk Mitigation Factors:**
- **Interface Preservation:** All existing APIs maintained
- **Backwards Compatibility:** Legacy code continues working
- **Factory Pattern:** User isolation proven locally
- **Test Coverage:** 50+ MessageRouter-specific tests
- **Rollback Plan:** Legacy implementation preserved

### Monitoring Plan
**Real-time Monitoring:**
- WebSocket connection success rate (>99.5%)
- Message delivery latency (<100ms P95)
- Error rates for message routing (<0.1%)
- User isolation violations (0 incidents)
