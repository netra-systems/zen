- **Environment:** GCP staging deployment
- **Duration:** 30-60 minutes
- **Infrastructure:** Full staging stack

## 🧪 Detailed Test Implementation

### Phase 1: Unit Tests - VPC Connector Monitoring Logic

#### 1.1 VPC Connector State Management Tests
**File:** `tests/unit/infrastructure/test_vpc_connector_state_management.py`

**Key Tests:**
- `test_normal_to_capacity_pressure_transition()` - State transitions during pressure
- `test_capacity_pressure_timeout_adjustments()` - Dynamic timeout scaling
- `test_overloaded_state_emergency_bypass()` - Emergency bypass activation

**Expected Results:**
- **Initially:** FAIL (monitoring logic not implemented)
- **After Fixes:** PASS (monitoring and state management working)

#### 1.2 Database Timeout Configuration Tests
**File:** `tests/unit/infrastructure/test_database_timeout_config.py`

**Key Tests:**
- `test_vpc_capacity_pressure_timeout_scaling()` - Timeout scaling based on VPC metrics
- `test_600s_timeout_requirement_compliance()` - Issue #1278 600s timeout validation
- `test_connection_retry_backoff_under_vpc_pressure()` - VPC-aware retry logic

**Expected Results:**
- **Initially:** FAIL (capacity-aware scaling not implemented)
- **After Fixes:** PASS (dynamic timeouts working correctly)

### Phase 2: Integration Tests - Real Infrastructure Connectivity

#### 2.1 VPC Connector Capacity Stress Tests
**File:** `tests/integration/infrastructure/test_vpc_connector_capacity_stress.py`

**Critical Test:** `test_concurrent_cloud_sql_connections_via_vpc()`
```python
async def test_concurrent_cloud_sql_connections_via_vpc(self):
    """
    CRITICAL TEST - MUST FAIL INITIALLY

    Tests 15 concurrent Cloud SQL connections through VPC connector.
    Reproduces Issue #1278 capacity constraints.
    """
    concurrent_connections = 15  # Above current VPC capacity
    # Should timeout/fail initially due to capacity constraints
    # Should succeed after VPC connector scaling
```

**Expected Results:**
- **Initially:** FAIL (capacity exceeded, connections timeout)
- **After VPC Scaling:** PASS (handles concurrent load)

#### 2.2 Service Startup Sequence Tests
**File:** `tests/integration/infrastructure/test_startup_sequence_vpc_dependency.py`

**Critical Test:** `test_deterministic_startup_phase_3_database_connectivity()`
- Tests Phase 3 database connectivity during deterministic startup
- Should reproduce startup hanging due to VPC connectivity issues
- Validates startup sequence completes all 7 phases after fixes

**Expected Results:**
- **Initially:** FAIL (Phase 3 hangs, Phases 5-6 skipped, 503 errors)
- **After Fixes:** PASS (all phases complete successfully)

#### 2.3 SSL Certificate and Domain Configuration Tests
**File:** `tests/integration/infrastructure/test_ssl_domain_config_vpc_pressure.py`

**Key Domains Tested:**
- ✅ `staging.netrasystems.ai` (should work)
- ✅ `api-staging.netrasystems.ai` (should work)
- ❌ `*.staging.netrasystems.ai` (deprecated, should fail)

**Expected Results:**
- **Initially:** FAIL (SSL validation degrades under VPC pressure)
- **After Optimization:** PASS (SSL validation remains fast under load)

### Phase 3: E2E Staging GCP Tests - Complete Infrastructure Validation

#### 3.1 Golden Path E2E Tests with VPC Infrastructure
**File:** `tests/e2e/staging/test_golden_path_vpc_infrastructure.py`

**Mission Critical Test:** `test_complete_user_journey_vpc_resilience()`
```python
async def test_complete_user_journey_vpc_resilience(self):
    """
    MISSION CRITICAL - Complete user journey with VPC infrastructure.

    Tests: Login → WebSocket → Agent Execution → Database Persistence
    """
    # Test complete user flow through all infrastructure layers
    # Should fail at WebSocket/database connectivity initially
    # Must work end-to-end after comprehensive VPC infrastructure fixes
```

**Expected Results:**
- **Initially:** FAIL (503 errors, connection failures throughout journey)
- **After Infrastructure Fixes:** PASS (complete user journey works end-to-end)

#### 3.2 Infrastructure Resilience and Recovery Tests
**File:** `tests/e2e/staging/test_infrastructure_resilience_recovery.py`

**Key Tests:**
- `test_vpc_connector_auto_scaling_behavior()` - Auto-scaling under load
- `test_graceful_degradation_during_vpc_outage()` - Degraded mode functionality
- `test_infrastructure_monitoring_and_alerting()` - VPC capacity monitoring

## 🚀 Test Execution Strategy

### Execution Order & Commands

1. **Unit Tests First** (5-10 minutes)
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/unit/infrastructure/ -v --tb=short
   ```

2. **Integration Tests** (15-30 minutes)
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/integration/infrastructure/ -v -m "staging_gcp" --tb=short
