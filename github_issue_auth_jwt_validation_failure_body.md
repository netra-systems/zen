## Impact
**Business Impact:** Complete loss of user authentication affecting $500K+ ARR functionality. Users cannot access paid features, resulting in 80-90% functionality unavailable.

**Revenue Risk:** HIGH - Core business functions requiring authentication are completely broken.

## Current Behavior
- JWT validation failing with security alerts during auth service testing
- Token algorithm confusion preventing successful authentication
- `validateTokenAndGetUser` accessibility issues blocking user sessions
- Auth service responding but failing security validation checks

## Expected Behavior
- JWT tokens should validate successfully for authenticated users
- Security validation should pass for properly formatted tokens
- Users should be able to authenticate and access paid features
- Auth service should properly validate token algorithms

## Reproduction Steps
1. Deploy auth service to staging environment
2. Attempt user authentication via standard login flow
3. Observe JWT validation failures with security alerts
4. Check auth service logs for token algorithm errors

## Technical Details
- **Environment:** Staging GCP deployment
- **Error Pattern:** JWT security failures with possible algorithm confusion
- **Service Status:** Auth service responding but failing validation
- **Impact on Pipeline:** Agent pipeline tests failing due to authentication breakdown
- **Test Results:** 0% success rate for auth-dependent functionality

**Priority:** P1 Critical - Immediate attention required
