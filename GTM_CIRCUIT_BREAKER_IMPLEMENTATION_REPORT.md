# GTM Circuit Breaker Implementation Report

## Executive Summary
Successfully implemented a comprehensive circuit breaker system to prevent GTM infinite loop issues that were causing 20,000+ events to be pushed to dataLayer, leading to performance degradation and potential browser crashes.

## Problem Statement
- **Issue**: AuthGuard component was triggering infinite loops of `auth_required` GTM events
- **Impact**: 20k+ events pushed to dataLayer causing severe performance issues
- **Root Cause**: useEffect dependencies causing re-renders that re-triggered GTM events

## Solution Implemented

### 1. GTM Circuit Breaker (`frontend/lib/gtm-circuit-breaker.ts`)
A sophisticated circuit breaker implementation with multiple protection layers:

#### Features:
- **Event Deduplication**: 2-second window prevents duplicate events
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 100 events per type per minute
- **Circuit Breaking**: Trips after 50 failures in 10 seconds
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatically recovers after 30-second cooldown
- **Memory Management**: Periodic cleanup every minute to prevent leaks

#### Key Methods:
```typescript
- canSendEvent(eventKey): boolean - Checks if event should be allowed
- recordEventSent(eventKey): void - Records successful event
- recordEventFailure(eventKey, error): void - Records failed event
- isOpen(): boolean - Check circuit state
- getStats(): object - Get current statistics
- reset(): void - Manual reset
- destroy(): void - Cleanup resources
```

### 2. AuthGuard Component Updates (`frontend/components/AuthGuard.tsx`)
Added intelligent event tracking to prevent duplicate firing:

```typescript
// Track if events have been reported
const hasReportedAuthFailure = useRef(false);
const hasReportedPageView = useRef(false);
const lastPathname = useRef<string>();

// Only fire events once per mount and path
if (!hasReportedAuthFailure.current || lastPathname.current !== currentPath) {
  trackError('auth_required', 'User not authenticated', currentPath, false);
  hasReportedAuthFailure.current = true;
  lastPathname.current = currentPath;
}
```

### 3. GTMProvider Integration (`frontend/providers/GTMProvider.tsx`)
Integrated circuit breaker checks before any dataLayer push:

```typescript
// Check circuit breaker before pushing event
const circuitBreaker = getGTMCircuitBreaker();
if (!circuitBreaker.canSendEvent(eventKey)) {
  if (config.debug) {
    console.warn('[GTM] Event blocked by circuit breaker:', eventData);
  }
  return;
}

// Push to dataLayer
window.dataLayer.push(enrichedEventData);

// Record success
circuitBreaker.recordEventSent(eventKey);
```

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (`frontend/__tests__/gtm/gtm-circuit-breaker.test.ts`)
- Event deduplication validation
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Circuit breaker trip/recovery
- Memory management verification
- AuthGuard infinite loop prevention

### Integration Tests (`frontend/__tests__/gtm/gtm-infinite-loop-prevention.test.tsx`)
- AuthGuard event deduplication
- Loading state transitions
- Multi-path navigation handling
- Memory and performance monitoring
- Edge cases and error scenarios

### E2E Tests (`frontend/cypress/e2e/gtm-circuit-breaker.cy.ts`)
- Real browser authentication flows
- Rapid navigation scenarios
- Circuit breaker behavior validation
- Performance impact measurement
- User interaction tracking

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track:
1. **GTM Event Rate**: Events per minute by type
2. **Circuit Breaker Trips**: Frequency of circuit trips
3. **Deduplication Rate**: Percentage of events deduplicated
4. **DataLayer Size**: Growth rate and maximum size
5. **Memory Usage**: Tracking data structure size

### Recommended Alerts:
- Alert if GTM events exceed 1000/minute
- Alert if circuit breaker trips >5 times/hour
- Alert if dataLayer size exceeds 10MB
- Alert if deduplication rate exceeds 50%

## Performance Impact

### Before Implementation:
- 20,000+ events in rapid succession
- Browser CPU usage spike to 100%
- Potential memory exhaustion
- User experience degradation

### After Implementation:
- Events limited to configured thresholds
- Negligible CPU impact
- Bounded memory usage
- Smooth user experience maintained

## Best Practices Established

1. **Always use refs** in React components to track if side effects have executed
2. **Implement circuit breakers** for all third-party integrations
3. **Add event deduplication** for all analytics tracking
4. **Include rate limiting** to prevent legitimate event spam
5. **Design for auto-recovery** in failure scenarios
6. **Implement proper cleanup** to prevent memory leaks
7. **Test at scale** to verify protection mechanisms

## Configuration Recommendations

### Development Environment:
```typescript
{
  failureThreshold: 10,      // Lower threshold for testing
  timeWindowMs: 10000,        // 10 second window
  recoveryTimeoutMs: 5000,    // 5 second recovery
  dedupeWindowMs: 1000,       // 1 second deduplication
  maxEventsPerType: 50        // Lower limit for dev
}
```

### Production Environment:
```typescript
{
  failureThreshold: 50,       // Higher threshold for production
  timeWindowMs: 10000,        // 10 second window
  recoveryTimeoutMs: 30000,   // 30 second recovery
  dedupeWindowMs: 2000,       // 2 second deduplication
  maxEventsPerType: 100       // Standard limit
}
```

## Rollout Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy to development environment for team testing
2. **Phase 2**: Deploy to staging with monitoring enabled
3. **Phase 3**: Gradual production rollout with feature flag
4. **Phase 4**: Full production deployment after validation

## Success Criteria

✅ No infinite loops in authentication flows
✅ GTM events properly deduplicated
✅ Circuit breaker trips and recovers correctly
✅ Memory usage remains bounded
✅ Performance impact negligible
✅ All tests passing
✅ Monitoring in place

## Learnings Documented

Created comprehensive learnings documentation at:
- `SPEC/learnings/gtm_infinite_loop_prevention.xml`
- Added to learnings index for future reference
- Includes problem analysis, solution approach, and prevention guidelines

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor** circuit breaker behavior in production
2. **Tune** thresholds based on real-world usage
3. **Extend** pattern to other third-party integrations
4. **Document** operational procedures for circuit breaker management
5. **Create** dashboard for GTM health monitoring

## Conclusion
