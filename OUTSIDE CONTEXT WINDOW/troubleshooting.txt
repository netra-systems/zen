process
1: Start Gemini --yolo  in the v2/ folders

troubleshooting
1: Sometimes needs to be run multiple times
2: If persistent issue then instructions or spec needs editing
3: Sometimes the pre-existing plan.md needs to be deleted to "restart" the context
4: Other specs can cross-contaminte
5: Repetition issues add things like "limit x to 20 items"
6: Naming issues: use "netra" in naming conventions to help it know it should 
autocomplete on all training data not get sucked into specific training dataset
e.g. some specific similar thing in the data
7: check if plan generated actually matches intention of spec
8: frame things in positive - LLMs have trouble with negation
9: Add something like "{spec_name}:ENDS"  at the end of the spec. Generally good to "wrap" context when possible.

10: LLM s are good at "local" changes and struggle with "global" changes
11: Try to align to the LLMs preference / "standard/averages" whenever reasonable
this avoids having to "fight" the default without need
