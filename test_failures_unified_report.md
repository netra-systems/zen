## Active Test Failures

### 1. ClickHouse Test Configuration Error - FIXED ✅
**Test:** `netra_backend/tests/clickhouse/test_clickhouse_errors.py::TestClickHouseErrorHandling::test_invalid_query_handling`
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Error Type:** Configuration and Connection Issues
**Root Cause:** Test framework was disabling ClickHouse by default, and test configuration wasn't properly set for TEST environment
**Environment:** Test environment (localhost:8124)

**Issue Details:**
- Test framework base was setting `DEV_MODE_DISABLE_CLICKHOUSE=true` and `CLICKHOUSE_ENABLED=false`
- ClickHouse fixtures weren't overriding framework settings for `@pytest.mark.real_database` tests
- Configuration was using development port (8123) instead of test port (8124)
- Environment variable timing issues between collection and execution phases

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Modified `async_real_clickhouse_client` fixture in `netra_backend/tests/clickhouse/conftest.py`
2. Added forced configuration override for real_database tests
3. Set correct TEST environment credentials:
   - Host: localhost, Port: 8124
   - User: test, Password: test
   - Database: netra_test_analytics
4. Added configuration reload after environment variable changes

**Sub-Agent Assignment:** Process B Agent #2 (Completed)
