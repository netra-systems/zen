## Issue Title
```
[CLEANUP] Remove phantom issue #1208 reference from automation configs
```

## Issue Body
```markdown
## Impact
Phantom issue #1208 referenced in automation causing confusion and wasted developer time on non-existent work.

## Current Behavior
- Issue #1208 does not exist in GitHub repository
- Referenced in automation discussions and potentially other configs
- Causes false work queues and confusion about system state

## Expected Behavior
- All automation references point to existing, valid GitHub issues
- No phantom issue references in any configuration files
- Clean automation hygiene across the platform

## Root Cause Analysis
Investigation reveals this is likely:
- A typo for another issue number (possibly #1278 - database connectivity)
- A deleted/non-existent issue that was never cleaned up from automation
- An issue that was moved to another repository without cleanup

## Immediate Actions Required
1. **Audit all automation configs** for phantom issue references
2. **Remove any references to issue #1208** from automation files
3. **Verify all other issue numbers** in automation configs actually exist
4. **Document findings** to prevent future phantom references

## Technical Details
- **Files to check**: All automation config files, particularly:
  - `/scripts/config-issue-untangle.json` (if referenced)
  - Any other automation configuration files
  - Documentation that may reference #1208
- **Environment**: All environments
- **Priority**: Low complexity, high value cleanup

## Prevention Strategy
- Add validation script to verify all referenced issues exist
- Update process to require issue existence validation before adding to automation configs
- Regular audits of automation configuration hygiene

## Business Value
- **Eliminates developer confusion** about non-existent work items
- **Improves automation reliability** across the platform
- **Prevents wasted time** on phantom issues
- **Sets precedent** for better automation hygiene

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All references to issue #1208 removed from automation
- [ ] Validation that all other issue references in automation are valid
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect current state
- [ ] Process improvement to prevent future phantom references
