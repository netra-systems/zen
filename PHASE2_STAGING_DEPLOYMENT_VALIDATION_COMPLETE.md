## Technical Implementation Validation

### Phase 2 Architecture Confirmation
The validation confirmed the correct implementation of the Phase 2 delegation pattern:

```python
class ToolExecutionEngine(ToolExecutionEngineInterface):
    """Phase 2: Delegates to UserExecutionEngine instead of UnifiedToolExecutionEngine"""
    
    def __init__(self, websocket_manager=None):
        self._websocket_manager = websocket_manager
        self._user_execution_engine = None  # Deferred creation with user context
        self._migrated = True
        self._migration_issue = "#1146"
        self._ssot_target = "UserExecutionEngine"
```

### User Isolation Security Validation
