# ENHANCEMENT: WebSocket Factory Pattern Simplification

## Architectural Improvement - P1 HIGH

**Parent Issue**: #1184 - WebSocket Manager await error
**Business Impact**: Long-term system stability and developer productivity
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

## Problem Summary

Current WebSocket factory implementation has dual sync/async patterns causing developer confusion and production errors. Multiple factory functions and backward compatibility layers create unnecessary complexity.

**Current Complex Patterns**:
- `get_websocket_manager()` - Synchronous
- `get_websocket_manager_async()` - Asynchronous
- Legacy compatibility layers
- 36+ import patterns consolidated but still complex

## Strategic Goals

### 1. Single Factory Pattern
Standardize on one clear, obvious way to get WebSocket manager instances:

```python
# PROPOSED: Single async factory (recommended)
manager = await WebSocketManagerFactory.create_manager(user_context=ctx)

# OR: Single sync factory (alternative)
manager = WebSocketManagerFactory.get_manager(user_context=ctx)
```

### 2. Legacy Pattern Removal
- [ ] Remove backward compatibility layers causing confusion
- [ ] Eliminate deprecated import patterns
- [ ] Clean up factory function duplication
- [ ] Simplify canonical import patterns

### 3. Developer Experience
- [ ] Clear, single pattern for all use cases
- [ ] Obvious async vs sync choice based on context
- [ ] Self-documenting factory interface
- [ ] IDE auto-completion friendly

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Design
- [ ] Audit all current WebSocket manager usage patterns
- [ ] Identify sync vs async requirements for each use case
- [ ] Design unified factory interface
- [ ] Create migration plan for existing code

### Phase 2: Factory Implementation
- [ ] Implement new unified factory class
- [ ] Maintain user isolation and SSOT compliance
- [ ] Add comprehensive type hints and documentation
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility during transition

### Phase 3: Codebase Migration
- [ ] Update all production code to use new factory
- [ ] Migrate test code to new patterns
- [ ] Remove legacy factory functions
- [ ] Update import statements throughout codebase

### Phase 4: Validation and Cleanup
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Validate in staging environment
- [ ] Monitor production deployment
- [ ] Remove deprecated code and documentation

## Technical Requirements

### SSOT Compliance
- [ ] Single source of truth for WebSocket manager creation
- [ ] Consistent with existing SSOT architectural patterns
- [ ] No duplicate factory implementations
- [ ] Clear canonical import pattern

### User Isolation
- [ ] Maintain factory-based user context isolation
- [ ] Ensure no shared state between users
- [ ] Preserve security boundaries
- [ ] Support concurrent user sessions

### Performance
- [ ] No performance degradation from simplification
- [ ] Efficient manager instance creation
- [ ] Appropriate caching where beneficial
- [ ] Memory usage optimization

## Acceptance Criteria

### Code Quality
- [ ] Single, clear factory pattern for WebSocket manager creation
- [ ] All legacy factory functions removed
- [ ] Comprehensive type hints and documentation
- [ ] 100% test coverage for new factory

### Production Stability
- [ ] Zero regressions in WebSocket functionality
- [ ] Staging environment validates new patterns
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] No impact on Golden Path user flow

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Clear developer documentation
- [ ] Migration guide for future developers
- [ ] IDE support for auto-completion
- [ ] Obvious usage patterns

## Risk Assessment

**Medium Risk**: Architectural change affecting core infrastructure
**High Reward**: Eliminates class of async/await pattern errors

### Mitigation Strategies
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage before changes
- [ ] Gradual migration with validation checkpoints
- [ ] Backward compatibility during transition period
- [ ] Clear rollback plan for each phase
