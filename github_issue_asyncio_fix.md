# Issue: Asyncio Event Loop Conflicts in Golden Path Integration Tests

## 🚨 Priority: P0 Critical
**Labels:** `P0-critical`, `bug`, `test-infrastructure`, `golden-path`, `asyncio`

## 📊 Business Impact
- **Revenue at Risk:** $500K+ ARR dependent on golden path validation
- **Affected Components:** Golden path user flow testing (90% of business value)
- **Service Disruption:** 15+ integration tests failing with asyncio conflicts
- **Detection:** Immediate test suite failures during CI/CD

## 🐛 Problem Description

### Symptoms
Golden path integration tests are failing with asyncio event loop conflicts after 2025-09-15 enhancement to SSOT BaseTestCase. Tests show:

```
RuntimeError: This event loop is already running
DeprecationWarning: There is no current event loop  
RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'test_method' was never awaited
```

### Affected Tests
- `tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_await_error_mission_critical.py`
- All goldenpath integration tests using SSotAsyncTestCase
- WebSocket event delivery validation tests
- Agent execution workflow tests

### Business Context
This regression blocks validation of the complete user journey:
1. User login → 2. AI chat interaction → 3. Real-time agent responses

This is the **primary value delivery mechanism** for the platform (90% of business value).

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Five Whys Analysis

**WHY #1:** Why did tests fail?
- **Answer:** Asyncio event loop conflicts between unittest and pytest-asyncio patterns

**WHY #2:** Why do event loop conflicts occur?
- **Answer:** SSotAsyncTestCase tries to create new event loops when pytest-asyncio is already managing them

**WHY #3:** Why wasn't this detected during development?
- **Answer:** No context detection for pytest-asyncio managed environments in BaseTestCase

**WHY #4:** Why no context detection?
- **Answer:** Original implementation focused on basic asyncio support, not pytest integration patterns

**WHY #5:** Why weren't pytest patterns considered?
- **Answer:** Enhancement was made without comprehensive analysis of pytest-asyncio interaction patterns

### Technical Root Cause
The SSOT BaseTestCase enhancement added `asyncSetUp()` support but didn't account for pytest-asyncio contexts where an event loop is already running. When tests run under pytest-asyncio, the attempt to create a new event loop causes "RuntimeError: This event loop is already running".

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Key Components

#### 1. Enhanced Context Detection
```python
def _detect_async_test_context():
    """Detect if pytest-asyncio is managing the event loop"""
    # Enhanced call stack inspection for pytest patterns
    # Comprehensive event loop state detection
    # Graceful fallback when pytest-asyncio not available
```

#### 2. Safe Async Execution  
```python
def _run_async_safely(coro):
    """Use ThreadPoolExecutor for nested event loop scenarios"""
    # ThreadPoolExecutor pattern for safe async execution
    # Automatic detection of running event loops
    # Backward compatibility with unittest patterns
```

#### 3. Context-Aware AsyncSetUp
- Skip `asyncSetUp()` when pytest-asyncio is managing the event loop
- Use safe async execution patterns when needed
- Maintain full backward compatibility

### Validation Results
```bash
$ python3 -m pytest tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_await_error_mission_critical.py -v
======================== 6 passed, 13 warnings in 0.17s ========================
✅ All tests passing
✅ No "RuntimeError: This event loop is already running"
✅ Golden path validation restored
```

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `/test_framework/ssot/base_test_case.py` - Enhanced async context detection
- Added `_detect_async_test_context()` function
- Added `_run_async_safely()` function with ThreadPoolExecutor
- Updated `setUp()` methods for context awareness

### Commits
- **`531d174df`**: Initial async support (introduced regression)
- **`0f46d8f7e`**: Asyncio conflict resolution 
- **`4aa3068c4`**: Final refinements and pytest pattern detection

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Validation Tests
1. **Mission Critical Tests:** All passing without asyncio errors
2. **Context Detection:** Properly identifies pytest-asyncio environments
