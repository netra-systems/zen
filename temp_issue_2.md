# P1 Import Issue: Missing 'UserWebSocketEmitter' import from websocket_bridge_factory

## Problem Description
Tests are failing due to missing `UserWebSocketEmitter` class import from `netra_backend.app.services.websocket_bridge_factory`. The class was removed during SSOT consolidation (Issue #679) but tests still reference it.

## Affected Files
- `netra_backend/tests/unit/test_websocket_bridge.py:18`
- `netra_backend/tests/unit/tool_dispatcher/test_tool_dispatcher_user_isolation.py:44`

## Error Details
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'UserWebSocketEmitter' from 'netra_backend.app.services.websocket_bridge_factory'
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The `UserWebSocketEmitter` class was removed from `websocket_bridge_factory.py` during SSOT consolidation to eliminate WebSocket emitter proliferation (Issue #679). The SSOT implementation is now `UnifiedWebSocketEmitter`. However, unit tests still attempt to import the old class directly.

## Current State
- `UserWebSocketEmitter` class removed for SSOT compliance
- `UnifiedWebSocketEmitter` is the SSOT implementation
- Tests need to be updated to use SSOT implementation

## Related Issues
- Closed: Issue #679 - SSOT-incomplete-migration-websocket-emitter-proliferation
- This is test infrastructure cleanup needed after the SSOT consolidation

## Business Impact
- WebSocket bridge and tool dispatcher isolation tests cannot execute
- Test coverage gaps in WebSocket functionality
- Potential deployment blocking if these tests are required

## Recommended Solution
1. Update tests to import and use `UnifiedWebSocketEmitter` instead
2. OR add compatibility alias for `UserWebSocketEmitter` â†’ `UnifiedWebSocketEmitter`
3. Verify all WebSocket test patterns use SSOT implementation

## Investigation Priority
P1 - Critical test infrastructure blocking test execution
