**Status:** Infrastructure audit complete - VPC configuration appears correct, investigating application-level connectivity

## üîç Infrastructure Audit Findings

**VPC Connector:** ‚úÖ CONFIGURED
- Name: `staging-connector` properly attached to `netra-backend-staging`
- VPC Access: `all-traffic` egress configured correctly
- Annotations: `run.googleapis.com/vpc-access-connector: staging-connector`

**Redis Instance:** ‚úÖ ACTIVE
- Instance: `staging-redis-f1adc35c` at `10.166.204.83:6379`
- Status: READY (confirmed via gcloud)
- Network: Private VPC as expected

**Recent PRs:** ‚úÖ ADDRESSED
- PR #705: "Fix: Issue #598 - Redis configuration for health endpoints" (Sep 13)
- PR #199: "Redis SSOT consolidation - resolves WebSocket 1011 errors" (Sep 10)
- Multiple Redis configuration fixes deployed recently

## ü§î Five Whys Analysis

1. **Why is Redis connection failing?** ‚Üí VPC routing appears correct, likely application-level connection issue
2. **Why isn't VPC routing working?** ‚Üí Infrastructure is configured correctly, need to test actual connectivity vs configuration
3. **Why wasn't this caught earlier?** ‚Üí Missing pre-deployment Redis connectivity validation in health checks
4. **Why is staging health degraded?** ‚Üí Redis connection failure affects overall health endpoint status
5. **Why is this critical?** ‚Üí Blocks $500K+ ARR Golden Path validation and chat functionality

## üéØ Next Actions

**Immediate (Priority 1):**
- Test actual Redis connectivity from Cloud Run: `redis-cli -h 10.166.204.83 -p 6379 ping`
- Check Cloud Run logs for specific Redis connection errors beyond Error -3
- Verify Redis authentication configuration matches application expectations

**Investigation (Priority 2):**
- Compare current Redis configuration vs working state from recent PR fixes
- Test if this is intermittent connectivity vs persistent configuration issue
- Validate if recent SSOT consolidation affected Redis connection patterns

**Root Cause Determination:**
This appears to be either:
- A) Application-level Redis connection configuration issue
- B) Intermittent network connectivity issue requiring retry logic
- C) Already resolved and needs verification

**Business Impact:** Staging validation blocked - preventing deployment confidence for $500K+ ARR chat functionality

**Next:** Testing actual connectivity to determine if infrastructure vs application issue
