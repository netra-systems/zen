# WebSocket Staging Fixes Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. WebSocket Fallback in Staging/Production
**Problem:** WebSocket endpoint was creating fallback agent handlers in staging when dependencies were missing, instead of failing properly.

**Fix:** Modified `netra_backend/app/routes/websocket.py` to:
- Check environment before deciding on fallback vs failure
- Raise `RuntimeError` in staging/production when dependencies are missing
- Only allow fallback in development or when `TESTING=1` flag is set

### 2. Agent Supervisor Initialization
**Problem:** Potential race conditions and silent failures in agent supervisor initialization.

**Fix:** Enhanced `netra_backend/app/startup_module.py` to:
- Add comprehensive logging for supervisor creation
- Verify WebSocket enhancement status
- Attempt re-enhancement if needed
- Fail hard in staging/production environments
- Add verification checks for app.state attributes

### 3. WebSocket Dependency Logging
**Problem:** Insufficient visibility into dependency status when WebSocket connections are established.

**Fix:** Added detailed logging in WebSocket endpoint to:
- Log environment and testing flag status
- Log supervisor and thread_service availability
- Check if startup is complete before allowing connections
- Provide clear error messages with missing dependencies

## Startup Sequence Verification

The startup sequence is correctly ordered:
1. **Database** (CRITICAL priority)
2. **Redis** (HIGH priority, depends on database)
3. **Auth Service** (HIGH priority, depends on database)
4. **WebSocket** (HIGH priority, depends on database, redis)
5. **Agent Supervisor** (HIGH priority, depends on database, websocket, auth_service)

This ensures that:
- WebSocket infrastructure is ready before supervisor creation
- Supervisor has all required dependencies when initialized
- WebSocket enhancement happens during supervisor initialization

## Key Components Verified

### AgentRegistry (`agent_registry.py`)
✅ Calls `enhance_tool_dispatcher_with_notifications` in `set_websocket_manager()`
✅ Verifies enhancement with `_websocket_enhanced` flag
✅ Raises `RuntimeError` if enhancement fails

### SupervisorAgent (`supervisor_consolidated.py`)
✅ Receives WebSocket manager during initialization
✅ Calls `registry.set_websocket_manager()` during setup
✅ Registers default agents after WebSocket setup

### Startup Manager (`startup_manager.py`)
✅ Agent supervisor registered with correct dependencies
✅ Proper initialization order maintained
✅ Component status tracking for health checks

## Environment-Specific Behavior

### Staging/Production
- **NO FALLBACK** - Missing dependencies cause hard failures
- Clear error messages indicating missing components
- Startup must complete before WebSocket accepts connections

### Development
- Fallback handlers allowed for easier development
- Graceful degradation when dependencies missing
- Warning logs instead of errors

### Testing (TESTING=1)
- Fallback allowed even in staging for E2E tests
- Special handling for test scenarios
- Mock handlers can be used

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Alert on these log patterns in staging/production:**
   - "Critical WebSocket dependencies missing"
   - "Failed to create agent supervisor"
   - "Tool dispatcher enhancement failed"

2. **Health checks should verify:**
   - `app.state.agent_supervisor` is not None
   - `app.state.thread_service` is not None
   - Tool dispatcher has `_websocket_enhanced=True`

3. **Startup validation:**
   - Check `app.state.startup_complete=True` before accepting connections
   - Monitor startup duration for anomalies
   - Track component initialization failures

## Testing Requirements

All changes are covered by:
- Unit tests for fallback prevention
- Integration tests for supervisor initialization
- Mission-critical tests for WebSocket events

Run these tests before deployment:
```bash
# Unit tests for WebSocket behavior
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/unit/test_websocket_no_fallback_staging.py

# Mission-critical WebSocket tests
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py

# Integration tests for startup
python -m pytest netra_backend/tests/integration/test_startup_manager.py
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes to staging
2. Monitor logs for successful supervisor initialization
3. Verify no fallback handlers are created
4. Check that all WebSocket events are properly sent
5. Validate chat functionality works end-to-end
