    <prompt>How can you use multi-query attention to speed up an LLM</prompt>
    <response>Multi query attention speeds up inference by reducing the size of the key value cache which is a major memory consumer During text generation the model has to read and write to this cache for every new token By having all attention heads share the same key and value vectors the size of the cache is significantly reduced leading to faster memory access and lower latency</response>

    <prompt>Create a plan for benchmarking the performance of a quantized model against its original version</prompt>
    <response>The plan would have three parts First benchmark latency by measuring the average time per inference on a single input Second benchmark throughput by measuring the maximum number of inferences per second under heavy load with batching Third evaluate accuracy by running both models on a standard evaluation dataset and comparing their scores to quantify any quality degradation</response>

    <prompt>Explain how you would apply structured pruning to a Transformer model</prompt>
    <response>I would use a library that supports structured pruning to identify and remove the least important attention heads or entire feed forward network blocks The process involves calculating an importance score for each block and then removing the ones with the lowest scores After pruning the model would need to be fine tuned for a few epochs to recover any lost accuracy</response>

    <prompt>The first token latency of my generative model is very high How can this be improved</prompt>
    <response>High first token latency is often due to the processing of the initial prompt You can improve this by using a model compiler like TensorRT to optimize the model for the specific hardware Another approach is to use a KV cache a key value cache to store the state of the prompt so it does not need to be recomputed for every request</response>

    <prompt>Describe a scenario where knowledge distillation is a better choice than quantization</prompt>
    <response>Knowledge distillation is a better choice when you need to deploy a model on a device with very strict hardware constraints where even a quantized version of a large model is too big In this case you can distill the knowledge into a much smaller student model with a completely different and more efficient architecture that is designed specifically for the target hardware</response>

    <prompt>How would you optimize an LLM for a task that requires a very long context window</prompt>
    <response>To handle a very long context I would use a model that supports techniques like Grouped Query Attention GQA which reduces the memory footprint of the KV cache Additionally I would use an inference server that implements PagedAttention to manage the large KV cache more efficiently without running into memory fragmentation issues</response>

  <prompt_response>
    <prompt>The GPU memory usage of my model is too high even with batching what could be the cause</prompt>
    <response>A likely cause is the KV cache which stores attention keys and values for past tokens in a sequence and can grow very large especially with long contexts or large batches To solve this you could use techniques like Multi Query Attention to reduce the cache size or use an inference server with PagedAttention for more efficient memory management</response>

    <prompt>Explain how to use speculative decoding with a small and large LLM</prompt>
    <response>First you generate a short sequence of say five tokens using the small fast draft model Then you feed this sequence along with the prompt into the large accurate model in a single forward pass The large model's output will validate how many of the drafted tokens were correct You accept the correct ones and then repeat the process This can be much faster than generating one token at a time with the large model</response>

    <prompt>Describe an A B testing framework to compare a new optimized model against the current production model</prompt>
    <response>I would set up a router that directs a small fraction of user traffic say 5 percent to the new optimized model The remaining 95 percent would go to the existing production model I would then collect key business metrics for both groups such as user engagement conversion rates or issue resolution rates as well as technical metrics like latency and error rates After a set period I would compare these metrics to decide if the new model is better</response>

    <prompt>How can model optimization contribute to green AI and sustainability</prompt>
    <response>Model optimization directly contributes to green AI by reducing the computational resources needed to train and run AI models Techniques like quantization and pruning lead to smaller models that consume less electricity during inference which lowers the carbon footprint of data centers Similarly efficient training methods like PEFT reduce the massive energy costs associated with training large models</response>
