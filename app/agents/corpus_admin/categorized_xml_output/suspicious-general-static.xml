    <prompt>Can Netra optimize the performance of vector databases used in RAG systems?</prompt>
    <response>Yes! Netra uses agents and tools to optimize the performance of data used for different purposes including RAG and data analyses, but not limited to those. The platform's focus is on the AI inference stack, including the LLM calls, agentic steps, and tool usage within applications like RAG systems. While it provides visibility into the overall performance of a RAG query, its optimization features are centered on the language model interactions rather than the database retrieval component. </response>
