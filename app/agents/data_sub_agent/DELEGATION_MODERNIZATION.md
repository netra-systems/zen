## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Delegation Context Creation
```python
def _create_delegation_context(self, operation: str, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> ExecutionContext:
    - Creates standardized execution contexts
    - Proper metadata handling
    - Unique run ID generation
```

### 2. Reliability Execution
```python
async def _execute_with_reliability(self, context: ExecutionContext, operation_func) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    - Integrated reliability manager execution
    - Performance monitoring
    - Error handling and recovery
```

### 3. Analysis Operations Integration
```python
async def _execute_analysis_operation(self, context: ExecutionContext, operation_name: str, *args) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    - Standardized analysis operation execution
    - Dynamic method resolution
    - Reliability pattern integration
```

## Backward Compatibility

Maintained full backward compatibility with:
- `AgentDelegation = ModernAgentDelegation` alias
- All existing method signatures preserved
- Same return types and behavior

## Dependencies

### Required Components
- `app.agents.base.interface.BaseExecutionInterface`
