"""
Staging Environment Integration Tests

This module contains integration tests specifically designed for staging environment
validation. These tests ensure proper configuration, service startup sequences,
and system behavior in the staging deployment environment.

Test Categories:
- Configuration validation and environment variable management
- Secrets management integration with Google Secret Manager
- Multi-service startup sequences and dependency resolution
- Health checks and service orchestration
- Staging-specific behaviors that differ from development

All tests follow testing.xml requirements with proper mock justification
and focus on real functionality validation.
