"""Services Tests - Split from test_staging_multi_service_startup_sequence.py

Business Value Justification (BVJ):
- Segment: Platform/Internal
- Business Goal: Platform Stability and Deployment Reliability
- Value Impact: Ensures proper service orchestration and dependency resolution in staging
- Revenue Impact: Prevents failed deployments that could delay releases and impact $2M+ ARR

Tests correct startup order (Auth → Backend → Frontend), health check cascade,
and service dependency resolution in staging environment.
