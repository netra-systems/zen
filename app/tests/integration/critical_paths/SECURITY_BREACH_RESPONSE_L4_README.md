# Security Breach Detection and Response L4 Test Suite

## Overview

The `test_security_breach_response_l4.py` implements a comprehensive L4 (Level 4) security testing suite that validates the Netra platform's ability to detect, respond to, and recover from various security threats in a staging environment.

## Business Value Justification (BVJ)

- **Segment**: Platform/Internal
- **Business Goal**: Security Incident Prevention and Response
- **Value Impact**: Prevents data breaches and unauthorized access
- **Strategic Impact**: $35K MRR protection from security incidents

## Test Architecture

### Core Components

1. **SecurityBreachResponseL4Test**: Main test class extending L4StagingCriticalPathTestBase
2. **SecurityBreachMetrics**: Comprehensive metrics tracking for security events
3. **AttackVector**: Structured attack simulation configuration
4. **Multi-stage Attack Simulation**: Advanced persistent threat simulation

### Key Features

- **Real Staging Environment Testing**: Tests against actual staging services

## Attack Vectors Tested

### 1. Brute Force Attacks
- **Target**: Authentication endpoints
- **Validation**: Rate limiting, account lockout
- **Expected Response**: Blocked after N attempts

### 2. SQL Injection Attacks
- **Target**: Login and API endpoints
- **Validation**: Pattern detection, request blocking
- **Expected Response**: Malicious queries blocked

### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Target**: User input endpoints
- **Validation**: Content sanitization
- **Expected Response**: Script tags removed/escaped

### 4. DDoS Simulation
- **Target**: All public endpoints
- **Validation**: Rate limiting effectiveness
- **Expected Response**: Service remains available

### 5. Session Hijacking
- **Target**: Session management
- **Validation**: Session validation, access control
- **Expected Response**: Invalid sessions rejected

### 6. API Abuse

- **Expected Response**: Unauthorized access denied

### 7. WebSocket Flooding
- **Target**: WebSocket connections
- **Validation**: Message rate limiting
- **Expected Response**: Connection throttled

## Multi-Stage Attack Simulation

The test implements a sophisticated attack chain:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Endpoint discovery and vulnerability scanning
2. **Initial Compromise**: Credential stuffing and authentication bypass
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Admin endpoint access attempts
4. **Data Exfiltration**: Sensitive data access attempts

**Success Criteria**: All stages should be detected and blocked by security measures.

## Security Considerations

### Ethical Testing
- All attacks are simulated in controlled staging environment
- No real user data is compromised
- Tests use synthetic/test credentials only
- Attack patterns are designed to trigger security responses, not bypass them

### Test Isolation
- Each test creates isolated attack scenarios
- Test data is cleaned up after execution
- No persistent security state changes
- All logging uses test-specific identifiers

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Event Logging
- All attack attempts are logged with detailed metadata
- Detection results are tracked for analysis
- Response times are measured and recorded
- Incident escalation paths are validated

### Performance Monitoring
- System resource usage during attacks
- Service availability and response times
- Rate limiter effectiveness
- Circuit breaker behavior

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Staging Environment Unavailable**: Verify service connectivity
2. **High False Positives**: Review detection sensitivity settings
3. **Slow Response Times**: Check staging resource allocation
4. **Test Timeouts**: Adjust timeout configurations for staging

### Debug Information
- Security events are logged to Redis with test identifiers
- Attack payloads and responses are captured
- Detailed metrics are available in test results
- Service call counts help identify bottlenecks

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection testing
