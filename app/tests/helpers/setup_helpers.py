    Performance Optimization Report:
    
    Current State: The system processes 500 requests per second with 200ms p95 latency.
    GPU utilization sits at 65% with 12GB memory usage.
    
    Proposed Changes:
    1. Enable batch processing with batch_size=32 (currently 8)
    2. Implement KV cache with 2GB allocation
    3. Use INT8 quantization for 50% memory reduction
    
    Implementation:
    ```bash
    pip install optimization-toolkit
    python optimize.py --batch-size 32 --quantize int8
    ```
    
    Expected Results:
    - Throughput: 500 RPS → 1500 RPS (200% increase)
    - Latency: 200ms → 120ms (40% reduction)
    - Memory: 12GB → 6GB (50% reduction)
    - Cost: $1000/month → $600/month
    
    Trade-offs: 0.5% accuracy loss acceptable for 3x performance gain.
