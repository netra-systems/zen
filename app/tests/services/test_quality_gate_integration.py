        System Optimization Plan
        
        Current Performance Baseline:
        - Request latency: 450ms p95, 200ms p50
        - Throughput: 1,200 requests per second
        - GPU utilization: 45% average, 78% peak
        - Memory usage: 14GB / 16GB available
        - Monthly cost: $3,500 for compute resources
        
        Identified Bottlenecks:
        1. Inefficient batch processing (batch_size=4)
        2. No caching for repeated queries
        3. Synchronous I/O operations blocking GPU
        
        Optimization Strategy:
        We will optimize the system to improve performance and reduce costs.
        
        Phase 1 - Quick Wins (Week 1):
        - Increase batch_size to 32
        - Enable KV cache with 2GB allocation
        - Implement async I/O handlers
        
        Implementation Steps:
        ```bash
        # Update configuration
        sed -i 's/batch_size=4/batch_size=32/' config.yaml
        
        # Install caching layer
        pip install redis-cache==2.1.0
        python setup_cache.py --size 2GB --ttl 3600
        
        # Deploy async handlers
        git checkout feature/async-io
        python deploy.py --service inference --async
        ```
        
        Phase 2 - Advanced Optimizations (Week 2):
        - Implement INT8 quantization
        - Enable tensor parallelism across 4 GPUs
        - Use Flash Attention 2 for transformer layers
        
        Expected Outcomes:
        - Latency: 450ms → 180ms p95 (60% reduction)
        - Throughput: 1,200 → 3,600 RPS (3x increase)
        - GPU utilization: 45% → 85% (better resource usage)
        - Memory: 14GB → 8GB (43% reduction)
        - Cost: $3,500 → $2,100/month (40% savings)
        
        Configuration Changes Required:
        - Change the batch processing settings from synchronous to asynchronous
        - Reduce memory footprint by implementing efficient caching
        
        Success Metrics:
        - All API endpoints respond < 200ms p95
        - Zero downtime during migration
        - Accuracy degradation < 0.5%
        
        Rollback Plan:
        - Keep previous deployment in blue-green setup
        - Monitor error rates, rollback if > 1%
        - Maintain config backups in git
        
        Trade-offs:
        - 0.3% accuracy loss from quantization
        - Increased complexity in deployment
        - Initial 2-day migration effort required

        Database Migration Action Plan
        
        Prerequisites:
        - Backup current database: pg_dump production_db > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
        - Test migration on staging environment
        - Schedule maintenance window (2-hour duration)
        
        Step-by-Step Instructions:
        1. Enable read-only mode: UPDATE system_config SET read_only = true;
        2. Stop application services: systemctl stop netra-api netra-worker
        3. Run migration script: python migrate_schema.py --from v2.1 --to v2.2
        4. Verify data integrity: python verify_migration.py --check-counts --validate-indexes
        5. Update application configuration: sed -i 's/v2.1/v2.2/' config/database.yaml
        6. Restart services: systemctl start netra-api netra-worker
        7. Disable read-only mode: UPDATE system_config SET read_only = false;
        8. Monitor for 30 minutes: tail -f /var/log/netra/*.log
        
        Success Criteria:
        - All tables migrated successfully (zero data loss)
        - Application starts without errors
        - API response time < 200ms p95
        - No error spikes in monitoring dashboard
        
        Rollback Procedure:
        - If errors detected: immediately restore from backup
        - Command: psql production_db < backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
        - Estimated rollback time: 15 minutes
        
        Risk Mitigation:
        - Database backup completed and verified
        - Staging environment tested successfully
        - Rollback plan ready and tested

        Error Analysis: Database Connection Timeout
        
        Error Details:
        - Error Code: CONN_TIMEOUT_5432
        - Timestamp: 2024-08-14T10:30:45.123Z
        - Affected Service: netra-api-v2.1.3
        - Connection Pool: postgresql://prod-db-primary:5432/netra_db
        
        Root Cause Analysis:
        The error occurs when database connection pool exhausted (max_connections=100).
        Current active connections: 98/100, with 45 idle connections held by background tasks.
        High query volume during peak hours (10:30-11:00 AM) exceeded capacity.
        
        Immediate Actions Taken:
        1. Increased connection pool size: max_connections=150
        2. Reduced connection timeout: connection_timeout=30s
        3. Enabled connection pooling: pgbouncer with pool_size=50
        4. Killed long-running queries: SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state_change < now() - interval '5 minutes';
        
        Prevention Measures:
        - Monitor connection usage with alerts at 80% threshold
        - Implement connection pool scaling during peak hours
        - Optimize slow queries identified in pg_stat_statements
        - Schedule background tasks during off-peak hours (2-4 AM)
