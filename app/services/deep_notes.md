Agent process

Concept
Deep agent for system wide analysis
Can also create artifacts for Middleware and “fast” analysis, e.g. for static code

Triage
Parsing of user goals
Plan
What tools to use / next step in process
Directing and focusing “Curating” path
Tools
General agent tools
Memory/scratch pad
Classic tools
Product: Core Apex Agent Recommendation Engine See “Core engine”
Normalization
Raw Log access related
Enriched log access
Understands logs
Understanding specific types of workloads
For example, understanding agents steps
History review, what as been previously tried
Artifacts
Classical process upgraded artifacts, e.g. vector similarity of log performance items
Demand options
Matching supply and demand options
Supply options
Classical process accessing supply items
Understands optimization context
The 3 levels of Service/Model/Params
Optimization options
Recommendations of how to build/edit supply specifics
E.g. like those lists of recommendations like KV prefix
Pilot V1 strategy recomendation engine
Specificity of tools and discovery, e.g. not just “KV prefix” but “that timestamp at start of file is messing up your KV prefix”
Validation of existing options
Suggesting unknown unknowns
Context understanding
Tools to understanding context of users code
Tuning options
Tuning specific outputs, e.g. setting specific config variables etc. for specific 
Mix of classic and other tools
Product: Core Apex Agent Recommendation Engine
Validating work
Via review by other sub agents or processes
Web search to check some items, e.g. “existing database shows 2.5 as optimal, but I see 3.5 came out today”..
Running classical validations and simulations
Cost and financial simulations
Policy work
Items related to human policy and governance
Explaining work
Actions
TBD. part of activation concepts
Draft config/code edits for human review
Request human approval
Send email
Trigger alert
Involve other humans
