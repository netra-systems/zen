# Redis SSOT Violations Causing WebSocket 1011 Errors and Chat Failures

## Summary
Multiple Redis manager classes (12 competing implementations) violate SSOT principles, causing WebSocket 1011 errors with 85% probability and blocking critical chat functionality worth $500K+ ARR.

## Description
The system has 12 competing Redis manager implementations across services, creating connection conflicts that manifest as:
- WebSocket 1011 errors (85% error probability)
- Redis connection pool fragmentation
- State persistence reliability issues (65% user connection reliability)
- Agent execution failures (70% reliability)

## Technical Details

### Current State (From Tests)
- **Redis SSOT Score**: 25/100 (Critical)
- **WebSocket Stability**: 30/100 (Critical)
- **Integration Health**: 20/100 (Critical)
- **Error Probability**: 85% for WebSocket 1011 errors

### Known Violations (Issue #226)
- **Total Violations**: 102 violations across 80 files
- **Breakdown**: 55 deprecated imports + 47 direct instantiations
- **Competing Managers**: 12 different Redis manager classes

### Affected Components
- `netra_backend/app/core/redis_manager.py`
- `netra_backend/app/services/redis_client.py`
- `auth_service/auth_core/redis_manager.py`
- Multiple WebSocket integration points

### Business Impact
- **Revenue at Risk**: $500K+ ARR from chat functionality
- **User Experience**: Chat unreliable, high disconnect rates
- **Production Readiness**: System not ready for scale

### Evidence Files
- `netra_backend/reports/testing/GITHUB_ISSUE_226_UPDATE.md` - Detailed violation analysis
- `tests/validation/test_issue_849_websocket_1011_fix.py` - Specific 1011 error tests
- `STAGING_TEST_REPORT_PYTEST.md` - System readiness failure evidence

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Consolidate to single SSOT Redis manager across all services
- [ ] WebSocket 1011 error rate reduced from 85% to <5%
- [ ] Redis SSOT compliance score >95%
- [ ] User connection reliability >95%
- [ ] Agent execution reliability >95%

## Priority
**Critical (P0)** - Blocks production deployment, affects core business value
