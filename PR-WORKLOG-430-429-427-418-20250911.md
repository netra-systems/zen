## Process Log

### PR #430 - WebSocket REST API endpoints
**Step 1 - READ PR**: ✅ COMPLETED
- Source: `feature/issue-413-websocket-rest-api-1757619972` → Target: `develop-long-lived` ✅
- Status: MERGEABLE (no conflicts) but UNSTABLE (CI failures)
- **BLOCKING ISSUES**: Multiple CI failures (Architecture Compliance, SSOT, Integration Tests)
- **ACTION**: Cannot merge - needs CI fixes and code review
- **DECISION**: SKIP merge until CI passes

### PR #429 - Tool Execution Event Confirmation  
**Step 1 - READ PR**: ✅ COMPLETED
- Source: `feature/issue-377-1757619903` → Target: `develop-long-lived` ✅  
- Status: CONFLICTING (21 commits ahead causing drift)
- **CONFLICTS**: Documentation files, SSOT registry, database manager changes
- **ASSESSMENT**: Conflicts are resolvable - parallel development, not functional incompatibilities
- **BUSINESS VALUE**: High - addresses silent WebSocket failures (30% UX impact)

**Step 3 - BRANCH SAFETY CHECK**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Step 4 - RESOLVE MERGE CONFLICTS**: ⚠️ COMPLEX CONFLICTS FOUND
- **CRITICAL CONFLICT**: WebSocket unified manager - PR adds event confirmation vs develop-long-lived adds transaction coordinator
- **IMPACT**: Both features affect core chat functionality (90% platform value)
- **RESOLUTION**: Requires manual developer intervention to merge both features
- **SAFETY**: All operations performed safely, remained on develop-long-lived
- **DECISION**: DEFER - needs manual conflict resolution by developer

### PR #427 - SupervisorAgent missing attributes fix
**Step 1 - READ PR**: ✅ COMPLETED
- Source: `feature/issue-408-1757619766` → Target: `develop-long-lived` ✅
- Status: CONFLICTING (DIRTY merge state)
- **SCOPE**: Large change - 68 files modified addressing critical P1 issue
- **BUSINESS IMPACT**: Critical - fixes SupervisorAgent errors blocking chat (90% platform value)
- **RISK FACTORS**: No CI checks reported, large change scope, needs code review  
- **CONFLICTS**: Likely in core execution factory and test infrastructure

**Step 3 - BRANCH SAFETY CHECK**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Step 4 - RESOLVE MERGE CONFLICTS**: ⚠️ MODERATE-HIGH COMPLEXITY CONFLICTS FOUND
- **5 FILES CONFLICTED**: Core agent tracker, WebSocket manager, test infrastructure, documentation
- **CRITICAL**: WebSocket unified_manager.py conflicts affect 90% of platform value  
- **SECURITY**: Test conflicts involve UserExecutionContext vs DeepAgentState patterns
- **RESOLUTION TIME**: Estimated 2-3 hours manual resolution required
- **SAFETY**: All operations performed safely, remained on develop-long-lived
- **DECISION**: DEFER - needs expert-level manual conflict resolution

### PR #418 - Infrastructure Connectivity Cluster #395 + Related Issues Resolution
**Step 1 - READ PR**: ✅ COMPLETED  
- Source: `feature/cluster-395-1757617841` → Target: `develop-long-lived` ✅
- Status: CONFLICTING (DIRTY merge state)
- **SCOPE**: Large infrastructure fix - 49 files modified (10,819+ additions)
- **BUSINESS IMPACT**: CRITICAL - Fixes core infrastructure blocking $500K+ ARR Golden Path
- **ISSUES ADDRESSED**: GCP auth timeouts, WebSocket race conditions, VPC connectivity
- **BLOCKING**: Multiple CI failures - Unit tests, Integration tests, SSOT compliance
- **CONFLICTS**: Branch needs rebase with develop-long-lived

**Step 3 - BRANCH SAFETY CHECK**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Step 4 - BASIC CONFLICT ASSESSMENT**: ⚠️ MAJOR CI/CD FAILURES BLOCKING MERGE
- **CI STATUS**: 6/13 checks failing - Unit tests, Integration tests, E2E tests, Code Quality, SSOT compliance
- **SCOPE RISK**: Massive 53-file change affecting critical infrastructure
- **BRANCH SAFETY**: All operations performed safely, remained on develop-long-lived  
- **ASSESSMENT**: High-value infrastructure PR but needs comprehensive CI fixes before merge
- **DECISION**: BLOCK - cannot merge until all CI failures resolved
