### Current Issue Status Summary

Based on the local issue files:

**Issue Title**: GCP-regression | P0 | Application startup failure in staging environment

**Current Status**: CONFIRMED P0 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE

**Business Impact**:
- Complete $500K+ ARR service outage 1+ hours
- All staging services offline (0% availability)
- Chat functionality completely offline

**Root Cause**: Regression of previously resolved Issue #1263
- Infrastructure connectivity between Cloud Run and Cloud SQL has failed again
- VPC connector instability and network-level connectivity issues
- Socket connection failures to Cloud SQL instance

**Technical Evidence**:
- SMD Phase 3 (DATABASE) consistently timing out (35.0s timeout configured)
- FastAPI lifespan context breakdown causing exit code 3
- 649+ error entries confirming persistent infrastructure failure

**Assessment**:
- ‚úÖ Application code is CORRECT (all timeout configs, error handling working)
- ‚ùå Infrastructure layer FAILING (VPC connector/Cloud SQL connectivity)

**Next Steps Required**:
1. üö® Infrastructure team escalation required
2. Cloud SQL health check for `netra-staging:us-central1:staging-shared-postgres`
3. VPC connector diagnostics and health validation
4. Network connectivity validation between Cloud Run and Cloud SQL
