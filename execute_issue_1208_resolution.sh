CLEANUP_ISSUE_BODY="## Impact
Phantom issue #1208 referenced in automation causing confusion and wasted developer time on non-existent work.

## Current Behavior
- Issue #1208 does not exist in GitHub repository
- Referenced in automation discussions and potentially other configs
- Causes false work queues and confusion about system state

## Expected Behavior
- All automation references point to existing, valid GitHub issues
- No phantom issue references in any configuration files
- Clean automation hygiene across the platform

## Root Cause Analysis
Investigation reveals this is likely:
- A typo for another issue number (possibly #1278 - database connectivity)
- A deleted/non-existent issue that was never cleaned up from automation
- An issue that was moved to another repository without cleanup

## Immediate Actions Required
1. **Audit all automation configs** for phantom issue references
2. **Remove any references to issue #1208** from automation files
3. **Verify all other issue numbers** in automation configs actually exist
4. **Document findings** to prevent future phantom references

## Technical Details
- **Files to check**: All automation config files, particularly:
  - \`/scripts/config-issue-untangle.json\` (if referenced)
  - Any other automation configuration files
  - Documentation that may reference #1208
- **Environment**: All environments
- **Priority**: Low complexity, high value cleanup

## Prevention Strategy
- Add validation script to verify all referenced issues exist
- Update process to require issue existence validation before adding to automation configs
- Regular audits of automation configuration hygiene

## Business Value
- **Eliminates developer confusion** about non-existent work items
- **Improves automation reliability** across the platform
- **Prevents wasted time** on phantom issues
- **Sets precedent** for better automation hygiene

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All references to issue #1208 removed from automation
- [ ] Validation that all other issue references in automation are valid
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect current state
- [ ] Process improvement to prevent future phantom references

## Related Analysis

# Step 2: Create automation hygiene improvement issue
print_status "Creating automation hygiene improvement issue..."

HYGIENE_ISSUE_BODY="## Impact
Need automated validation to prevent phantom issue references in automation configurations.

## Background
Discovery of phantom issue #1208 reveals systemic gap in automation hygiene practices.

## Current Behavior
- No validation that issues referenced in automation configs actually exist
- Manual discovery of phantom references during debugging
- Potential for other phantom references to exist undetected

## Expected Behavior
- Automated validation of all issue references before commit
- CI/CD checks to prevent phantom references
- Regular audits of automation configuration health

## Proposed Solution
1. **Create validation script**: \`scripts/validate_issue_references.py\`
   - Scan all automation config files for issue numbers
   - Verify each referenced issue exists in GitHub
   - Report any phantom references found

2. **Add pre-commit hook**: Validate issue references before commits
3. **CI/CD integration**: Include validation in deployment pipeline
4. **Regular audit**: Scheduled task to check for new phantom references

## Technical Requirements
- Python script using GitHub API
- Integration with existing \`gh\` CLI tooling
- Configuration to define which files/patterns to scan
- Clear reporting of validation results

## Business Value
- **Prevents future phantom references** saving developer time
- **Improves automation reliability** across all repositories
- **Establishes best practices** for configuration management
- **Reduces debugging overhead** from phantom issues

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Validation script created and tested
- [ ] Pre-commit hook implemented
- [ ] CI/CD integration completed
- [ ] Documentation updated with new process
- [ ] All existing phantom references eliminated

## Priority
P2 - High value prevention measure that builds on cleanup work from issue #$CLEANUP_ISSUE_NUMBER

# Step 3: Create documentation improvement issue
print_status "Creating documentation improvement issue..."

DOCS_ISSUE_BODY="## Impact
Improve documentation of automation processes to prevent phantom issue references.

## Background
Phantom issue #1208 discovery reveals need for better automation documentation and processes.

## Current Behavior
- Limited documentation on automation configuration management
- No clear process for maintaining issue references
- Inconsistent practices across teams

## Expected Behavior
- Clear documentation of automation configuration patterns
- Established process for adding/removing issue references
- Training materials for team members

## Proposed Solution
1. **Create automation documentation**: \`docs/automation_configuration_guide.md\`
   - Best practices for issue reference management
   - Configuration file patterns and conventions
   - Maintenance procedures and schedules

2. **Update team processes**: Include automation hygiene in definition of done
3. **Create training materials**: Team education on automation best practices
4. **Establish review procedures**: Peer review requirements for automation changes

## Business Value
- **Prevents future phantom references** through education
- **Standardizes automation practices** across teams
- **Reduces onboarding time** for new team members
- **Improves overall code quality** and maintainability

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Automation configuration guide created
- [ ] Team processes updated to include automation hygiene
- [ ] Training materials developed and delivered
- [ ] Review procedures established and documented

## Priority
P3 - Important long-term improvement that supports cleanup and prevention work
