# Docker E2E Test Report - August 28, 2025

## Executive Summary
Production-grade E2E testing against Docker Compose environment reveals critical service health and connectivity issues preventing proper test execution.

## Test Environment Status

### Docker Services
| Service | Container | Port | Health Status | Issues |
|---------|-----------|------|---------------|---------|
| Frontend | netra-frontend | 3000 | ✅ Healthy | False auth warnings in logs |
| Backend | netra-backend | 8000 | ❌ Unhealthy | Async generator errors, non-responsive |
| Auth Service | netra-auth | 8081 | ✅ Healthy | Timeout warnings |
| PostgreSQL | netra-postgres | 5432 | ✅ Healthy | Minor warnings |
| ClickHouse | netra-clickhouse | 8123/9000 | ✅ Healthy | Normal |
| Redis | netra-redis | 6379 | ✅ Healthy | Normal |

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Backend Service Critical Failure
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Blocks all E2E testing  
**Details:**
- Backend container is marked as unhealthy
- Health check endpoint (`/health`) times out
- Multiple async generator errors in logs
- Socket hang up errors when frontend attempts connection

**Log Evidence:**
```
RuntimeError: aclose(): asynchronous generator is already running
asyncio.exceptions.CancelledError in lifespan
Failed to proxy http://backend:8000/api/mcp/tools [Error: socket hang up]
```

### 2. Port Configuration Mismatch
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Tests fail to connect to services  
**Details:**
- Auth service running on port 8081 (not 8001 as expected by tests)
- Test configuration expects different ports than Docker Compose provides

### 3. Service Communication Issues
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Cross-service authentication flows fail  
**Details:**
- Frontend cannot proxy requests to backend
- WebSocket connections fail with ECONNRESET
- Cross-service authentication tests fail completely

## Introspector Analysis Summary
- **Total Issues Found:** 335
- **Critical Issues:** 28

## E2E Test Results

### Test Execution Summary
- **Environment:** Docker Compose (dev)
- **Tests Attempted:** Cross-service authentication, Real services E2E
- **Result:** ❌ FAILED
- **Primary Failure Reason:** Backend service unavailable

### Failed Test Categories:
1. **Database Tests** - Cannot connect to backend
2. **API Tests** - Backend timeout
3. **Integration Tests** - Service communication failures
4. **E2E Tests** - Complete flow failures

### Specific Test Failures:
- `test_cross_service_authentication_flow`: Cannot connect to auth service (port mismatch)
- Backend health checks: Timeout after 120 seconds
- WebSocket connections: ECONNRESET errors

## Root Causes Analysis

### 1. Backend Async Middleware Issue
The backend service has a critical bug in its async middleware handling causing:
- Async generator cleanup failures
- Request handling deadlocks
- Health check endpoint becoming non-responsive

### 2. Configuration Inconsistency
- Test configurations expect different ports than Docker Compose provides
- Environment variables may not be properly set in containers

### 3. Service Initialization Order
- Backend may be starting before dependencies are ready
- Missing proper health check dependencies in Docker Compose

## Recommended Remediation Actions

### Immediate Actions (P0)
1. **Fix Backend Async Middleware**
   - Review and fix async generator handling in middleware
   - Ensure proper cleanup of async contexts
   - Add timeout handling for health checks

2. **Update Test Configurations**
   - Align test port configurations with Docker Compose
   - Update ServiceEndpoints class to use correct ports
   - Add environment-aware port configuration

3. **Restart Services with Proper Order**
   - Stop all services
   - Start dependencies first (postgres, redis)
   - Start auth service
   - Start backend with proper health checks
   - Start frontend

### Short-term Actions (P1)
1. **Implement Proper Health Checks**
   - Add comprehensive health check endpoints
   - Include dependency checks in health status
   - Add startup probes to prevent premature traffic

2. **Fix Service Communication**
   - Review proxy configuration in frontend
   - Ensure proper CORS settings
   - Fix WebSocket connection handling

3. **Update Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Add proper depends_on with health checks
   - Configure proper restart policies
   - Add resource limits and reservations

### Long-term Actions (P2)
1. **Implement Service Mesh**
   - Add proper service discovery
   - Implement circuit breakers
   - Add retry logic with backoff

2. **Enhance Observability**
   - Add structured logging
   - Implement distributed tracing
   - Add metrics collection

3. **Create E2E Test Suite**
   - Implement smoke tests for each service
   - Add integration test suite
   - Create user journey tests

## Next Steps

1. **Spawn Multi-Agent Team** for parallel remediation:
   - Backend Fix Agent: Address async middleware issues
   - Config Agent: Align configurations across services
   - Test Agent: Update and validate E2E tests
   - DevOps Agent: Fix Docker Compose configuration

2. **Priority Order:**
   - P0: Fix backend service (blocking all testing)
   - P1: Align configurations and ports
   - P2: Run comprehensive E2E test suite

3. **Success Criteria:**
   - All services show healthy status
   - Backend health check responds within 5 seconds
   - Cross-service authentication test passes
   - At least 80% of E2E tests pass

## Artifacts Generated
- `docker_audit_report.json` - Detailed issue analysis
- `remediation_plan.json` - Structured remediation tasks
- Docker logs captured for all services
- Test execution logs with detailed failures

## Conclusion
The Docker Compose environment is currently not suitable for production-grade E2E testing due to critical backend service failures. Immediate remediation is required to restore service health before comprehensive testing can proceed.

**Recommendation:** Focus on fixing the backend async middleware issue as the highest priority, as it blocks all other testing efforts.
