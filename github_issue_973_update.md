## ‚úÖ COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTION CONFIRMED - 2025-09-14

### Test Execution Results
Executed the full mission critical WebSocket test suite and confirmed all 3 P1 failures are still active:

```bash
python3 tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py -v
```

### Detailed Failure Analysis

#### 1. test_agent_started_event_structure - FAILED ‚ùå
```
AssertionError: agent_started event structure validation failed
assert False
```

**Current Event Payload:**
```json
{
  "correlation_id": null,
  "data": {
    "connection_id": "main_0c57c16f",
    "features": {
      "agent_orchestration": true,
      "cloud_run_optimized": true,
      "emergency_fallback": true,
      "full_business_logic": true
    },
    "golden_path_events": ["agent_started", "agent_thinking", "tool_executing", "tool_completed", "agent_completed"],
    "mode": "main"
  },
  "server_id": null,
  "timestamp": 1757857631.791312,
  "type": "connection_established"
}
```

**Root Cause:** Server returns `connection_established` instead of `agent_started` event

#### 2. test_tool_executing_event_structure - FAILED ‚ùå
```
AssertionError: tool_executing missing tool_name
assert 'tool_name' in received_event
```

**Current Event Payload:**
```json
{
  "correlation_id": null,
  "data": {"connection_id": "main_cea7ce8d", "...": "..."},
  "server_id": null, 
  "timestamp": 1757857637.180978,
  "type": "connection_established"
}
```

**Root Cause:** Server returns `connection_established` instead of `tool_executing`, missing `tool_name` field

#### 3. test_tool_completed_event_structure - FAILED ‚ùå
```
AssertionError: tool_completed missing results
assert 'results' in received_event
```

**Current Event Payload:**
```json
{
  "correlation_id": null,
  "data": {"connection_id": "main_7009a890", "...": "..."},
  "server_id": null,
  "timestamp": 1757857638.4094255,
  "type": "connection_established"
}
```

**Root Cause:** Server returns `connection_established` instead of `tool_completed`, missing `results` field

### üîç CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE PATTERN
All three failing tests show the **identical issue**:
- **WebSocket Server Problem:** Returns `connection_established` events for all test scenarios
- **Event Type Mismatch:** Never sends the expected event types (`agent_started`, `tool_executing`, `tool_completed`)
- **Missing Business Fields:** Connection metadata only, no agent/tool-specific data

### üîó Cross-Issue Coordination

#### Issue #1021 (P0 Critical)
This issue is fully encompassed by Issue #1021 "CRITICAL: WebSocket Event Structure Validation Failures - Golden Path Blocker" which:
- ‚úÖ **Covers all 3 failures** confirmed in this issue
- ‚úÖ **P0 Priority** - Higher urgency than this P1 issue  
- ‚úÖ **Actively being worked** - Already has comprehensive analysis
- ‚úÖ **Same root cause** - WebSocket server event type mismatch

#### Issue #935 (P1)  
The `tool_completed missing results` failure is also tracked separately in Issue #935, providing specific focus on tool result delivery.

### üìä Business Impact CONFIRMED
- **$500K+ ARR at risk** - All agent transparency broken
- **Golden Path BLOCKED** - Users cannot see agent progress
- **Chat functionality degraded** - Real-time feedback loop broken

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RECOMMENDATION: Issue Consolidation
Given that Issue #1021 (P0) comprehensively covers all failures in this issue with higher priority and active development, consider:
1. **Coordinate fixes** through Issue #1021 as the primary tracker
2. **Link this issue** to Issue #1021 for comprehensive tracking
3. **Focus development resources** on the P0 issue for faster resolution

**Status:** P1 CONFIRMED - All failures reproduced, root cause identified, coordinated with Issue #1021

**Next Steps:**
1. Align with Issue #1021 comprehensive fix approach
2. Fix WebSocket server to emit correct event types
3. Ensure event payloads contain business-required fields
