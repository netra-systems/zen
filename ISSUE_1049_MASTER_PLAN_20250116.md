```

## Phase 3: Cleanup Tasks

### 3.1 Test Infrastructure Cleanup
**Target:** Remove 450+ redundant WebSocket test files

**Categories to Clean:**
- [ ] **Duplicate Test Implementations:** Near-identical tests with minor variations
- [ ] **Backup Files:** `.backup.20250915_*` files from refactoring attempts
- [ ] **Outdated Structure Tests:** Tests expecting pre-#1021 flat event structure
- [ ] **Unused Validation Logic:** Repeated event validation across different suites

**Cleanup Commands:**
```bash
# Identify backup files
find . -name "*.backup.20250915_*" -type f

# Find WebSocket test duplicates
python scripts/analyze_test_duplicates.py --category websocket

# Validate current test structure
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category websocket --validate-structure
```

### 3.2 Documentation Updates
**Files to Update:**
- [ ] `C:\netra-apex\docs\GOLDEN_PATH_USER_FLOW_COMPLETE.md` - Update with current event structure
- [ ] `C:\netra-apex\docs\agent_architecture_mermaid.md` - Add payload wrapper details
- [ ] `C:\netra-apex\SPEC\learnings\websocket_agent_integration_critical.xml` - Mark #1021 as canonical fix

### 3.3 Monitoring Additions
**Components to Add:**
- [ ] **Event Structure Validation:** Real-time payload structure verification
- [ ] **Test Health Monitoring:** Automated detection of outdated test expectations
- [ ] **Documentation Sync:** Alerts when code changes without doc updates

## Phase 4: Verification Steps

### 4.1 Confirm WebSocket Events Working
**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Run mission critical WebSocket tests
python tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py

# Verify all 5 critical events are sent
python tests/integration/test_websocket_event_delivery.py

# Check payload structure compliance
python scripts/validate_websocket_payload_structure.py
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] All 5 critical events (agent_started, agent_thinking, tool_executing, tool_completed, agent_completed) sent
- [ ] Payload wrapper structure consistent: `{"payload": processed_data}`
- [ ] Frontend receiving and processing events correctly
- [ ] No event delivery failures in logs

### 4.2 Validate Issue #1021 Fix Still Effective
**Check Points:**
- [ ] WebSocket event structure using payload wrapper
- [ ] No regression to flat `**processed_data` structure
- [ ] Event monitoring reporting healthy status
- [ ] Production metrics showing stable event delivery

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check current event structure implementation
grep -r "payload.*processed_data" netra_backend/app/websocket_core/

# Verify no regression to old structure
grep -r "\*\*processed_data" netra_backend/app/ | grep -v test | grep -v backup
```

### 4.3 Ensure No Regressions
**Regression Checks:**
- [ ] **Production Stability:** WebSocket events continue working in production
- [ ] **Test Coverage:** No loss of test coverage during cleanup
- [ ] **Performance:** Event delivery performance maintained or improved
- [ ] **User Experience:** No degradation in real-time chat experience

**Monitoring Commands:**
```bash
# Run full WebSocket test suite
python tests/unified_test_runner.py --category websocket --real-services

# Check production metrics
python scripts/check_websocket_production_metrics.py

# Validate golden path still working
python tests/golden_path/run_golden_path_validation.py
```
