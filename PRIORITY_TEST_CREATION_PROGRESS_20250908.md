# Priority Test Creation Progress Report - 100+ Tests Initiative
## Date: 2025-09-08 
## Mission: Create 100+ High Quality Tests (Unit, Integration, E2E)

### Executive Summary
Creating comprehensive test coverage following TEST_CREATION_GUIDE.md and CLAUDE.md best practices.
Target: 100+ real, high-quality tests across all layers.
Expected Duration: 20 hours of focused work.

### Coverage Analysis Results
```
Current Coverage: 0.0% line, 0.0% branch
Files needing attention: 1453/1470
```

### Top 5 Immediate Priority Areas (Priority Score 73.0)
1. **agent_execution_core.py** - Core agent execution logic
2. **websocket_notifier.py** - WebSocket event notifications 
3. **tool_dispatcher.py** - Tool dispatch coordination
4. **tool_dispatcher_core.py** - Core tool dispatcher functionality
5. **tool_dispatcher_execution.py** - Tool execution management

### Test Creation Strategy
#### Phase 1: Unit Tests (Target: 40+ tests)
- Focus on core business logic
- Individual function/method testing
- ZERO mocks for external dependencies where possible
- Real database interactions via test fixtures

#### Phase 2: Integration Tests (Target: 40+ tests) 
- **CRITICAL**: No Docker required, but NO MOCKS
- Cross-component interaction testing
- Database + business logic integration
- WebSocket + agent integration patterns
- Bridge gap between unit and e2e

#### Phase 3: E2E Tests (Target: 20+ tests)
- Full system workflows with real services
- **MANDATORY AUTH**: All e2e tests MUST use real authentication
- Real WebSocket connections and events
- Complete user journeys

### Progress Tracking
#### Tests Created: 0 / 100+
- [ ] Unit Tests: 0 / 40+
- [ ] Integration Tests: 0 / 40+ 
- [ ] E2E Tests: 0 / 20+

#### Quality Standards Checklist
- [ ] ZERO test cheating - all tests designed to FAIL HARD
- [ ] NO mocks in integration/e2e (unit tests only if absolutely necessary)
- [ ] All e2e tests use real authentication flows
- [ ] All tests follow absolute import patterns
- [ ] Test timing validation (e2e tests must take >0.00s)
