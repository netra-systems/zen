### Recently Active Issues (from Git History)
- **Issue #1278**: Database connectivity emergency (P0) - Infrastructure capacity constraints causing SMD Phase 3 timeouts
- **Issue #1270**: SSOT Legacy Removal - Pattern filtering and test categories
- **Issue #1263**: Database connection configuration for staging deployment
- **Issue #1227**: Golden Path test imports with SSOT compliance
- **Issue #1196**: WebSocket Manager SSOT consolidation
- **Issue #1186**: SSOT consolidation validation
- **Issue #1184**: WebSocket Manager await error (with session tags)
- **Issue #1177/#1178**: SSOT audit results (98.7% compliance achieved)

- **Issue #849**: WebSocket 1011 error fixes via Redis SSOT consolidation
- **Issue #226**: Redis SSOT violations (102 violations across 80 files)

### Evidence of Tracking
- Multiple test files reference existing issues
- Comprehensive documentation in `reports/` and `SPEC/learnings/`
- Git commit history shows active issue resolution
- Session tag scripts for issues #914, #1184, #1115

## New Issues Created (Issue Content Files)

Since direct GitHub CLI access was restricted, comprehensive issue descriptions have been prepared:

### 1. Asyncio Event Loop Errors (NEW)
**File:** `issue-asyncio-event-loop-e2e-failures.md`
**Priority:** P0-Critical
**Summary:** E2E tests failing with `RuntimeError: This event loop is already running`
**Business Impact:** Blocks validation of $500K+ ARR functionality
**Suggested Labels:** P0-Critical, asyncio, e2e-tests, golden-path, testing-infrastructure

### 2. Redis SSOT Violations (EXPANSION of Issue #226)
**File:** `issue-redis-ssot-violations-blocking-chat.md`
**Priority:** P0-Critical
**Summary:** 12 competing Redis managers causing 85% WebSocket 1011 error probability
**Business Impact:** $500K+ ARR chat functionality at risk
**Suggested Labels:** P0-Critical, redis, ssot-violation, websocket-1011, chat-functionality

### 3. Golden Path Production Readiness (NEW)
**File:** `issue-golden-path-production-readiness-failure.md`
**Priority:** P0-Critical
**Summary:** Overall production readiness assessment failing across all metrics
**Business Impact:** Core business value delivery blocked (90% of platform value)
**Suggested Labels:** P0-Critical, golden-path, production-readiness, business-critical

### 4. WebSocket-Redis Integration Instability (NEW)
**File:** `issue-websocket-redis-integration-instability.md`
**Priority:** P0-Critical
**Summary:** System-wide integration failures with 25% connection pool efficiency
**Business Impact:** Infrastructure stability compromised
**Suggested Labels:** P0-Critical, websocket, redis, integration, performance

## Critical Metrics Summary

### Current System Health (From Test Reports)
- **E2E Test Pass Rate**: 0% (5/5 tests failing)
- **Overall Production Readiness**: False
- **Redis SSOT Score**: 25/100 (Critical)
- **WebSocket Stability**: 30/100 (Critical)
- **Integration Health**: 20/100 (Critical)
- **WebSocket 1011 Error Probability**: 85%
- **Chat Functionality Readiness**: False
- **User Connection Reliability**: 65%
- **Agent Execution Reliability**: 70%

### Business Impact Assessment
- **Revenue at Risk**: $500K+ ARR from core chat functionality
- **Customer Impact**: All tiers affected (Free/Early/Mid/Enterprise)
- **Production Deployment**: Blocked due to stability concerns
- **Development Velocity**: Impacted by test infrastructure failures

## Recommendations for GitHub Issue Management

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Create the four new issues** using the prepared content files
2. **Prioritize Issue #1278** (database infrastructure) as it's blocking staging
3. **Escalate Redis SSOT consolidation** (expand Issue #226 scope)
4. **Track golden path production readiness** as business-critical

### Issue Interconnections
- Redis SSOT violations → WebSocket 1011 errors → Golden path failures
- Asyncio event loop issues → E2E test failures → Cannot validate fixes
- Database infrastructure → Production readiness → Business value delivery
- WebSocket-Redis integration → System stability → Monitoring blind spots

### Next Steps
1. Use the prepared `.md` files to create GitHub issues manually through the web interface
2. Link related issues to show dependencies
3. Update existing Issue #226 with expanded Redis SSOT scope
4. Track progress through the Definition of Done checklist

## Files Created for Issue Tracking
- `issue-asyncio-event-loop-e2e-failures.md`
- `issue-redis-ssot-violations-blocking-chat.md`
- `issue-golden-path-production-readiness-failure.md`
- `issue-websocket-redis-integration-instability.md`
- `GITHUB_ISSUES_TRACKING_REPORT.md` (this file)
