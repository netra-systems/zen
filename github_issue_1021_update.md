## Current Status Update - 2025-09-14

### Test Execution Results
Executed mission critical WebSocket tests and confirmed the 3 P1 failures are still active:

#### 1. test_agent_started_event_structure - FAILED
```
AssertionError: agent_started event structure validation failed
```

**Current Event Payload:**
```json
{
  "correlation_id": null,
  "data": {
    "connection_id": "main_0c57c16f",
    "features": {
      "agent_orchestration": true,
      "cloud_run_optimized": true,
      "emergency_fallback": true,
      "full_business_logic": true
    },
    "golden_path_events": ["agent_started", "agent_thinking", "tool_executing", "tool_completed", "agent_completed"],
    "mode": "main"
  },
  "server_id": null,
  "timestamp": 1757857631.791312,
  "type": "connection_established"
}
```

**Issue:** Event structure validation failing - expected agent_started specific fields missing

#### 2. test_tool_executing_event_structure - FAILED  
```
AssertionError: tool_executing missing tool_name
assert 'tool_name' in received_event
```

**Current Event Payload:**
```json
{
  "correlation_id": null,
  "data": {"connection_id": "main_cea7ce8d", "...": "..."},
  "server_id": null, 
  "timestamp": 1757857637.180978,
  "type": "connection_established"
}
```

**Issue:** Missing required `tool_name` field in tool_executing events

#### 3. test_tool_completed_event_structure - FAILED
```
AssertionError: tool_completed missing results
assert 'results' in received_event
```

**Current Event Payload:**
```json
{
  "correlation_id": null,
  "data": {"connection_id": "main_7009a890", "...": "..."},
  "server_id": null,
  "timestamp": 1757857638.4094255,
  "type": "connection_established"
}
```

**Issue:** Missing required `results` field in tool_completed events

### Root Cause Analysis
The WebSocket server is returning `connection_established` events instead of the specific event types (`agent_started`, `tool_executing`, `tool_completed`) that the tests are expecting. This indicates a fundamental disconnect between what the server is sending vs what the validation expects.

### Business Impact
- **$500K+ ARR at risk** from WebSocket event failures  
- **Golden Path BLOCKED** - Core chat functionality compromised
- **User Experience degraded** - No visibility into agent progress

### Next Steps
1. âœ… **CONFIRMED** - All 3 failures reproduced with staging environment
2. **INVESTIGATE** - Why server sends `connection_established` instead of specific event types
3. **FIX** - Align event emission with validation requirements
4. **VALIDATE** - Re-run mission critical tests until 100% pass

**Status:** P0 CRITICAL - Actively blocking Golden Path user flow

**Test Command Used:**
```bash  
python3 tests/mission_critical/test_websocket_agent_events_suite.py -v
