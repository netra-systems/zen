Test Issue #1176 Phase 1 Fix Validation
========================================

This test validates that the core fix for Issue #1176 is working correctly.
The fix ensures that:
1. total_tests_run == 0 returns failure (exit code 1)
2. Fast collection mode returns failure instead of false success
3. Anti-recursive patterns are prevented
