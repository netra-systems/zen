Date: 2025-09-03
Deployment Status: SUCCESSFUL with ISSUES

## Deployment Summary
- **Backend Service**: Deployed successfully to https://netra-backend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app
- **Auth Service**: Deployed successfully to https://netra-auth-service-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app  
- **Frontend Service**: Deployed successfully to https://netra-frontend-staging-pnovr5vsba-uc.a.run.app

## Issues Identified and Five Whys Analysis

### Issue 1: ClickHouse Circuit Breaker Open
**Error**: `CircuitBreakerOpenError: SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE: Circuit breaker 'clickhouse' is OPEN`

**Five Whys Analysis**:
1. **Why is the circuit breaker open?**
   - Because ClickHouse connections are failing repeatedly
   
2. **Why are ClickHouse connections failing?**
   - Because ClickHouse server is not accessible from Cloud Run
   
3. **Why is ClickHouse not accessible?**
   - Because ClickHouse is not deployed in the staging environment
   
4. **Why is ClickHouse not deployed?**
   - Because the deployment script doesn't include ClickHouse service setup
   
5. **Why doesn't the script include ClickHouse?**
   - Because ClickHouse requires separate infrastructure setup (VM/managed service)

**Root Cause**: Missing ClickHouse infrastructure in staging environment
**Solution**: Deploy ClickHouse on GCP (Cloud SQL for ClickHouse or VM) or disable in staging

### Issue 2: Post-deployment Authentication Test Failure
**Error**: `name 'env' is not defined`

**Five Whys Analysis**:
1. **Why is 'env' undefined?**
   - Because the test script has an import error
   
2. **Why is there an import error?**
   - Because the test is trying to use a variable that wasn't imported
   
3. **Why wasn't it imported?**
   - Because the deployment script's test code is missing the import statement
   
4. **Why is the import missing?**
   - Because the test was written assuming environment variables are globally available
   
5. **Why was this assumption made?**
   - Because the test wasn't properly updated after refactoring environment management

**Root Cause**: Missing import in deployment test script
**Solution**: Fix import in deploy_to_gcp.py authentication test section

### Issue 3: WebSocket Connection Errors (Intermittent)
**Error**: Multiple WebSocket middleware errors in traceback

**Five Whys Analysis**:
1. **Why are WebSocket connections failing?**
   - Because the middleware chain is encountering errors
   
2. **Why is the middleware encountering errors?**
   - Because some WebSocket events are malformed or missing required fields
   
3. **Why are events malformed?**
   - Because the client and server WebSocket protocol might be mismatched
   
4. **Why is there a protocol mismatch?**
   - Because frontend and backend were deployed with different versions
   
5. **Why were different versions deployed?**
   - Because there's no version synchronization check in deployment

**Root Cause**: Potential version mismatch between services
**Solution**: Implement version validation between services

## Test Results on Staging
- Backend Health Check: ✅ PASSING (200 OK)
- Auth Service Health Check: ✅ PASSING (200 OK)  
- Frontend Health Check: ✅ PASSING (200 OK)
- Database Connection: ✅ CONNECTED (per auth service health)
- ClickHouse Connection: ❌ FAILING (circuit breaker open)

## Recommendations
1. **CRITICAL**: Deploy ClickHouse infrastructure or implement staging-specific config
2. **HIGH**: Fix authentication test import in deployment script
3. **MEDIUM**: Add service version validation
4. **LOW**: Improve error logging for WebSocket events

## Next Steps
1. Configure ClickHouse for staging or disable if not needed
2. Fix deployment script test imports
3. Run comprehensive E2E tests once infrastructure is complete
