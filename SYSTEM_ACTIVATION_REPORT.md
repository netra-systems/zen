   - Batch processor for scalability
   - Progress tracker with real-time updates
   - Multiple preset workload profiles

2. **Testing Coverage**
   - 18 Cypress E2E tests for UI flows
   - Unit and integration tests
   - Performance and quality assurance tests

3. **Ready for Activation:**
   - Log ingestion demo capability
   - Industry-specific data generation
   - WebSocket progress streaming
   - Metrics and approval handlers

### Goal #4: Testing Infrastructure
**Status: ADVANCED**

#### Major Improvements:
1. **Unified Test Runner**
   - Layer-based orchestration (fast_feedback, core_integration, service_integration, e2e_background)
   - Execution modes: fast_feedback (2min), nightly, background, hybrid
   - Real-time progress streaming
   - Resource management

2. **Mission Critical Suite**
   - 60+ critical tests ensuring core functionality
   - WebSocket reliability tests
   - Authentication state consistency
   - SSOT compliance validation

3. **Service Availability**
   - Hard failures when real services unavailable
   - Clear remediation steps
   - Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse checks

## ðŸš€ Biggest Recent Changes

### 1. Complete Environment Migration (Last 10 commits)
```
- refactor(test-framework): complete environment migration
- refactor(tests): complete test suite migration  
- refactor(tests): migrate integration and critical tests
- refactor(e2e): migrate e2e tests to IsolatedEnvironment
- refactor(scripts): migrate scripts to IsolatedEnvironment
```
**Impact:** Eliminated configuration drift, ensured consistency across all services

### 2. WebSocket Silent Failure Prevention
- Comprehensive masterclass learning document created
- 5 critical failure points identified and fixed
- Explicit error propagation implemented
- Dependency injection validation added
- Production monitoring patterns established

### 3. JWT Secret Standardization
- Hard requirements with no fallbacks
- Environment-specific secrets enforced
- Immediate failure on missing configuration
- Cross-service token validation fixed

## ðŸ“Š System Health Metrics

### SSOT Compliance
- **Environment Variables:** âœ… 100% unified
- **Configuration Architecture:** âœ… Documented and enforced
- **Import Management:** âœ… Absolute imports only
- **Service Independence:** âœ… 100% maintained

### Test Coverage
- **Mission Critical:** 60+ tests
